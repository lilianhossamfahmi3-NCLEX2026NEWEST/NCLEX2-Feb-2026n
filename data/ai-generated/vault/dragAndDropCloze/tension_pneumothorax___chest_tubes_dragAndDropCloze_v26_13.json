      "correct": "A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrapleural pressure. This compresses the lung on the affected side and shifts mediastinal structures towards the unaffected side. Decreased venous return is a direct consequence of the increased intrathoracic pressure compressing the great vessels, primarily the vena cava. This leads to reduced cardiac output and subsequent hypotension. Hypoxia results from the collapsed lung's inability to participate in gas exchange. Tracheal deviation occurs away from the affected side due to the pressure buildup. Increased work of breathing is a compensatory mechanism due to impaired ventilation.",

      "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. Johnson, 68-year-old male, post-op Day 1 right lung wedge resection, reporting increased shortness of breath. New onset diaphoresis and anxiety noted at 10:15. Background: History of COPD, otherwise healthy. Surgery was uncomplicated. Assessment: Breath sounds diminished on the right, hyperresonance to percussion. HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 and labored, SpO2 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Trachea deviated to the left. Dressing intact, minimal drainage. Chest tube output minimal over the past hour. Pain level 6/10. Recommendation: STAT chest X-ray and possible intervention for suspected tension pneumothorax. Needs urgent evaluation for possible chest tube malfunction or development of a new pneumothorax. Prepare for possible needle decompression if condition deteriorates rapidly.",
