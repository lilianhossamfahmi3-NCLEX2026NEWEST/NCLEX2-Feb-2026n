A: Respiratory distress likely due to GBS-related muscle weakness. Potential for respiratory failure. Neuro checks indicate ascending paralysis. Reflexes diminished bilaterally. 07:30: ABG ordered. Notified MD of patient's condition and respiratory status. R: Requesting urgent evaluation for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Keep patient NPO in anticipation of intubation. 07:45: Patient reports feeling more tired. SpO2 dropping despite oxygen. RR 35, shallow. Color pale. ABG results pending."
