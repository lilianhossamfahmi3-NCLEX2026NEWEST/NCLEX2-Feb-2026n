Vitals: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm (irregular), RR 24, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F), SpO2 94% on room air. ECG shows peaked T waves. Potassium 7.0 mEq/L. Complaining of muscle cramps; minimal urine output. R: Notified physician, received stat orders: Continuous cardiac monitoring, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) 15g PO, calcium gluconate 1g IV over 5 minutes, prepare for emergent hemodialysis. Monitor potassium hourly, restrict dietary potassium, continuous telemetry, frequent vitals, assess for fluid overload. Nephrology consult requested.

        "drag1": "In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys' ability to excrete potassium is significantly impaired, leading to hyperkalemia. The failing kidneys cannot effectively filter and eliminate potassium from the body, causing it to accumulate in the bloodstream. This is further exacerbated by the reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) typical in CKD.",
        "drag2": "Peaked T waves are a classic ECG finding in hyperkalemia. The elevated potassium levels affect the repolarization of the heart, resulting in the characteristic tall and peaked T waves. As hyperkalemia worsens, other ECG changes can include widened QRS complexes, prolonged PR interval, and ultimately, a sine wave pattern, which can lead to fatal arrhythmias.",
        "drag3": "Calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac membrane by increasing the threshold potential, thereby reducing the excitability of the heart muscle. This action protects the heart from the adverse effects of hyperkalemia, such as arrhythmias. It does not lower potassium levels but provides immediate cardiac protection while other treatments to reduce potassium are initiated.",
        "correct": "The correct answers reflect the pathophysiology of hyperkalemia in CKD and the immediate interventions required to stabilize the patient. Decreased renal excretion leads to hyperkalemia, which manifests as peaked T waves on ECG. Calcium gluconate is administered to protect the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia.",

            "Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardiac protection but does not lower potassium levels. Other treatments, such as insulin and glucose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), or dialysis, are required to reduce potassium levels.
