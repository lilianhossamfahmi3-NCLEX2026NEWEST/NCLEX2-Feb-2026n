      "SBAR": "14:00. S: Mr. Jones, 68-year-old male, admitted with CKD, now presenting with weakness, palpitations, and nausea. Patient states symptoms started this morning. B: History of CKD (Stage 4), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Currently on hemodialysis three times weekly. Last dialysis was two days ago. A: Alert and oriented but appears weak. Initial vital signs: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm and irregular, RR 24, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F), SpO2 94% on room air. ECG shows peaked T waves. Serum potassium level is 7.0 mEq/L. Patient is complaining of muscle cramps. Urine output is minimal. R: Physician notified and stat orders received: Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring, administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) 15g PO, administer calcium gluconate 1g IV over 5 minutes, prepare for possible emergent hemodialysis. Monitor potassium levels hourly. Restrict dietary potassium intake. Ensure continuous telemetry monitoring and frequent vital sign checks. Assess for signs of fluid overload. Contact nephrology for urgent consultation. Patient education regarding low potassium diet to be reinforced post-acute phase.",

      "drag1": "In chronic kidney disease, the kidneys' ability to excrete potassium is impaired, leading to hyperkalemia. The failing kidneys cannot effectively filter and eliminate potassium from the body, causing it to accumulate in the bloodstream.",
      "drag2": "Peaked T waves are a classic ECG finding in hyperkalemia. The elevated potassium levels affect the repolarization of the heart, resulting in the characteristic tall and peaked T waves. Other ECG changes can include widened QRS complexes and a prolonged PR interval.",
      "drag3": "Calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac membrane by raising the threshold potential, thereby reducing the excitability of the heart muscle. This helps to prevent arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. It does not lower potassium levels but protects the heart from its effects."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with renal failure. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential to prevent cardiac complications.",
      "ECG changes are crucial indicators of hyperkalemia severity. Peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and prolonged PR intervals are common findings.",
      "Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardiac protection but does not lower potassium levels. Other treatments, such as insulin and glucose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or dialysis, are required to reduce potassium levels."
    ],
    "questionTrap": "Students may confuse the treatments for hyperkalemia, focusing on potassium removal (e.g., Kayexalate) rather than immediate cardiac stabilization. Prioritizing interventions based on the urgency of the situation is key.",
    "mnemonic": "KID:  Kidneys excrete Potassium.  Remember that hyperKalemia ECG changes include peaked T waves, prolonged PR, and widened QRS.",
