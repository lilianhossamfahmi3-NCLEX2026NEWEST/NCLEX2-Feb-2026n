    "correct": "Asterixis, also known as a liver flap, is a characteristic sign of hepatic encephalopathy. This neurological complication arises from the liver's inability to effectively remove ammonia from the bloodstream. The elevated ammonia levels cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological dysfunction, including the involuntary flapping tremor. Ascites, the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, is primarily caused by portal hypertension (increased pressure in the portal vein) and hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood). Portal hypertension forces fluid out of the liver and into the peritoneal space, while low albumin reduces the oncotic pressure in the blood, further contributing to fluid leakage.",
    "incorrect": "Spider angiomas are small, dilated blood vessels visible on the skin, commonly found in individuals with cirrhosis due to increased estrogen levels. Esophageal varices are enlarged, fragile veins in the esophagus that develop as a result of portal hypertension. These varices are prone to rupture and bleeding, a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis. While both spider angiomas and esophageal varices are clinical signs of cirrhosis, they do not directly explain the flapping tremor (asterixis) or the fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites).",
