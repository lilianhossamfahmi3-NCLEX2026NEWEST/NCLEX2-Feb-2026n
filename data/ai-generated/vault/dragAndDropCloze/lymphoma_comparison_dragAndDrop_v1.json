    "correct": "Hodgkin's Lymphoma is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal lymphocytes with multiple nuclei. These cells release cytokines that attract other immune cells, leading to lymph node enlargement and systemic symptoms. The pathophysiology involves genetic mutations and viral infections (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus) that disrupt normal lymphocyte development and apoptosis. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma encompasses a diverse group of lymphomas that lack Reed-Sternberg cells. These lymphomas arise from various types of lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, NK cells) and can occur in any lymphoid tissue. The pathophysiology involves chromosomal translocations, gene mutations, and viral infections that lead to uncontrolled lymphocyte proliferation and impaired apoptosis.",
    "incorrect": {
      "Multiple Myeloma": "Multiple Myeloma is a plasma cell cancer characterized by the overproduction of abnormal antibodies (paraproteins) and bone destruction. It does not primarily affect lymph nodes. The pathophysiology involves genetic abnormalities in plasma cells that lead to their uncontrolled proliferation in the bone marrow, resulting in anemia, bone pain, and hypercalcemia. Bence-Jones proteins are light chain immunoglobulins found in the urine.",
      "Leukemia": "Leukemia is a cancer of the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, leading to the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. While leukemia can cause lymph node enlargement, it is not the primary diagnostic feature. The pathophysiology involves genetic mutations that disrupt normal hematopoiesis, leading to the accumulation of immature or abnormal white blood cells in the blood and bone marrow, causing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased susceptibility to infection."
