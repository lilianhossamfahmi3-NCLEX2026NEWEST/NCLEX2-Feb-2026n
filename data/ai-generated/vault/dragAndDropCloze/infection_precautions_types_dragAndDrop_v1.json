    "correct": "Disseminated Herpes Zoster, or shingles, involves widespread lesions, making it contagious through both airborne particles and direct contact with the lesions. Therefore, airborne and contact precautions are necessary to prevent transmission. Bacterial Meningitis is transmitted through large respiratory droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking. Droplet precautions, including wearing a surgical mask, are crucial to prevent the spread of the infection.",
    "incorrect": {
      "Airborne": "Airborne precautions alone are insufficient for disseminated Herpes Zoster because the virus can also spread through direct contact with lesions.",
      "Contact": "Contact precautions alone are insufficient for Bacterial Meningitis as it primarily spreads through respiratory droplets.",
      "Standard": "Standard precautions are always implemented, but they are not sufficient when a specific mode of transmission is known, such as airborne or droplet."
