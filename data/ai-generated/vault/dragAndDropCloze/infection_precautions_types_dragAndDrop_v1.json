    "correct": "Disseminated Herpes Zoster requires Airborne and Contact Precautions due to the potential for both airborne and direct contact transmission of the virus from widespread lesions. Bacterial Meningitis requires Droplet Precautions because it is transmitted through respiratory droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking.",

      "Airborne and Contact Precautions": "While Airborne and Contact Precautions are necessary for disseminated Herpes Zoster, they are not the primary precautions for Bacterial Meningitis, which is spread via droplets.",

      "Contact Precautions": "Contact Precautions alone are insufficient for both conditions. Disseminated Herpes Zoster also requires Airborne Precautions, and Bacterial Meningitis requires Droplet Precautions.",
