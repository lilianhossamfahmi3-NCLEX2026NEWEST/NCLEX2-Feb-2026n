He is sitting upright, drooling, and appears anxious. \nBackground: Mother reports that Ethan developed a sore throat and fever yesterday. Symptoms rapidly worsened overnight. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, but has no prior history of respiratory issues. \nAssessment: Stridor is audible, and Ethan is exhibiting signs of respiratory distress, including nasal flaring and retractions. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. He is refusing to lie down. \nRecommendation: Prepare for potential intubation. Avoid agitating the child or examining the throat. Keep emergency airway equipment readily available. Notify ENT and anesthesia immediately. Transfer to PICU once stabilized."
