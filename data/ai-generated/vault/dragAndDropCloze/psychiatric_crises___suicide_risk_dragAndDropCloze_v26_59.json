        "correct": "Rationale:\n\n*   **every 15 minutes:** Frequent monitoring is essential for patients at high risk for suicide to allow for timely intervention if the patient's behavior escalates. This ensures the patient's safety by providing constant observation and immediate response to any changes in their condition.\n*   **report the finding immediately:** Any increase in suicidal ideation or intent necessitates immediate reporting to the healthcare provider to reassess the patient's risk level and adjust the care plan accordingly. Prompt reporting allows for timely intervention and potential adjustments to the treatment plan.\n*   **remove all potentially harmful objects:** Removing potentially harmful objects such as sharp items, cords, and medications is crucial to minimize the risk of self-harm. This creates a safer environment for the patient, reducing the opportunity for self-inflicted harm.",

No prior suicide attempts documented, but has expressed passive suicidal ideation in the past. Denies current substance abuse.\n\n**Assessment:** Patient is currently alert and oriented, but withdrawn and tearful. He expresses feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. Reports ongoing suicidal ideation, but denies any current plan. No signs of psychosis observed. Vital signs stable. Suicide risk assessment indicates high risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** Continue close monitoring with visual checks every 15 minutes, implement safety precautions (removal of harmful objects), and encourage engagement in therapeutic activities. Consult with psychiatrist regarding medication management and consider individual therapy. Ensure lorazepam 1mg PO PRN anxiety is available.",
