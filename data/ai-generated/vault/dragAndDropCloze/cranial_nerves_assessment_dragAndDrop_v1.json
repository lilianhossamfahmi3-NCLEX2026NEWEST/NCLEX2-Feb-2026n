    "correct": "**CN XI (Spinal Accessory):** This nerve controls the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, which are responsible for head rotation and shoulder shrugging. Assessing the client's ability to shrug their shoulders against resistance tests the function of CN XI.\n\n**CN III (Oculomotor):** This nerve controls most of the eye's movements, including pupillary constriction, upper eyelid elevation, and adduction, elevation, and depression of the eyeball. Assessing the client's ability to follow a finger without moving their head tests the extraocular movements controlled by CN III. Dysfunction can lead to ptosis (drooping eyelid) or diplopia (double vision).",
    "incorrect": "**CN VII (Facial):** Controls facial expressions, taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and lacrimation. Assessment involves observing facial symmetry during smiling, frowning, and raising eyebrows.\n\n**CN V (Trigeminal):** Responsible for facial sensation and muscles of mastication (chewing). Assessment includes testing corneal reflex and palpating the temporal and masseter muscles during jaw clenching.\n\n**CN II (Optic):** Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Assessment involves testing visual acuity using a Snellen chart and visual fields by confrontation.",

They are often tested together using the 'H' or 'Star' pattern to assess extraocular movements (EOMs). Remember that CN IV controls superior oblique and CN VI controls lateral rectus. CN III controls the rest of the EOMs."
