  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Continuous bubbling in the water-seal chamber indicates an air leak within the system or from the patient's pleural space. This occurs because air is escaping and passing through the water seal. Intermittent bubbling in the water-seal chamber during expiration (or coughing/sneezing) is a normal finding, indicating that air is being evacuated from the pleural space with each breath. This tidaling will cease once the lung has fully re-expanded.",
    "incorrect": "An obstructed or kinked chest tube would typically cause a lack of tidaling (cessation of oscillation) in the water-seal chamber, not continuous bubbling. This prevents air and fluid from draining properly, potentially leading to a tension pneumothorax.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Always keep the drainage system BELOW the level of the patient's chest to promote gravity drainage and prevent backflow.",
      "Assess the chest tube insertion site for signs of infection (redness, swelling, drainage) and subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus).",
      "Encourage the patient to cough and deep breathe regularly to promote lung expansion and drainage."

      "howToOvercome": "Remember that continuous bubbling is NORMAL in the suction control chamber (if suction is applied) but ABNORMAL in the water-seal chamber, indicating an air leak. Focus on the location of the bubbling to determine the cause."
