    "correct": "Dehiscence is the partial or complete separation of the outer wound layers, while evisceration involves the protrusion of internal organs through the incision. In evisceration, the primary nursing intervention is to protect the exposed organs from contamination and desiccation. Sterile, saline-soaked gauze provides a moist, sterile barrier, preventing infection and tissue damage. This action buys time while preparing the patient for surgical intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Dry gauze can adhere to the organs, causing further damage upon removal. Povidone-iodine is cytotoxic and can damage exposed tissues and is not appropriate for direct application to internal organs.",

Keep the client NPO in anticipation of possible surgical intervention. Provide emotional support and education to the client regarding the situation and plan of care."
