    "correct": "Airborne precautions are essential for TB due to the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis via airborne droplet nuclei. An N95 respirator, which filters out at least 95% of airborne particles, is required for healthcare personnel to prevent inhalation of these infectious particles. The client wears a surgical mask to contain respiratory secretions at the source, reducing the risk of transmission during transport.",
    "incorrect": "Surgical masks do NOT provide adequate protection against airborne particles for healthcare workers. N95 respirators are not typically placed on clients due to potential breathing difficulties and valve/seal issues that may compromise source control. Face shields and goggles protect against splashes and sprays, not airborne particles. Gloves protect against contact transmission, not airborne transmission.",

      "TB rooms must have negative pressure, with air exhausted directly outside or filtered through a HEPA filter, to prevent the spread of infectious particles within the facility.",
      "Confirming proper N95 fit is crucial; healthcare personnel should be fit-tested annually and perform a seal check each time the respirator is donned.",
      "Administer anti-TB medications as prescribed (e.g., isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) and monitor for adverse effects.",
