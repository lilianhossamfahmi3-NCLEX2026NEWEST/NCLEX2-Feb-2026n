    "correct": "**Protamine Sulfate (Heparin Antidote):** Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin formation, preventing clot formation. An overdose leads to excessive bleeding. Protamine sulfate, a strong base, binds to heparin (an acid) to form a stable salt complex, neutralizing heparin's anticoagulant activity. This action reverses the bleeding risk associated with heparin overdose.\n\n**Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) - Acetaminophen Antidote:** Acetaminophen overdose leads to the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which depletes glutathione stores in the liver. Glutathione is essential for detoxifying NAPQI. Acetylcysteine (NAC) replenishes glutathione, allowing for the detoxification of NAPQI and preventing liver damage. NAC is most effective when administered within 8-10 hours of acetaminophen ingestion.",
    "incorrect": "**Vitamin K:** Reverses the effects of Warfarin (Coumadin) by promoting the synthesis of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) in the liver. It does not affect Heparin or Acetaminophen.\n\n**Flumazenil:** A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam). It has no effect on Heparin or Acetaminophen toxicity.\n\n**Naloxone:** An opioid antagonist used to reverse the effects of opioid medications (e.g., morphine, fentanyl). It competitively binds to opioid receptors, blocking the effects of opioids. It does not affect Heparin or Acetaminophen toxicity.",
