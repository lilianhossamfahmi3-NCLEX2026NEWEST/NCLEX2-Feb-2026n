    "correct": "Administering oxygen is crucial in the setting of an MI to increase oxygen delivery to the ischemic myocardium, minimizing further damage. Following oxygen administration, the nurse should administer sublingual nitroglycerin to dilate the coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the heart and reducing chest pain. Both interventions work synergistically to improve myocardial oxygen supply and reduce myocardial workload.",
    "incorrect": "Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is essential but is already completed per the scenario. It does not address immediate oxygenation or pain management. Administering morphine is a valid intervention for pain management but follows oxygen and nitroglycerin in the initial sequence. Starting an IV is important for medication administration but is not the priority over oxygenation and pain relief. Placing the patient on continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for detecting arrhythmias but should be done concurrently with, not before, initial interventions.",
