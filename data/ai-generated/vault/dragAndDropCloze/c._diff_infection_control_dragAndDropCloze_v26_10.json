  "stem": "A patient diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is being admitted to the medical unit. To prevent the spread of infection, the nurse should first {{blank1}} and then {{blank2}}. Consider the patient's current condition, the infectious nature of C. diff, and hospital protocols for infection control. Prioritize actions that directly prevent the spread of the bacteria to other patients and healthcare staff. The nurse must act swiftly and decisively to mitigate the risk of transmission. Furthermore, remember that C. diff spores are highly resilient, necessitating specific measures to eliminate them effectively. Think about the importance of hand hygiene, environmental disinfection, and personal protective equipment (PPE) in controlling the spread of this infection. What immediate steps are most appropriate for preventing the dissemination of C. diff within the healthcare setting? Focus on interventions that are both evidence-based and practical in a busy medical unit environment. Effective infection control requires a multifaceted approach, combining both individual and environmental measures. The nurse should be knowledgeable and proactive in implementing these strategies. What specific actions will have the most significant impact on preventing the spread of C. diff in this scenario?",

    "correct": "Initiating contact precautions and donning appropriate PPE, such as a gown and gloves, is crucial in preventing the spread of C. difficile. Thorough handwashing with soap and water, rather than alcohol-based hand sanitizers, is essential to remove C. difficile spores effectively. This combined approach minimizes the risk of transmission to other patients and healthcare personnel.",
    "incorrect": "Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer is ineffective against C. difficile spores. Immediately administering antibiotics would not be the first action, as this would be a medical intervention, and isolation should be prioritized. Transferring to a negative pressure room is not always necessary unless there is a risk of airborne transmission, which is not the primary concern with C. difficile. Using bleach wipes is important, but donning PPE and isolating are higher priorities.",
