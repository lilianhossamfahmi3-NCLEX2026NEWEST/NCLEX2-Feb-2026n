        "correct": "The Tensilon (Edrophonium) test helps differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crises. Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increasing acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. In a myasthenic crisis (under-medication), the increased ACh temporarily improves muscle strength. In a cholinergic crisis (over-medication), excessive ACh leads to overstimulation of muscarinic receptors, worsening muscle weakness and causing SLUDGE symptoms (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI upset, Emesis). Atropine is the antidote for cholinergic crisis.",
        "incorrect": "Atropine is the antidote for a cholinergic crisis, not a myasthenic crisis. The Tensilon test is a diagnostic aid, not a definitive diagnosis for Myasthenia Gravis. Other tests, such as ACh receptor antibody tests, are also used.",

            "Always have resuscitation equipment, including suction and oxygen, and Atropine readily available during a Tensilon test. Monitor vital signs closely.",

Last dose 0800. Noted increased difficulty swallowing and ptosis.\nAssessment: Weakness improved after Tensilon test. HR 90, BP 130/80, RR 24 with shallow breaths. Excessive salivation noted. ABGs pending.\nRecommendation: Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Hold next dose of pyridostigmine. Prepare for possible intubation if respiratory distress worsens. Administer Atropine if cholinergic symptoms increase. Obtain serial ABGs. Notify provider of results and plan of care."
