    "correct": "Paresthesia, characterized by numbness and tingling, arises from demyelination of sensory nerves in MS, disrupting normal signal transmission. Lhermitte's sign, an electric-shock sensation down the spine upon neck flexion, indicates demyelination of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. These are common early indicators of MS due to the inflammatory and demyelinating processes affecting the central nervous system. Romberg's sign assesses balance and proprioception, and while balance issues can occur in MS, it's less specific than paresthesia and Lhermitte's sign for early diagnosis.",
    "incorrect": "Babinski's sign, indicated by dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of other toes, suggests upper motor neuron damage, which can be present in MS but is not a primary early symptom. Kernig's sign, resistance to knee extension when the hip is flexed, is indicative of meningeal irritation, unrelated to the pathophysiology of MS.",

No recent changes in medication. 0810: Neurological assessment reveals decreased sensation to light touch in lower extremities. Gait is slightly unsteady. 0815: Recommend neurology consult for possible exacerbation and adjustment of treatment plan."
