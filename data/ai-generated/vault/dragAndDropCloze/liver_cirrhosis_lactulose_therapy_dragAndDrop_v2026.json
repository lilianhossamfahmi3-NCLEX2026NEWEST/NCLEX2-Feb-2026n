Patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, admitted for hepatic encephalopathy. \n1415: Patient is oriented to person only, confused to place and time. Asterixis noted. Abdomen is distended. Bowel sounds hypoactive in all four quadrants. \n1430: Noted patient had one episode of watery stool this morning. Skin turgor is poor. Mucous membranes are dry. \n1445: Lactulose 30 mL PO administered per order. Encouraged oral fluids. Will continue to monitor mental status and bowel movements. \n1500: Patient remains confused but is resting comfortably. Will reassess in one hour. Continue monitoring for further changes in condition. Education provided to family regarding lactulose and its purpose."
