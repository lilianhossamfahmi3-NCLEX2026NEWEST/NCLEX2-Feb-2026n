    "correct": "In a tension pneumothorax, air accumulates in the pleural space without any means of escape, leading to a rapid increase in intrathoracic pressure. This increased pressure causes the mediastinum, which houses the heart, great vessels, and trachea, to shift towards the unaffected side (mediastinal shift). The trachea is also pushed away from the affected side (tracheal deviation). This shift compresses the heart and great vessels, impairing venous return and cardiac output, resulting in severe hypotension and shock.",
    "incorrect": "Hyperresonance may be present in both simple and tension pneumothoraces due to the presence of air in the pleural space, but it is not specific to tension pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema (air under the skin) can occur in both conditions if there is a disruption in the lung tissue or chest wall, but it is not a primary differentiating factor. Bradypnea (slow breathing) is not a typical finding; patients often exhibit tachypnea (rapid breathing) as they struggle to compensate for impaired gas exchange.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Immediate treatment for tension pneumothorax is needle decompression (14-16 gauge needle inserted into the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line) to relieve pressure, followed by chest tube placement for definitive management. Monitor vital signs closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Provide supplemental oxygen and prepare for potential complications such as cardiac arrest.",
      "SBAR Example (140 words, military time):\nSituation: Pt is experiencing acute respiratory distress.\nBackground: Pt w/ hx of COPD developed sudden chest pain & SOB. O2 sat 82% on RA. Absent breath sounds on the right.\nAssessment: Suspect tension pneumothorax. Trachea deviated to the left. HR 140, BP 90/60. Pt is anxious and diaphoretic.\nRecommendation: STAT chest x-ray to confirm. Prepare for immediate needle decompression at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line on the right. Gather supplies for chest tube insertion. Notify attending physician immediately. Monitor vital signs q5min. Administer high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask. Anticipate potential need for vasopressors to support blood pressure. Consider arterial blood gas analysis to assess acid-base balance. Provide emotional support to the patient and family. 0800: Notified attending physician. 0805: Chest x-ray ordered. 0810: Supplies gathered for needle decompression. 0815: Waiting for physician to arrive for procedure."
