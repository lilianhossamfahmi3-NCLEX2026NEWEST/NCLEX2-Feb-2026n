In contrast, hypertonic solutions have a higher osmolality than plasma, drawing fluid from the intracellular and interstitial spaces into the intravascular space. This increases vascular volume and can dehydrate cells. Examples include 3% Normal Saline.",

Understanding fluid tonicity is crucial for selecting the appropriate solution to achieve the desired fluid shift.\nBackground: The patient's current condition necessitates either cellular hydration or vascular volume expansion. Assessment data includes serum electrolyte levels, hydration status, urine output, and relevant medical history.\nAssessment: Based on the patient's assessment, a hypotonic or hypertonic solution is indicated to shift fluid appropriately. Incorrect fluid selection could exacerbate the patient's condition, leading to complications such as cerebral edema or fluid overload.\nRecommendation: Administer the selected IV fluid (either hypotonic or hypertonic) as prescribed, closely monitoring the patient's fluid balance, electrolyte levels, neurological status, and vital signs. Document all interventions and patient responses in the electronic health record. Notify the provider immediately of any adverse reactions or unexpected changes in the patient's condition."
