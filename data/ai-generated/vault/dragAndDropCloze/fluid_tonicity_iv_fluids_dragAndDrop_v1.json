    "correct": "Hypotonic solutions have a lower osmolality than plasma, causing fluid to shift from the intravascular space into the intracellular space, hydrating the cells. In contrast, hypertonic solutions have a higher osmolality than plasma, drawing fluid from the intracellular and interstitial spaces into the intravascular space. This increases vascular volume and can dehydrate cells.",
    "incorrect": "Isotonic solutions have a similar osmolality to plasma and primarily expand the intravascular volume without causing significant fluid shifts between compartments. Colloid solutions contain large molecules that remain in the intravascular space, increasing oncotic pressure and drawing fluid into the vascular space.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Use hypertonic solutions cautiously in patients with heart failure or renal insufficiency due to the risk of fluid overload. Monitor neurological status closely when administering hypertonic saline for hyponatremia to prevent rapid correction and osmotic demyelination syndrome.",
