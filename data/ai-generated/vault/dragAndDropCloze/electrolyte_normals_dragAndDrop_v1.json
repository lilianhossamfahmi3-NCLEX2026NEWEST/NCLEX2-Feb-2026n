        "correct": "Hypocalcemia (low Calcium) increases neuromuscular excitability due to a reduction in the threshold potential of nerve and muscle cells. This leads to spontaneous firing of action potentials, resulting in muscle tetany and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs. Hypokalemia (low Potassium) causes hyperpolarization of cell membranes, making them less responsive to stimuli. This impairs muscle contraction, leading to muscle weakness. The flattened T-waves on an ECG are due to delayed repolarization of the ventricles.",
        "incorrect": "Magnesium deficiency can cause neuromuscular excitability, but Chvostek's sign is more specific to hypocalcemia. Sodium imbalances primarily affect fluid balance and neurological function, leading to altered mental status and seizures. Phosphorus imbalances are often related to calcium imbalances but do not directly cause the specific signs mentioned in the stem.",

            "Chvostek's sign: Tap the facial nerve anterior to the ear; facial twitching indicates hypocalcemia. Trousseau's sign: Inflate a BP cuff above systolic pressure for 3 minutes; carpal spasm indicates hypocalcemia. Always assess electrolytes in conjunction with other labs (e.g., albumin for calcium)."

ECG shows flattened T-waves. Current lab results are pending. Vital signs: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air.\nRecommendation: 1. STAT electrolyte panel including Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, Sodium, and Phosphorus. 2. Cardiac monitoring for dysrhythmias. 3. Notify provider with lab results. 4. Implement safety precautions due to risk of seizures and falls. 5. Anticipate potential need for electrolyte replacement based on lab values."
