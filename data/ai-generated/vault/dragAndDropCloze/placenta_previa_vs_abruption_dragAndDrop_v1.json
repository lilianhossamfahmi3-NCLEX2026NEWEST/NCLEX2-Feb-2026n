    "correct": "Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants over or near the cervical os, leading to painless, bright red vaginal bleeding, especially in the third trimester as the lower uterine segment thins and the cervix dilates. Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, resulting in dark red vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and a rigid abdomen due to blood accumulation. Bleeding can be concealed or revealed.",
    "incorrect": {
      "Placenta Previa": "Ectopic pregnancy typically presents with unilateral abdominal pain and spotting in the first trimester, not painless, bright red bleeding in the third trimester. Threatened abortion involves cervical os closing and bleeding in early pregnancy, not the third trimester. These are not the primary differentiating factors between placenta previa and placental abruption.",
      "Placental Abruption": "Ectopic pregnancy typically presents with unilateral abdominal pain and spotting in the first trimester, not dark red bleeding and a rigid, painful abdomen in the third trimester. Threatened abortion involves cervical os closing and bleeding in early pregnancy, not the third trimester. These are not the primary differentiating factors between placenta previa and placental abruption."
