    "correct": "Potassium (K+) is the major intracellular cation crucial for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and maintaining cardiac rhythms. A normal range of 3.5-5.0 mEq/L is essential for these functions. Magnesium (Mg2+) plays a vital role in neuromuscular excitability, enzyme reactions, and protein synthesis. A normal range of 1.3-2.1 mEq/L is critical for maintaining these processes.",
    "incorrect": "Sodium (Na+) is the primary extracellular cation, regulating fluid balance and nerve impulse transmission; its normal range is 135-145 mEq/L. Calcium (Ca2+) is essential for bone health, blood clotting, and muscle contraction; its normal range is 9.0-10.5 mg/dL. Phosphorus (PO43-) is involved in energy production and bone formation; its normal range is 3.0-4.5 mg/dL.",
