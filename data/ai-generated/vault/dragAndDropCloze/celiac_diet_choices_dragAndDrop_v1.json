Ingesting gluten causes inflammation and damage to the small intestine's villi, impairing nutrient absorption. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is crucial for managing the disease and preventing long-term complications. Wheat bread contains gluten and must be avoided. Rice is a naturally gluten-free grain and a safe alternative.",

The parents need education on appropriate food choices.\nBackground: The child was diagnosed with Celiac disease 6 months ago and has experienced intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea. The child's growth has been slightly below the 25th percentile.\nAssessment: The child is now asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet. The parents demonstrate some understanding of the diet but require further clarification on specific food choices. Vital signs are stable.\nRecommendation: Provide the parents with a list of gluten-free foods and foods to avoid. Emphasize the importance of reading food labels carefully. Recommend a follow-up appointment with a registered dietitian for ongoing support and education. Ensure the parents understand the need for strict adherence to the gluten-free diet to prevent future complications. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician in 2 weeks to assess the child's growth and overall well-being."
