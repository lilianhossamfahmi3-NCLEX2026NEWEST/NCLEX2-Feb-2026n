A small amount of slough is present. 0730: Vitals stable: Temp 37.2°C, HR 88 bpm, BP 120/80 mmHg, RR 18. Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. 0745: Pt repositioned to left lateral decubitus. Skin barrier cream applied to surrounding tissue. Wound care consult requested. 0800: Educated Pt on the importance of frequent repositioning and pressure relief. Continue to monitor the wound and implement prescribed interventions. Notified provider of findings and awaiting further orders."
