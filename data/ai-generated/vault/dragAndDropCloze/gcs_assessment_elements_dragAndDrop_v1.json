Each category is scored, and the scores are summed to provide a total GCS score. In this case, the client opens eyes to pain (2), is confused (4), and localizes pain (5). Therefore, the total GCS score is 2 + 4 + 5 = 11. A GCS score of 11 indicates impaired neurological function and requires ongoing monitoring and potential intervention to prevent further deterioration.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   **15:** A GCS score of 15 represents a fully alert and oriented individual. This is incorrect because the client exhibits impaired responses.\n*   **3:** A GCS score of 3 is the lowest possible score, indicating deep unconsciousness. This is incorrect because the client exhibits some response to stimuli.\n*   **8:** A GCS score of 8 or less typically indicates a comatose state and often necessitates intubation to protect the airway. This is incorrect because the client's score is higher than 8. \n*   **7:** A GCS score of 7 indicates a severe brain injury. This is incorrect because the client's score is higher than 7.",
