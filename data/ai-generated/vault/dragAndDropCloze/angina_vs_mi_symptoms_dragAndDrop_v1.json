  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Stable angina is caused by transient myocardial ischemia, often due to exertion or stress, resulting from narrowed coronary arteries. The pain is typically relieved within minutes by rest or nitroglycerin, which dilates coronary arteries, increasing blood flow. Myocardial infarction (MI) involves prolonged ischemia leading to irreversible myocardial cell death (necrosis). This is usually caused by a complete or near-complete occlusion of a coronary artery by a thrombus, often formed on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. The pain is severe, persistent (lasting longer than 20-30 minutes), and unresponsive to rest or nitroglycerin. Diaphoresis occurs due to the body's stress response and activation of the sympathetic nervous system.",
    "incorrect": "Unstable angina also resists nitroglycerin initially, but the diaphoresis and prolonged nature of the pain strongly suggest myocardial infarction. Unstable angina is a state between stable angina and MI, where plaque disruption and thrombus formation occur, but without complete occlusion or significant myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis causes chest pain that is often sharp and pleuritic, worsened by breathing or lying down, and may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Heart failure can cause chest pain due to increased myocardial oxygen demand, but it is typically associated with shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Instruct clients to call 911 immediately if chest pain persists or worsens 5 minutes after taking the first dose of nitroglycerin. Time is muscle!",
      "Educate patients with angina about the importance of adhering to their medication regimen, including taking nitroglycerin prophylactically before activities known to trigger angina.",
      "Assess vital signs frequently, including blood pressure and heart rate, during episodes of chest pain. Hypotension can exacerbate ischemia, while tachycardia increases myocardial oxygen demand."

      "trap": "Relief with Nitro",
      "howToOvercome": "If the pain is consistently relieved with rest or nitroglycerin, it's likely stable angina. If the pain is new, worsening, or unrelieved by nitroglycerin, treat it as a potential MI until proven otherwise. Obtain an ECG immediately to assess for ST-segment elevation or depression."
