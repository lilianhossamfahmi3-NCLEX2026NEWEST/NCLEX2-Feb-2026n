  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a syndrome of massive imbalanced reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in individuals with SCI at T6 or above. The noxious stimuli (e.g., bladder distention, bowel impaction) triggers an exaggerated sympathetic response below the level of the lesion, leading to vasoconstriction and a rapid rise in blood pressure. Baroreceptors detect the hypertension and attempt to compensate by triggering vasodilation above the level of the injury, resulting in flushing and diaphoresis. The body is unable to regulate the sympathetic response below the level of injury due to the spinal cord lesion.",
    "incorrect": [
      "Pitting edema is not a typical acute manifestation of autonomic dysreflexia. It may indicate fluid overload or venous insufficiency, but it's not directly related to the autonomic nervous system response in AD.",
      "Muscle spasticity is a common finding in SCI but is not a direct result of the acute autonomic dysreflexia episode. It's a chronic condition related to upper motor neuron damage.",
      "The body's compensatory mechanisms cause vasodilation above the level of injury, leading to flushing and diaphoresis, not vasoconstriction and coolness."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "The most common triggers for AD are bladder distention, bowel impaction, and skin breakdown. Prompt identification and removal of the trigger are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.",
      "Monitor BP every 3-5 minutes during an AD episode. Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to promote orthostatic hypotension and reduce BP.",
      "Administer antihypertensive medications as prescribed (e.g., hydralazine, nifedipine) if non-pharmacological interventions are ineffective."

      "recommendation": "Immediately elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees. Assess for and relieve the triggering stimulus (e.g., bladder distention, bowel impaction). Monitor BP every 3-5 minutes. Administer antihypertensive medication as prescribed if BP remains elevated. Notify the provider if symptoms persist or worsen. Document interventions and client response. Consider urinary catheterization if bladder distention is suspected. Check for bowel impaction and administer a bowel program as needed. Educate the client and family on the signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and preventive measures."
