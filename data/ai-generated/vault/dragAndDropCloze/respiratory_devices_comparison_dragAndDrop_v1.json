    "correct": "The incentive spirometer promotes deep, sustained inspiration, increasing transpulmonary pressure and reinflating collapsed alveoli (atelectasis). Post-operative patients are at high risk for atelectasis due to anesthesia, pain, and decreased mobility. The peak flow meter measures the maximum rate of airflow during forced expiration. It helps asthmatics monitor airway obstruction and detect early signs of worsening asthma, allowing for timely intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Nebulizers deliver aerosolized medication to the lungs, not primarily for lung expansion or airflow monitoring. CPAP provides continuous positive airway pressure to keep airways open, typically used for sleep apnea or respiratory distress, not routine post-operative atelectasis prevention or asthma monitoring.",

      "Instruct clients to use the incentive spirometer 10 times every hour while awake. Encourage slow, deep breaths, holding each breath for 3-5 seconds.",
