    "correct": "Initiating airborne precautions immediately is crucial to prevent the spread of TB to other patients and staff. Placing the patient in a negative pressure room and ensuring staff wear N95 respirators are essential steps. Obtaining sputum specimens confirms the diagnosis and guides treatment. Administering antitubercular medications is important but secondary to containing the infection. Providing emotional support is always valuable but less urgent than infection control measures.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying airborne precautions risks exposing others to TB. Obtaining sputum specimens is essential for diagnosis but follows the establishment of isolation. Administering medications and providing emotional support are important but not the immediate priority. Failing to place the patient in a negative pressure room and use appropriate respiratory protection defeats the purpose of airborne precautions. Emotional support should be provided after initial safety measures are addressed.",
