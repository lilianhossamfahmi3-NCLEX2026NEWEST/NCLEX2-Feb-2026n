            "correct": "Afterload is the resistance the left ventricle must overcome to circulate blood. Elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) directly increases afterload, making it harder for the heart to eject blood effectively. In this case, the arterial line data indicates a high SVR, confirming increased afterload. Preload is the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. A high CVP of 18 mmHg suggests high right atrial pressure, indicative of fluid overload, which increases preload. Cardiac output (CO) is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute. A CO of 3.5 L/min is low, suggesting compromised contractility, reducing the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.",

He reports increasing shortness of breath and appears anxious.\n**07:00 Background:** The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. He admits to being non-compliant with his medication regimen. He was admitted with dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Initial BNP was 1200 pg/mL.\n**07:00 Assessment:** The patient is alert and oriented but exhibits labored breathing. His heart rate is 110 bpm, blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min and labored, and SpO2 is 88% on room air. Coarse crackles are auscultated bilaterally. CVP is 18 mmHg. Arterial line shows SVR of 1800 dynes/sec/cm-5. Cardiac Output is 3.5 L/min. Oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L was initiated.\n**07:00 Recommendation:** I recommend increasing the oxygen to a non-rebreather mask, administering IV furosemide 40 mg STAT, and considering an arterial blood gas to assess respiratory status. Closely monitor hemodynamic status. Consider afterload reduction therapy if the patient's blood pressure remains elevated.",
