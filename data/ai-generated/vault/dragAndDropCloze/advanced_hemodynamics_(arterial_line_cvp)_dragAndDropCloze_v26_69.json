      "correct": "Afterload is the resistance the left ventricle must overcome to circulate blood. Elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) directly increases afterload, making it harder for the heart to eject blood. Preload is the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. High preload indicates fluid overload, stretching the myocardial fibers. Cardiac output (CO) is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute. Compromised contractility reduces the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to a low cardiac output and subsequently inadequate tissue perfusion.",

      "SBAR": "**07:00 Situation:** Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old male admitted yesterday with acute decompensated heart failure. He's increasingly short of breath and appears anxious.\n**07:00 Background:** Patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. He has been non-compliant with his medication regimen. Admitted with dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Initial BNP was 1200 pg/mL.\n**07:00 Assessment:** Patient is alert and oriented, but labored breathing. HR 110 bpm, BP 160/90 mmHg, RR 28 breaths/min and labored, SpO2 88% on room air. Coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. CVP is 18 mmHg. Arterial line shows SVR of 1800 dynes/sec/cm-5. Cardiac Output is 3.5 L/min. Pt started on oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L.\n**07:00 Recommendation:** I recommend increasing the oxygen to a non-rebreather mask, administering IV furosemide 40 mg STAT, and considering arterial blood gas to assess respiratory status. Monitor hemodynamic status closely. Possible need for afterload reduction therapy.",
