It increases cardiac contractility but has a narrow therapeutic window. The therapeutic range for Phenytoin (Dilantin) is 10-20 mcg/mL. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant used to control seizures. Maintaining levels within this range is crucial to prevent seizures while avoiding toxicity.",

Current medications include Digoxin 0.125 mg daily and Phenytoin 100 mg three times daily.\nAssessment: The patient's serum Digoxin level is 0.6 ng/mL and Phenytoin level is 8 mcg/mL. The patient denies any adverse effects. Vital signs: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 60 bpm, RR 16, Temp 98.6°F (37°C). At 1400, the lab results were received.\nRecommendation: The healthcare provider should be notified of the subtherapeutic Digoxin and Phenytoin levels. Consider increasing the Digoxin and Phenytoin dosages per provider orders, while closely monitoring for signs of toxicity. Repeat serum drug levels should be drawn after dosage adjustments to ensure therapeutic levels are achieved. Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and potential side effects."
