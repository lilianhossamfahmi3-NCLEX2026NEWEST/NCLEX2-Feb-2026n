    "correct": "Hypoglycemia is characterized by neuroglycopenic symptoms like diaphoresis, tremors, and confusion due to insufficient glucose reaching the brain. The body activates the sympathetic nervous system to release counter-regulatory hormones (epinephrine, glucagon) to raise blood glucose, leading to sweating and tremors. Hyperglycemia, specifically DKA, presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and fruity breath. Polyuria and polydipsia occur due to osmotic diuresis as the kidneys try to excrete excess glucose. Fruity breath is caused by the presence of ketones, a byproduct of fat metabolism when the body lacks sufficient insulin to use glucose for energy. Kussmaul respirations (deep, rapid breathing) are also common in DKA as the body attempts to compensate for metabolic acidosis by blowing off excess carbon dioxide.",
    "incorrect": "HHS typically does NOT have the fruity breath or ketones associated with DKA. HHS involves severe hyperglycemia and dehydration without significant ketoacidosis. Diabetes Insipidus is related to ADH and fluid balance, not glucose metabolism.",
