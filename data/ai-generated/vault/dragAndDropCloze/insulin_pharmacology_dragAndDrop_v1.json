        "correct": "Regular insulin (Humulin R) is a short-acting insulin with an onset of action within 30 minutes and a peak effect occurring 2-4 hours after subcutaneous administration. This peak time is crucial for monitoring for potential hypoglycemia. Insulin Glargine (Lantus) is a long-acting insulin analog that provides a relatively constant level of insulin over 24 hours, minimizing the risk of pronounced peaks and troughs in blood glucose levels. Its mechanism involves slow release from the injection site, leading to prolonged action.",
        "incorrect": "NPH insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin with a peak effect occurring 4-12 hours after administration. Rapid-acting insulins like Lispro (Humalog) and Aspart (Novolog) have a much faster onset and peak within 30-90 minutes. Selecting these options indicates a misunderstanding of insulin pharmacokinetics and duration of action.",
