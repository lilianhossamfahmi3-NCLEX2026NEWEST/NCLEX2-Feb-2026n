Oxygen saturation 92% on room air. 0900: Patient reports adhering to prescribed diet, but states family brought takeout last night. 1000: Notified provider of changes in patient condition. Orders received to monitor I&O, daily weights, and restrict sodium intake to 2 grams per day. 1100: Educated patient on importance of fluid and sodium restriction. Encouraged patient to verbalize understanding. 1200: Continued to monitor patient's respiratory status and edema. Notified dietary of the need for a renal diet. 1300: Patient denies any chest pain. Patient is resting comfortably at this time. Edema is noted to be +2 bilaterally. Patient states they are thirsty. Will continue to monitor."
