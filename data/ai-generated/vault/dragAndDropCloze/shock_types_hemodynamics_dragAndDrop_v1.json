    "correct": "Neurogenic shock is a distributive type of shock resulting from a loss of sympathetic tone, often due to spinal cord injury. This leads to massive vasodilation, causing warm, dry skin due to decreased peripheral resistance. The unopposed vagal tone results in bradycardia. Anaphylactic shock is a severe hypersensitivity reaction causing systemic vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and bronchoconstriction. Stridor and wheezing indicate upper and lower airway obstruction, respectively, while hypotension results from widespread vasodilation and fluid shift into the interstitial space.",
    "incorrect": "Hypovolemic shock typically presents with tachycardia as the body attempts to compensate for decreased circulating volume. Septic shock usually involves tachycardia and fever, along with signs of infection. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by cool, clammy skin due to decreased cardiac output and compensatory vasoconstriction.",
