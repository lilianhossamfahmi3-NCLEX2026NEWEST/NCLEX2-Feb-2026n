This position reduces pressure on the diaphragm, allowing for deeper and more comfortable respirations. Impaired gas exchange can occur if the client is lying flat.\n\n2. **Valsalva Maneuver:** Instructing the client to perform the Valsalva maneuver (bearing down against a closed glottis) increases intrathoracic pressure. This elevated pressure helps to prevent air from being drawn into the pleural space during chest tube removal, reducing the risk of a pneumothorax. The positive pressure exerted during Valsalva exceeds the atmospheric pressure, effectively sealing the pleural space as the tube is withdrawn.\n\n3. **Occlusive Dressing:** Immediately applying an occlusive dressing (typically petroleum-based gauze covered by a sterile dressing) creates an airtight seal over the insertion site. This prevents atmospheric air from entering the pleural space, further minimizing the risk of pneumothorax. The occlusive dressing maintains negative pressure within the pleural space, which is essential for lung inflation.",
      "incorrect": "* **Prone:** Placing the client in a prone position is contraindicated as it restricts lung expansion and makes it difficult for the client to breathe effectively.\n* **Deep Breath:** Instructing the client to take a deep breath *without* performing the Valsalva maneuver can actually decrease intrathoracic pressure, potentially leading to air being drawn into the pleural space and causing a pneumothorax. The negative pressure created by inhalation can exacerbate the risk of air entry.\n* **Dry Gauze:** Applying dry gauze is insufficient as it is porous and does not create an airtight seal.

The nurse must perform hand hygiene before donning sterile gloves.\n3. **Chlorhexidine:** Chlorhexidine is the preferred antiseptic for skin antisepsis due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and residual effect. The back-and-forth friction motion mechanically removes debris and microorganisms from the skin. Allowing the chlorhexidine to air dry completely is critical for its efficacy. The drying time allows the antiseptic to effectively kill microorganisms on the skin surface.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** CLABSIs occur when microorganisms enter the bloodstream through the central venous catheter.
