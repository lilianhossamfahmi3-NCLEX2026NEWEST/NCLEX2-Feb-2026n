        "correct": "Cloudy peritoneal outflow is a hallmark sign of peritonitis, a serious infection of the peritoneal cavity. The cloudiness is due to an increased number of white blood cells fighting the infection. Insufficient outflow can be caused by catheter kinking, constipation, or the catheter tip being displaced against the abdominal wall or omentum. Changing positions, such as rolling from side to side, can help reposition the catheter and improve drainage. 1400: Assess the effluent. 1405: Reposition the client. 1410: Document the findings.",
