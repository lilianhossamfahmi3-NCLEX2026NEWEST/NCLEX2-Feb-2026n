    "correct": "**Diverticulosis:** Asymptomatic condition with small pouches (diverticula) in the colon. A high-fiber diet increases stool bulk, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation, which reduces pressure on the colon walls and the risk of diverticula formation or inflammation. **Diverticulitis:** Inflammation or infection of the diverticula. A clear liquid or NPO diet provides bowel rest, reducing stimulation of the inflamed colon and allowing it to heal. This minimizes further irritation and the risk of complications like perforation or abscess formation.",
