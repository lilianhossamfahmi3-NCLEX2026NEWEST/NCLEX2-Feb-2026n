  "stem": "A patient in the ICU has an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring and is being treated for pneumonia. The nurse observes that the arterial waveform is dampened. The blood pressure readings are trending lower than previous readings. The patient's lungs sound coarse bilaterally, and they are alert and oriented. The nurse reviews the patient's chart, noting the medications administered and recent lab results. Considering the potential causes of a dampened arterial waveform in the context of pneumonia and critical care, the nurse should FIRST {{blank1}}, and then {{blank2}} to troubleshoot the issue and ensure accurate blood pressure monitoring, which is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This situation requires a systematic approach to identify and address the underlying cause of the dampened waveform while considering the patient's overall clinical status and treatment plan. Addressing this issue promptly is essential to prevent any delays in appropriate interventions and to maintain the patient's hemodynamic stability in the ICU setting. Proper assessment and intervention are key to optimal patient outcomes.",

    "correct": "A dampened arterial waveform indicates a decrease in the dynamic response of the arterial line system, which can lead to inaccurate readings, particularly underestimation of systolic pressure and overestimation of diastolic pressure. The FIRST action is to assess the patient and system to rule out any physiological causes or kinks in the tubing. After assessing the patient and ruling out any obvious issues, the nurse should then flush the arterial line to clear any potential clots or air bubbles that may be contributing to the dampened waveform.",
    "incorrect": "Zeroing the transducer is important for accurate readings, but it's not the first step when a dampened waveform is observed. It addresses calibration issues, not mechanical obstructions. Increasing the infusion rate of the flush solution is not the primary intervention for a dampened waveform. While it might help clear a small clot, it doesn't address the underlying cause. Calling the physician immediately is not necessary as the nurse can troubleshoot dampened arterial waveforms.",
