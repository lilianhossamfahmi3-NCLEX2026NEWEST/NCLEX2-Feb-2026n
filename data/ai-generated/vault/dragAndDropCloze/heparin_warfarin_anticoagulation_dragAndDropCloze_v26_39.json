The patient's aPTT is 90 seconds (therapeutic range 60-80 seconds) and INR is 1.2 (therapeutic range 2.0-3.0).

        "correct": "The patient's aPTT is elevated above the therapeutic range, indicating that the heparin is having too strong of an effect. The heparin infusion should be decreased to prevent bleeding complications. The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, indicating that the warfarin is not yet effective. The warfarin dosage should be increased to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. Overlap is needed because warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing the heparin would further elevate the aPTT and increase the risk of bleeding. Decreasing the warfarin dosage would further reduce the INR and delay therapeutic anticoagulation. Discontinuing heparin when INR is subtherapeutic increases risk of clot extension. Maintaining current doses would not correct the lab abnormalities.",
