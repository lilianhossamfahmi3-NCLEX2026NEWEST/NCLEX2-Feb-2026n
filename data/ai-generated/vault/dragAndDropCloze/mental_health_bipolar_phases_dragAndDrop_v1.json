        "correct": "The client exhibiting grandiosity, flight of ideas, and insomnia is experiencing a manic episode. Mania is characterized by an abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, accompanied by persistent increased activity or energy. Physiologically, mania is associated with neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly elevated levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain. The client reporting anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) and feelings of worthlessness is experiencing a depressive episode. Depression involves decreased levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, leading to symptoms such as sadness, fatigue, and impaired cognitive function.",
        "incorrect": "Hypomania is a milder form of mania, lacking the marked impairment in social or occupational functioning and psychotic features seen in mania. Euthymic refers to a normal and stable mood state, absent of manic or depressive symptoms.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "During acute mania, prioritize client safety by reducing environmental stimuli and monitoring for exhaustion. Provide high-calorie finger foods to address nutritional needs, as clients may be too active to sit down for meals. Administer medications as prescribed to stabilize mood.",
            "In depressive episodes, encourage participation in activities to combat anhedonia, monitor for suicidal ideation, and provide a supportive environment.",
            "SBAR Example (140 words, military time):\n\n**Situation:** I'm calling about John Doe, a 32-year-old male admitted for Bipolar I Disorder, currently exhibiting manic symptoms.\n\n**Background:** Mr. Doe was admitted three days ago after being found running naked through a park, claiming to be a superhero. He has a history of Bipolar I Disorder, non-compliant with medication.\n\n**Assessment:** Currently, at 1400, Mr. Doe is pacing rapidly, exhibiting pressured speech, and flight of ideas. He reports feeling invincible and refuses to take his medication. He hasn't slept in 72 hours and has only consumed minimal amounts of food. Vital signs: HR 120, BP 160/90, RR 24. He is at high risk for exhaustion and potential harm to self or others.\n\n**Recommendation:** I recommend a stat order for IM antipsychotic medication to manage his acute mania and prevent further escalation. I also recommend a consult with the psychiatric team to reassess his medication regimen and address his non-compliance. Continuous monitoring for safety and nutritional support are crucial."
