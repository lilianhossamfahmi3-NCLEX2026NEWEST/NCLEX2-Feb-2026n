    "correct": "The Parkland Formula is used to calculate fluid resuscitation needs in burn patients. The formula is: 4 mL x kg x % TBSA. In this case: 4 mL x 70 kg x 50% = 14,000 mL over 24 hours. Half of this total volume (7,000 mL) should be administered within the first 8 hours from the time of the burn injury, and the remaining half (7,000 mL) over the subsequent 16 hours. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial in burn patients to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and prevent hypovolemic shock. The burn injury causes increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. This fluid loss contributes to hypovolemia and decreased cardiac output. Timely and accurate fluid administration is essential to counteract these effects and support vital organ function.",
    "incorrect": "Calculating the total correctly but dividing it into quarters is incorrect for Parkland. The Parkland formula dictates that half of the calculated fluid volume is administered within the first 8 hours from the time of injury, not divided into smaller increments. Administering too little fluid can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "The 8-hour clock starts at the TIME OF INJURY, not time of arrival at the hospital.",
      "Monitor urine output closely to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Aim for 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr in adults.",

Therefore, the first 8-hour window started at 0700. The nurse must calculate the fluid administration rate based on this time frame, not the arrival time at the burn center."

Continuously monitor vital signs, urine output, and respiratory status. Be prepared to adjust fluid rates based on patient response. Consider intubation if respiratory distress worsens."
