    "correct": "Atropine is an anticholinergic medication used to counteract the effects of excessive acetylcholine. In a cholinergic crisis, the excessive acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leads to bradycardia, increased secretions, and muscle weakness. Atropine will block the acetylcholine receptors, thereby increasing the heart rate and drying secretions.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding pyridostigmine, preparing for intubation, notifying the neurologist, or increasing oxygen flow rate are not the immediate priorities. While intubation may eventually be necessary if respiratory distress worsens, and the neurologist should be informed, addressing the bradycardia with atropine is the priority. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and withholding it will not immediately address the bradycardia. Increasing oxygen flow alone will not counteract the effects of excessive acetylcholine.",
