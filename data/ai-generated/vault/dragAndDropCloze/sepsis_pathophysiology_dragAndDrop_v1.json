        "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition arising from a dysregulated host response to an infection. The initial infection triggers an overwhelming inflammatory response, leading to widespread vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and activation of the coagulation cascade. This results in hypotension, tissue edema, and impaired oxygen delivery to vital organs. Septic shock represents a more severe stage of sepsis characterized by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities. It is defined by persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg and a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation.",
        "incorrect": "SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) is a generalized inflammatory response that can be triggered by infectious or non-infectious causes (e.g., trauma, pancreatitis). While SIRS can precede sepsis, it does not necessarily indicate infection. MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome) represents the end-stage failure of two or more organ systems due to uncontrolled inflammation and impaired tissue perfusion. It is a consequence of prolonged or severe sepsis/septic shock.",

            "Initiate fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (e.g., normal saline, lactated Ringer's) to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion.",
            "If hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation, initiate vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg.",
