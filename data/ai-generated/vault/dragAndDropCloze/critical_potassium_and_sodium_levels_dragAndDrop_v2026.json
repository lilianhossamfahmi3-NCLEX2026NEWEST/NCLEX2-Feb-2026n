Situation: Patient is now complaining of muscle weakness and nausea. Background: History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Gastroenteritis symptoms started 2 days ago. Assessment: Patient is alert and oriented but appears weak. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. Noted peaked T waves on telemetry. Patient reports decreased urine output. Recent lab results show elevated potassium and decreased sodium. Recommendation: STAT electrolyte repletion orders, cardiac monitoring, and provider evaluation for potential medication adjustments due to electrolyte imbalances. Assess current medication list."
