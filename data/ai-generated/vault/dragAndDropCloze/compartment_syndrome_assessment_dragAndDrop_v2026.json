Pain is described as a deep, throbbing ache, unrelieved by prescribed analgesics. \n07:05 B: Patient is a 45-year-old male, post-tibial plateau fracture repair 2 days ago. Cast in place since surgery. No prior history of compartment syndrome. \n07:10 A: Left lower leg appears tense and swollen. Pain is disproportionate to the injury. Distal pulses are present but diminished compared to the right leg. Sensation decreased in the web space between the first and second toes. \n07:15 R: Notify the provider of possible compartment syndrome. Assess pain, pulses, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pressure. Prepare for possible intracompartmental pressure monitoring and surgical intervention if indicated."

    "correct": "Assessing the patient's pain level and characteristics is crucial because pain out of proportion to the injury, especially pain with passive stretching of the muscles within the compartment, is an early and key indicator of compartment syndrome. Compartment pressure exceeding 30 mmHg indicates that the pressure within the muscle compartment is high enough to compromise tissue perfusion, leading to ischemia and potential necrosis. The provider needs to be notified immediately for further evaluation and potential intervention (fasciotomy).",
