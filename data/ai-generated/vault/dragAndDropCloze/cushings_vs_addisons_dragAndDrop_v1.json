    "correct": "Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids (cortisol). This leads to characteristic features like 'moon face' (facial rounding due to fat deposition), truncal obesity (central fat accumulation), hyperglycemia, hypertension, and muscle weakness. Addison's disease, on the other hand, is caused by adrenal insufficiency, resulting in decreased cortisol and aldosterone production. This leads to symptoms like bronze-colored skin (hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH), hypotension (due to decreased aldosterone and sodium retention), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fatigue, and weight loss.",
    "incorrect": {
      "Pheochromocytoma": "Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that causes excessive release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to hypertension, tachycardia, and palpitations. It does not directly affect cortisol or aldosterone levels. Therefore, it does not explain the client's symptoms.",
      "Diabetes Insipidus": "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or resistance to ADH, leading to excessive urination (polyuria) and thirst (polydipsia). It is unrelated to adrenal gland function or cortisol/aldosterone levels. Therefore, it does not explain the client's symptoms."

      "Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening emergency characterized by severe hypotension, dehydration, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. It requires immediate treatment with IV fluids (0.9% normal saline) and IV hydrocortisone (e.g., 100 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion or intermittent injections). Monitor vital signs closely, especially blood pressure and heart rate.",
      "Patients with Cushing's syndrome are at increased risk for infection due to the immunosuppressive effects of excess cortisol. Implement infection control measures, such as frequent hand hygiene and avoiding contact with sick individuals. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, such as fever, cough, or wound drainage.",
      "Educate patients with Addison's disease about the importance of lifelong hormone replacement therapy (e.g., hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone). Teach them how to adjust their medication dosage during times of stress, illness, or surgery. Emphasize the need to wear a medical alert bracelet and carry an emergency hydrocortisone injection kit."

      "howToOvercome": "Focus on the underlying pathophysiology of each condition. Cushing's syndrome involves excess cortisol, which promotes sodium retention and fluid accumulation. Addison's disease involves cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, leading to sodium loss and dehydration. Pay close attention to the specific clinical findings presented in the question stem, such as 'moon face,' 'truncal obesity,' 'bronze-colored skin,' and 'hypotension.'"
