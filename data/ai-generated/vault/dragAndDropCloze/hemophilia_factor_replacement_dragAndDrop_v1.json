    "correct": "Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII, a crucial component of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Without sufficient Factor VIII, the cascade leading to fibrin clot formation is impaired, resulting in prolonged bleeding. Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease) results from a deficiency in Factor IX, another essential factor in the intrinsic pathway. Similar to Factor VIII deficiency, a lack of Factor IX disrupts the coagulation cascade, leading to impaired clot formation and increased bleeding risk.",
    "incorrect": "Factor VII is part of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and is not deficient in Hemophilia A or B. Factor X is a component of the common pathway, involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation, but its deficiency is not characteristic of Hemophilia A or B.",
