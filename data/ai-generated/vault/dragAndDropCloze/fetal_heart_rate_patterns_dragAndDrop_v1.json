    "correct": "**Early Deceleration:** This deceleration mirrors the uterine contraction, with the nadir (lowest point) occurring at the peak of the contraction. This is typically a benign finding caused by fetal head compression, stimulating the vagal nerve and slowing the heart rate. No intervention is usually required. **Variable Deceleration:** This deceleration is characterized by a sudden, abrupt drop in FHR, often 'V' shaped, and can occur at any time in relation to the uterine contraction. The primary cause is umbilical cord compression, which reduces fetal oxygenation. Repositioning the mother is often the first intervention.",
    "incorrect": "**Late Deceleration:** This deceleration begins after the peak of the uterine contraction and recovers after the contraction ends. This indicates uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning the placenta is not delivering enough oxygen to the fetus. This is a concerning sign requiring immediate intervention. **Acceleration:** This is a visually apparent abrupt increase (onset to peak less than 30 seconds) in the FHR above the baseline rate. Accelerations are generally considered a sign of fetal well-being.",
