        "correct": "**Prerenal AKI:** Occurs due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. This hypoperfusion reduces glomerular filtration pressure, leading to a decrease in urine output and a buildup of waste products in the blood. Common causes include dehydration, hemorrhage, heart failure, and shock. The kidneys are structurally normal initially, but prolonged hypoperfusion can lead to intrarenal damage.\n\n**Intrarenal AKI:** Involves direct damage to the kidney tissue itself, specifically the tubules, glomeruli, or interstitium. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a common cause, often resulting from nephrotoxic medications (e.g., aminoglycosides, NSAIDs, contrast dyes) or prolonged ischemia. The damage disrupts the kidney's ability to filter waste and regulate fluid balance.\n\n**SBAR Example (0700):**\n*   **Situation:** Patient experiencing AKI. Creatinine elevated to 2.5 mg/dL from baseline of 1.0 mg/dL.\n*   **Background:** Patient admitted for dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. Received multiple doses of ibuprofen for pain.\n*   **Assessment:** Likely prerenal AKI initially due to dehydration, potentially progressing to intrarenal AKI due to NSAID use. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr.\n*   **Recommendation:** Recommend IV fluids bolus, discontinue ibuprofen, and monitor renal function closely. Consider nephrology consult if creatinine continues to rise.",
        "incorrect": "**Postrenal AKI:** Results from obstruction of urine flow after the kidneys, such as kidney stones, tumors, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This obstruction causes back pressure in the kidneys, leading to impaired function. While 'Postrenal' is an option, the clinical scenarios provided do not describe an obstruction.",
