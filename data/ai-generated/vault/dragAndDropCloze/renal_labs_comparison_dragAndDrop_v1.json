        "correct": "Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism, filtered by the kidneys and excreted in urine. It's a highly specific indicator of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Elevated creatinine almost always indicates impaired kidney function. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is a waste product of protein metabolism. While elevated BUN can suggest kidney dysfunction, it's also influenced by factors like dehydration (leading to increased urea concentration), high-protein diets (increasing urea production), catabolic states, and steroid use (promoting protein breakdown). Therefore, BUN is less specific than creatinine for assessing kidney function.",
        "incorrect": "Potassium is an electrolyte primarily regulated by the kidneys, but its level doesn't directly reflect kidney function in the same way as creatinine or BUN. Urine specific gravity measures the concentration of particles in urine, reflecting the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. While abnormal specific gravity can indicate kidney problems, it's also affected by hydration status and other factors.",

            "A normal creatinine level doesn't always guarantee normal GFR, especially in individuals with low muscle mass (e.g., elderly, cachectic patients). In these cases, GFR estimation is crucial.",
