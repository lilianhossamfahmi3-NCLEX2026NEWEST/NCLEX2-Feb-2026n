Digoxin has been part of her medication regimen for several years. \n07:10 A: Patient reports nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision this morning. Noted new onset bradycardia with a heart rate of 48 bpm on assessment. Potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L. EKG shows signs of AV block. \n07:15 R: I am concerned about potential digoxin toxicity. Recommend holding the next dose of digoxin and notifying the provider for further orders and possible administration of Digibind."
