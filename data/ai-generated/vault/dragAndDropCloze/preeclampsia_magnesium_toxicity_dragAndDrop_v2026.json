Receiving magnesium sulfate at 2 grams/hour per protocol.\n1410: A: Patient is somnolent. Respiratory rate is 10 breaths/min and shallow. Deep tendon reflexes are absent. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. Magnesium level is elevated. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows normal variability. \n1415: R: Suspect magnesium toxicity. Recommend discontinuing magnesium sulfate infusion and administering calcium gluconate per protocol. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status, deep tendon reflexes, and urine output is essential.
