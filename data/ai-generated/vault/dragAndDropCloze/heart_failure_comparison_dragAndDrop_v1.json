    "correct": "Left-sided heart failure (HF) occurs when the left ventricle cannot effectively pump blood to the systemic circulation. This leads to a backup of blood into the pulmonary vasculature, increasing pulmonary hydrostatic pressure. This increased pressure forces fluid into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema and manifesting as crackles and dyspnea. Right-sided HF occurs when the right ventricle cannot effectively pump blood to the pulmonary circulation. This causes a backup of blood into the systemic venous system, increasing systemic venous pressure. This increased pressure leads to fluid accumulation in the tissues, resulting in jugular venous distension (JVD).",
    "incorrect": "Pink frothy sputum is a sign of acute pulmonary edema, a severe complication of left-sided heart failure, but JVD is primarily associated with right-sided heart failure due to systemic venous congestion. Peripheral edema, ascites, and splenomegaly are also associated with right-sided heart failure.",

      "The most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. Managing fluid volume and sodium intake are crucial in both types of heart failure.",

Assessment: Crackles in bilateral lung bases, JVD present, peripheral edema +2. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on room air. Recommendation: Administer oxygen, elevate head of bed, administer diuretic as prescribed, and monitor vital signs closely. Notify provider of changes in condition. Time: 1400."
