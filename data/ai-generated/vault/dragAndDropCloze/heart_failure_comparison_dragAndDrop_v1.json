        "correct": "Left-sided heart failure (HF) occurs when the left ventricle cannot effectively pump blood to the systemic circulation, leading to a backup of blood into the pulmonary vasculature and increased pulmonary hydrostatic pressure. This increased pressure forces fluid into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema, manifesting as crackles and dyspnea. Right-sided HF occurs when the right ventricle cannot effectively pump blood to the pulmonary circulation, causing a backup of blood into the systemic venous system and increased systemic venous pressure. This increased pressure leads to fluid accumulation in the tissues, resulting in jugular venous distension (JVD).",
