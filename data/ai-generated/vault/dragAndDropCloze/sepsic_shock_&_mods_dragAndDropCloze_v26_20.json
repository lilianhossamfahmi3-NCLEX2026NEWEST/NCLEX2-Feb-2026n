            "SBAR": "**Situation (07:00):** Jessica Morrison, a 68-year-old female, admitted two days ago for pneumonia, is showing signs of septic shock. Her blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg, heart rate 122 bpm, respiratory rate 30, SpO2 91% on 2L NC, and temperature 39.5°C. She is increasingly lethargic and confused. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr.\n**Background:** She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with oral medications. The initial pneumonia diagnosis was community-acquired. Blood cultures were drawn on admission and are now positive for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.\n**Assessment (07:05):** The patient is hypotensive and tachycardic despite an initial fluid bolus of 500 mL normal saline given at 06:30. ABG results are pending. Lung sounds reveal diffuse crackles. Her skin is warm and flushed. CVP is low, showing signs of end-organ hypoperfusion.\n**Recommendation (07:10):** I recommend initiating vasopressors to maintain a MAP >65 mmHg. Consider increasing oxygen delivery and obtaining repeat blood cultures. Evaluate for source control measures. Monitor lactate levels and consider central line placement for more accurate fluid management and medication administration.",

            "Norepinephrine": "Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor in septic shock because it primarily stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to potent vasoconstriction. This increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, improving tissue perfusion. It's crucial for maintaining adequate MAP in hypotensive patients. clinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of peripheral ischemia when using norepinephrine. questionTrap: Forgetting to assess the patient's response to norepinephrine can lead to inadequate titration and prolonged hypotension. Mnemonic: 'Norepi Now' for immediate blood pressure support.",
            "Vasopressin": "Vasopressin is often added if the patient remains hypotensive despite norepinephrine and adequate fluid resuscitation. It acts on V1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction independent of adrenergic receptors. This is particularly useful in patients who are less responsive to catecholamines or have depleted vasopressin stores. clinicalPearl: Vasopressin can cause digital ischemia; monitor peripheral perfusion. questionTrap: Relying solely on vasopressin without addressing the underlying cause of hypotension can be detrimental. Mnemonic: 'Vaso-rescue' for refractory hypotension.",
            "Crystalloids": "Crystalloids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's, are the initial fluids of choice for resuscitation in septic shock. They expand intravascular volume, improving cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends administering 30 mL/kg within the first three hours. clinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema. questionTrap: Administering excessive crystalloids without considering the patient's cardiac status can worsen outcomes. Mnemonic: 'Crystals Clear' for initial fluid resuscitation.",
            "Lactate": "Serial lactate measurements are crucial in assessing the effectiveness of resuscitation. Elevated lactate levels indicate anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate tissue oxygenation. A decreasing lactate level suggests improved tissue perfusion and response to treatment. clinicalPearl: A persistently elevated lactate level despite resuscitation efforts may indicate ongoing tissue hypoperfusion or occult ischemia. questionTrap: Ignoring trends in lactate levels can lead to delayed recognition of worsening shock. Mnemonic: 'Lactate Levels Lead' to perfusion assessment.",
            "Antibiotics": "Prompt administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential to target the source of infection and prevent further bacterial proliferation. Blood cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotics, but antibiotic administration should not be delayed if cultures cannot be obtained immediately. The choice of antibiotics should be based on local resistance patterns and the suspected source of infection. clinicalPearl: Always consider local antibiotic resistance patterns when selecting initial antibiotics. questionTrap: Delaying antibiotic administration increases mortality in septic shock. Mnemonic: 'Antibiotics ASAP' for source control.",
            "Source Control": "Identifying and addressing the source of infection is critical to controlling sepsis. This may involve drainage of an abscess, removal of infected hardware, or debridement of necrotic tissue. Failure to control the source can lead to persistent sepsis and poor outcomes. clinicalPearl: Source control should be performed as soon as feasible after hemodynamic stabilization. questionTrap: Focusing solely on antibiotics without addressing the source of infection will likely result in treatment failure. Mnemonic: 'Source Secure' for infection control.",
            "MAP": "Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg is crucial for ensuring adequate organ perfusion in septic shock. This target helps to maintain blood flow to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. Vasopressors are often required to achieve this target. clinicalPearl: Individualize MAP targets based on the patient's baseline blood pressure and comorbidities. questionTrap: Setting an arbitrary MAP target without considering the patient's overall clinical picture can be harmful. Mnemonic: 'MAP Matters' for organ perfusion.",
            "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
