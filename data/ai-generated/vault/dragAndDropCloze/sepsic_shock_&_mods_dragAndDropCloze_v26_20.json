      "SBAR": "**Situation (07:00):** Jessica Morrison, a 68-year-old female, admitted 2 days ago for pneumonia, is showing signs of septic shock. BP is 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 30, SpO2 91% on 2L NC, and temp 39.5°C. She is increasingly lethargic and confused. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. \n**Background:** History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with oral medications. Initial pneumonia diagnosis was community-acquired. Blood cultures were drawn on admission and are now positive for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.\n**Assessment (07:05):** Patient is hypotensive and tachycardic despite initial fluid bolus of 500 mL normal saline given at 06:30. ABG results are pending. Lung sounds reveal diffuse crackles. Skin is warm and flushed. CVP is low. Showing signs of end-organ hypoperfusion.\n**Recommendation:** I recommend initiating vasopressors to maintain MAP >65 mmHg. Consider increasing oxygen delivery and obtain repeat blood cultures. Evaluate for source control measures. Monitor lactate levels and consider central line placement for more accurate fluid management and medication administration.",

    "rationale": {
      "Norepinephrine": "Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor due to its potent vasoconstrictive effects, increasing systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. This helps improve tissue perfusion in septic shock.",
      "Vasopressin": "Vasopressin is often added if the patient remains hypotensive despite norepinephrine and adequate fluid resuscitation. It works by binding to V1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction independent of adrenergic receptors. This can be particularly useful in patients who are less responsive to catecholamines.",
      "Crystalloids": "Crystalloids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's, are the initial fluid of choice for resuscitation in septic shock. They help to expand intravascular volume, thereby improving cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends administering 30 mL/kg within the first three hours.",
      "Lactate": "Serial lactate measurements are crucial in assessing the effectiveness of resuscitation. Elevated lactate levels indicate anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate tissue oxygenation. A decreasing lactate level suggests improved tissue perfusion and response to treatment.",
      "Antibiotics": "Prompt administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential to target the source of infection and prevent further bacterial proliferation. Blood cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotics, but antibiotic administration should not be delayed if cultures cannot be obtained immediately. The choice of antibiotics should be based on local resistance patterns and the suspected source of infection.",
      "Source Control": "Identifying and addressing the source of infection is critical to controlling sepsis. This may involve drainage of an abscess, removal of infected hardware, or debridement of necrotic tissue. Failure to control the source can lead to persistent sepsis and poor outcomes.",
      "MAP": "Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg is crucial for ensuring adequate organ perfusion in septic shock. This target helps to maintain blood flow to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. Vasopressors are often required to achieve this target."

      "Early recognition and aggressive management are key to improving outcomes in septic shock. Follow the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' guidelines.",
      "Fluid resuscitation should be guided by clinical assessment and response. Over-resuscitation can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function.",
      "Consider arterial line placement for continuous blood pressure monitoring in unstable patients.",
      "Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring can be helpful but should not be used in isolation to guide fluid management.",
      "Always consider the possibility of adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock who are refractory to vasopressors."
