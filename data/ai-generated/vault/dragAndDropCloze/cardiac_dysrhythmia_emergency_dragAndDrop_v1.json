    "correct": "Synchronized cardioversion is used for unstable tachyarrhythmias *with* a pulse, such as SVT. The synchronized shock is timed to deliver energy on the R wave, avoiding the vulnerable T wave period and reducing the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic, disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, resulting in no effective cardiac output. Defibrillation delivers an unsynchronized electrical shock to depolarize the entire myocardium, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker to resume normal electrical activity.",
    "incorrect": "Sinus bradycardia is treated with atropine or pacing, not cardioversion or defibrillation. Stable atrial fibrillation is typically managed with rate control medications (e.g., diltiazem, beta-blockers) and anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events. Cardioversion may be considered if rate control is ineffective or the patient is unstable.",

      "Synchronized cardioversion delivers a lower energy shock compared to defibrillation. Always ensure the synchronizer is turned 'ON' for cardioversion.",

    "pathophysiology": "**SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia):** SVT is a rapid heart rhythm originating above the ventricles. It's often caused by a re-entry circuit in the AV node or accessory pathways. The rapid rate reduces ventricular filling time, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential hemodynamic instability. **Ventricular Fibrillation:** VF is a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by chaotic, uncoordinated electrical activity in the ventricles. This prevents effective ventricular contraction and cardiac output, leading to circulatory collapse and death if not treated immediately. Common causes include myocardial ischemia, electrolyte imbalances, and structural heart disease."
