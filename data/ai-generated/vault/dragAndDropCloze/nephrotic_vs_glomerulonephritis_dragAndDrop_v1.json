        "correct": "Nephrotic Syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria (greater than 3.5 g/day), leading to hypoalbuminemia and subsequent edema due to decreased oncotic pressure. The primary pathophysiology involves damage to the glomerular basement membrane, increasing its permeability to proteins. Acute Glomerulonephritis (AGN) is an inflammatory process affecting the glomeruli, often following a streptococcal infection. Immune complexes deposit in the glomeruli, triggering inflammation and damage, leading to hematuria, proteinuria (though less than nephrotic syndrome), hypertension (due to fluid retention and renin-angiotensin system activation), and edema.",
        "incorrect": "Wilms' Tumor is a malignant tumor of the kidney, typically presenting as an abdominal mass. Cystitis is a bladder infection, characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria, but does not typically cause the systemic symptoms seen in nephrotic syndrome or AGN.",
