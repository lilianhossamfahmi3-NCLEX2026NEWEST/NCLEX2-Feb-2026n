            "SBAR": "14:00, I am calling about John Smith, a 72-year-old male admitted for DVT. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on warfarin. The patient reported leg pain and swelling this morning. His vital signs are stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. He's alert and oriented. We've started him on oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min per protocol. The physician has ordered a heparin drip to be started concurrently with his warfarin. Labs are pending, but his INR this morning was 2.8. I am concerned about the risk of bleeding with the initiation of heparin while he's already on warfarin. Do you want to adjust the heparin dosing or consider bridging therapy differently? He's also complaining of mild back pain. Warfarin was last dose adjusted 3 days ago. Considering current orders, watch for signs of bleeding and monitor labs per orders, including aPTT and platelets. Call back with any concerns.",

Monitoring the aPTT is crucial for heparin, while PT/INR is for warfarin, though the INR is already elevated due to warfarin. A decreasing platelet count may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), requiring immediate intervention. The therapeutic INR range for atrial fibrillation and DVT is typically 2.0-3.0. An INR above this range further elevates bleeding risk. Vitamin K is the antidote for warfarin, and would be indicated for an INR above therapeutic range, in the presence of bleeding, or if emergent surgery is needed. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for heparin.",
