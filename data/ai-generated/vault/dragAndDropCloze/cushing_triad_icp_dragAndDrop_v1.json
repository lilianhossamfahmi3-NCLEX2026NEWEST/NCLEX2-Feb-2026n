    "correct": "Cushing's Triad is a late sign of increased ICP and impending herniation. It consists of: Hypertension (specifically, a widened pulse pressure), Bradycardia, and Irregular respirations (often Cheyne-Stokes respirations). The rising ICP compresses the vasomotor center in the medulla, leading to increased sympathetic outflow, causing hypertension. The baroreceptors detect the increased blood pressure and trigger a reflex bradycardia via the vagus nerve. Compression of the brainstem also disrupts the normal respiratory pattern.",
    "incorrect": "Tachycardia and hypotension are typically associated with shock, not increased ICP. Narrow pulse pressure is the opposite of what is seen in Cushing's Triad.",

      "Cushing's Triad is a LATE and ominous sign of increased ICP. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent brain herniation and death.",
      "The pulse pressure is calculated by subtracting the diastolic blood pressure from the systolic blood pressure. A widened pulse pressure indicates a significant difference between the two values.",
