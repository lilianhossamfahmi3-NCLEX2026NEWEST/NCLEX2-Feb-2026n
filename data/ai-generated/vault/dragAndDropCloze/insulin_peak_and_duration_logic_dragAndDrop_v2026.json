Given the patient's report of shakiness and lightheadedness, along with a recent blood glucose reading of 68 mg/dL at 08:30 and the administration of rapid-acting insulin at 07:00, hypoglycemia is the most immediate concern. Rapid-acting insulin like insulin aspart (Novolog) typically peaks within 1 to 3 hours after administration.",

Waiting and watching is not an appropriate action, as the blood glucose is rapidly decreasing. The duration of action is important, but the immediate concern is the peak effect causing hypoglycemia.",
