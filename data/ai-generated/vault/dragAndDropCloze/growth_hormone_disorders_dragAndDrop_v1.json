        "correct": "Gigantism occurs when excessive growth hormone (GH) is secreted *before* the epiphyseal plates close in childhood. This leads to accelerated linear growth, resulting in extreme height. Acromegaly, on the other hand, develops when GH excess occurs *after* the epiphyseal plates have fused in adulthood. Because linear growth is no longer possible, the bones thicken, particularly in the hands, feet, and face, leading to characteristic features like enlarged jaw, hands, and feet. Internal organs also enlarge, contributing to various health complications.",

Initial assessment reveals [relevant lab values, e.g., elevated IGF-1 levels].\nAssessment: The patient's symptoms and initial lab findings are suggestive of either gigantism or acromegaly. Further diagnostic testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause (e.g., pituitary tumor).\nRecommendation: I recommend obtaining a GH suppression test and MRI of the pituitary gland to confirm the diagnosis and assess for the presence of a pituitary tumor. Consult endocrinology for further management. Monitor vital signs, neurological status, and visual fields. Provide emotional support and education to the patient and family regarding the diagnostic process and potential treatment options. 0800 - Notify endocrinologist of lab results. 0900 - Schedule MRI. 1000 - Initiate GH suppression test."
