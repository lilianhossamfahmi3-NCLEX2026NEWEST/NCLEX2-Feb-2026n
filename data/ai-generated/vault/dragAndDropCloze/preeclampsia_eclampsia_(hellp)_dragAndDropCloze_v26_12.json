Preeclampsia can progress to HELLP syndrome, which involves systemic endothelial dysfunction. Thrombocytopenia results from platelet consumption and sequestration in the liver. Elevated liver enzymes indicate hepatocellular injury. Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia/eclampsia. However, it can potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents due to its neuromuscular blocking properties and calcium channel blocking effects, which can prolong muscle relaxation and increase the risk of respiratory depression if surgery (e.g., cesarean section) becomes necessary. Therefore, careful monitoring is crucial.",
