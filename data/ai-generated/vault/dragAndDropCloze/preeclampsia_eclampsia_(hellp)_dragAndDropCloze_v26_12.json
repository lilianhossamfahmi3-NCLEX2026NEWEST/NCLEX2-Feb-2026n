B: Diagnosed with gestational hypertension at 28 weeks. Managed with labetalol. No significant medical history. 18:10. A: BP 160/110 mmHg. +3 proteinuria. Hyperreflexia with 2 beats of clonus. Labs pending. Magnesium sulfate infusing at 2 g/hr. Fetal heart rate stable at 140 bpm. 18:15. R: Continue current magnesium sulfate infusion. Anticipate potential delivery due to worsening preeclampsia. Monitor BP, reflexes, and fetal heart rate closely. STAT lab results need to be reviewed. Notify provider of any significant changes.",

      "correct": "The client's presentation (preeclampsia, headache, blurred vision, elevated BP, proteinuria, hyperreflexia) combined with thrombocytopenia (platelets 90,000/μL) and elevated liver enzymes (AST 350 U/L, ALT 400 U/L, LDH 600 U/L) strongly suggests HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). Preeclampsia can progress to HELLP syndrome, which involves systemic endothelial dysfunction. Thrombocytopenia results from platelet consumption and sequestration in the liver. Elevated liver enzymes indicate hepatocellular injury. Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia/eclampsia. However, it can potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents due to its neuromuscular blocking properties and calcium channel blocking effects, which can prolong muscle relaxation and increase the risk of respiratory depression if surgery (e.g., cesarean section) becomes necessary.",

        "HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of preeclampsia that requires prompt recognition and management. Key indicators include thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/μL), elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), and evidence of hemolysis. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for preventing seizures in preeclampsia/eclampsia, but it requires careful monitoring to avoid magnesium toxicity. Be prepared to administer calcium gluconate if magnesium toxicity occurs (e.g., respiratory depression, loss of reflexes)."
