    "correct": "Mitten restraints are the least restrictive option to prevent a client from dislodging a nasogastric tube. They allow for some hand movement while hindering the ability to grasp and pull. Belt restraints are used to prevent falls from a wheelchair or chair, ensuring the client's safety while allowing some movement. The belt should be applied snugly but not restrict breathing or circulation.",
    "incorrect": "Vest restraints pose a significant risk of strangulation and are generally avoided. Wrist restraints are more restrictive than mitten restraints and should only be used when less restrictive measures have failed.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Assess neurovascular status (circulation, movement, sensation) of restrained extremities every 15-30 minutes. Release restraints every 2 hours for range of motion (ROM) exercises and skin assessment. Ensure two fingers can easily slide between the restraint and the client's skin.",
      "SBAR: Situation: Client is confused and at risk of pulling out NG tube/falling from wheelchair. Background: Client has a history of confusion and previous attempts to remove medical devices/fall from wheelchair. Assessment: Client is actively trying to pull at NG tube/demonstrates poor balance while seated. Recommendation: Apply mitten restraints to prevent NG tube removal/belt restraint to prevent falls. Notify provider for restraint order."

      "pathophysiology": "Unnecessary restraint use can lead to complications such as pressure ulcers, nerve damage, decreased circulation, and psychological distress. Restraints should only be used when all other alternatives have been exhausted and the client's safety is at risk. The least restrictive method should always be chosen."
