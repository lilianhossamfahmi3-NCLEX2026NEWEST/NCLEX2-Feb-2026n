Settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL, RR 16. SpO2 has been trending downward despite increased FiO2. \n0715: Noted increased work of breathing, agitation. Auscultated diffuse crackles bilaterally. Suctioned moderate amount of thin, frothy secretions. \n0730: SpO2 now 88%. Increased FiO2 to 70%. Noted decreased urine output (15 mL/hr). BP 90/60 mmHg. HR 120 bpm. Notified provider of changes. \n0745: Provider order received to obtain ABG and increase PEEP by 2 cm H2O every 15 minutes to a maximum of 10 cm H2O, monitoring BP closely. Repeat ABG in 1 hour."
