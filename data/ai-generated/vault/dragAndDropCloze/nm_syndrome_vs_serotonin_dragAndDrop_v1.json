        "correct": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening reaction to dopamine-antagonist medications, characterized by severe muscle rigidity, fever, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology involves a rapid decrease in dopamine activity in the brain, leading to uncontrolled muscle contractions and hyperthermia. Serotonin Syndrome results from excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system, often due to combining serotonergic medications. Symptoms include hyperreflexia, agitation, tremors, diaphoresis, and potentially life-threatening hyperthermia and cardiovascular collapse. At 08:00, assess vital signs and neurological status q15 minutes.",
        "incorrect": "Tardive Dyskinesia is a late-onset side effect of antipsychotic medications, characterized by involuntary movements, particularly of the face and tongue. It does not typically present with fever or rigidity. Wernicke Encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency, leading to confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. While it can present with altered mental status, it does not involve the muscle rigidity seen in NMS or the hyperreflexia of Serotonin Syndrome.",

The second client is being treated for depression with Sertraline and has been self-medicating with St. John's Wort.\n\nAssessment: At 07:00, the client on Haloperidol has a temperature of 104°F (40°C), severe muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. The client on Sertraline has hyperreflexia, tremors, diaphoresis, and agitation. Differential diagnoses include Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Serotonin Syndrome.\n\nRecommendation: Immediately discontinue the offending medications. For the client with suspected NMS, consider administering dantrolene or bromocriptine. For the client with suspected Serotonin Syndrome, consider administering cyproheptadine. Provide supportive care, including cooling measures and monitoring vital signs q15 minutes. Transfer to ICU for continuous monitoring and management."
