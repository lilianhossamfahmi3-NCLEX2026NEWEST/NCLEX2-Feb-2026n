Initial assessment within normal limits. 10:00: Noted to have increased work of breathing with nasal flaring and grunting. Color is pink centrally but circumoral cyanosis is present. Oxygen saturation 88% on room air. 10:15: Placed on nasal cannula at 2L/min, oxygen saturation now 92%. Respiratory rate 64 and labored. Heart rate 160. Temperature 37.1°C axillary. Mucus membranes appear moist. Infant is alert but tires quickly with feeding. Mother present at bedside. Pediatrician notified. 10:30: Continuing to monitor respiratory status and oxygen saturation. Preparing for potential transfer to NICU if respiratory distress worsens. Will continue to assess and document findings every 15 minutes."
