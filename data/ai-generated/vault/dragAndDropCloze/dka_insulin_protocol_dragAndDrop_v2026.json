History of type 1 diabetes, but reports non-compliance with insulin regimen for the past week due to feeling ‘sick of it.’ 14:05: Patient is alert to name only. Reports abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting. 14:10: IV access established. Initial blood glucose reading via glucometer is 580 mg/dL. 14:15: Physician notified and orders received per DKA protocol. 14:20: Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Urine ketones are large. Patient is currently receiving 0.9% normal saline at 250 mL/hr. Patient’s parents are at bedside and very concerned. Will continue to monitor vital signs and blood glucose levels closely per protocol. 14:25: Patient reports increased thirst."
