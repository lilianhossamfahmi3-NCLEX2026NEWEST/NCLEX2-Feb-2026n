  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Heparin, an indirect thrombin inhibitor, requires monitoring of the aPTT to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation. The therapeutic range for aPTT is typically 1.5-2.5 times the control value. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, inhibits the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. PT/INR is monitored to maintain a target INR of 2-3 for most indications, reflecting the degree of anticoagulation.",
    "incorrect": "Platelet count is monitored for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), a potential complication of heparin therapy characterized by a decrease in platelets and increased risk of thrombosis. Serum creatinine assesses renal function, which is important for drug clearance but not directly for monitoring anticoagulant effect.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Clinical Pearl: Remember the mnemonic 'PT/INR for Warfarin' and 'aPTT for Heparin'. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation and minimize bleeding risk.",
      "Clinical Pearl: Be vigilant for signs of bleeding (e.g., hematuria, melena, bruising) in patients on anticoagulants. Educate patients about the importance of adherence and potential drug interactions."
