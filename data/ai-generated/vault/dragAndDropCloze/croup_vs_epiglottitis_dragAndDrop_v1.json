        "correct": "Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is characterized by inflammation of the larynx and trachea, often caused by a viral infection (typically parainfluenza virus). This inflammation leads to airway narrowing, resulting in the hallmark barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Cool mist can help reduce swelling and ease breathing. Epiglottitis, usually caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (though less common due to vaccination), involves inflammation of the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage that covers the trachea during swallowing. This inflammation can rapidly obstruct the airway, leading to severe respiratory distress. The classic presentation includes drooling (due to difficulty swallowing), leaning forward in a tripod position (to maximize airway opening), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysphonia (muffled voice), and a high fever. Epiglottitis is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention to secure the airway.",
        "incorrect": "Bronchiolitis, commonly caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), primarily affects the bronchioles, leading to wheezing and increased mucus production, not typically a barking cough. Asthma involves airway inflammation and bronchospasm, resulting in expiratory wheezing and shortness of breath, not the classic signs of croup or epiglottitis.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "NEVER use a tongue depressor or look down the throat of a child with suspected epiglottitis as it can cause sudden airway closure. This can trigger complete airway obstruction.",
            "Maintain a calm environment for children with suspected epiglottitis to minimize anxiety and respiratory distress.",
            "Prepare for immediate intubation or tracheostomy in cases of epiglottitis.",

Croup patients, while having stridor, can typically swallow and do not exhibit the same level of respiratory distress as those with epiglottitis."

Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. The child is alert and able to speak in short sentences.\nRecommendation: Administer humidified oxygen, assess respiratory status frequently, and consider administering dexamethasone per physician order. Monitor for worsening respiratory distress and prepare for potential intubation if needed."
