Hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Last dose of metoprolol 50mg PO given at 06:00. EKG from ED showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin level pending. Patient is anxious and diaphoretic.\nA: BP 90/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Pain unrelieved by 2L O2 via NC. NTG SL given at 06:45 with no relief. Morphine 2mg IV given at 06:50. Continues to complain of severe chest pain.\nR: Requesting immediate cardiology consult. Pt. needs further evaluation and intervention for possible acute MI. Consider transfer to cardiac catheterization lab. Will continue to monitor vitals, pain level, and oxygen saturation."
