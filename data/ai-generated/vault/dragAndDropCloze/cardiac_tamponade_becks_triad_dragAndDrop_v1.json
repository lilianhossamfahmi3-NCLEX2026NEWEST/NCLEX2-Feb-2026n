        "correct": "Beck's Triad is the classic clinical presentation of cardiac tamponade: Muffled heart sounds, Jugular Venous Distention (JVD), and Hypotension. Pulsus paradoxus, an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (>10 mmHg) during inspiration, occurs because the increased venous return to the right ventricle during inspiration further compresses the already compromised left ventricle, reducing its stroke volume and systolic pressure. This is due to the pericardial effusion restricting cardiac filling.",

            "Bradycardia": "Bradycardia is not typically associated with cardiac tamponade; the body usually attempts to compensate with tachycardia to maintain cardiac output. Therefore, selecting this option is incorrect.",

            "Widened Pulse Pressure": "Widened pulse pressure is more commonly seen in conditions like increased intracranial pressure (ICP), while cardiac tamponade typically presents with a narrowed pulse pressure due to the reduced stroke volume. Therefore, selecting this option is incorrect."
