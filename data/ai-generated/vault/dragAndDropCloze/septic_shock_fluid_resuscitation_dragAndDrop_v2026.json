Urine output has decreased significantly over the last 4 hours. Lung sounds reveal diffuse crackles bilaterally. The patient received 500mL bolus of crystalloid fluid with minimal improvement in blood pressure. 07:45 R: Recommend initiating rapid fluid resuscitation and further assessment for septic shock. Consider vasopressor support if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Repeat lactate level and blood cultures are pending."
