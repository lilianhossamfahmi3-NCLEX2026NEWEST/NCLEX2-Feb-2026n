    "correct": "**Concrete Operational (7-11 years):** This stage is characterized by the development of logical thought regarding concrete events. Children grasp the concept of conservation (understanding that quantity remains the same despite changes in appearance) and can perform mathematical operations. The ability to classify and seriate objects also emerges. **Formal Operational (11+ years):** This stage marks the development of abstract and hypothetical thinking. Adolescents can reason deductively, consider multiple possibilities, and engage in scientific reasoning. They can also reflect on their own thinking processes (metacognition).",
    "incorrect": "**Preoperational (2-7 years):** Children in this stage exhibit egocentrism (difficulty seeing things from another's perspective), animism (believing inanimate objects are alive), and magical thinking. They struggle with conservation and logical operations. **Sensorimotor (0-2 years):** Infants learn about the world through sensory experiences and motor actions. Key milestones include object permanence (understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight) and the development of basic reflexes.",
