Gross motor skills appear age-appropriate; however, fine motor skills, such as grasping and manipulating small objects, are underdeveloped. A: Potential developmental delay suspected. Further assessment warranted to determine the extent of the delay and identify appropriate interventions. B: Continue to monitor developmental milestones. Consult with pediatrician regarding referral to early intervention services. Educate mother on age-appropriate activities to promote development. 07:15 Notified Dr. Smith of findings."
