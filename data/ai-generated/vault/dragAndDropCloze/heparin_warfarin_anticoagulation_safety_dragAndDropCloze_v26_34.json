She initially responded well to the treatment, but her INR has been fluctuating. She denies any bleeding or bruising.\n\n**Assessment:** Patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm and irregular, RR 18, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F), SpO2 98% on room air. Lungs clear to auscultation. No edema noted. Heart sounds irregular. Current aPTT is pending review. Current INR is pending review. No signs of bleeding or unusual bruising noted. She reports mild fatigue but no other complaints.\n\n**Recommendation:** Please review the latest aPTT and INR results and adjust the heparin and warfarin doses accordingly. Consider repeating labs later today to assess response to any changes in dosage. Monitor for any signs of bleeding. Continue to assess for atrial fibrillation control.",
