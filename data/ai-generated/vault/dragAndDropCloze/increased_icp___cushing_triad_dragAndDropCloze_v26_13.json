        "correct": "Cushing's triad is a late sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and indicates impending brain herniation. The triad consists of bradycardia, hypertension with widening pulse pressure, and irregular respirations. The nurse's immediate actions should be aimed at reducing ICP and supporting cerebral perfusion. Elevating the head of the bed helps to promote venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Subsequently, notifying the provider is essential to facilitate further interventions such as medication administration or surgical intervention. ",
        "incorrect": "Failing to elevate the head of the bed initially delays crucial ICP reduction efforts. While administering a bolus of IV fluids might seem helpful, it can exacerbate ICP if the patient has cerebral edema. Administering an antiemetic is not a primary intervention for managing increased ICP associated with Cushing's triad. Waiting and reassessing in 30 minutes delays critical interventions and could lead to further neurological deterioration. Lowering the head of bed will increase ICP.",
