    "correct": "The patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 400 cells/mm3 indicates severe neutropenia, a condition characterized by a significantly reduced number of neutrophils, which are essential for fighting infection. This puts the patient at high risk for infection. Initiating neutropenic precautions is the priority to protect the patient from potential sources of infection and prevent life-threatening complications.",
    "incorrect": "While the other options may be relevant aspects of care for a patient undergoing chemotherapy, they are not the immediate priority in this scenario. The severely low ANC poses the most immediate and life-threatening risk. Administering antiemetic medication addresses nausea, which is important for comfort but not as critical as preventing infection in a neutropenic patient. Reporting the elevated creatinine level to the provider is necessary, but the ANC requires more immediate action. Instructing the patient to increase oral fluid intake is a general measure to prevent dehydration, but it does not address the immediate risk of infection due to neutropenia.",
