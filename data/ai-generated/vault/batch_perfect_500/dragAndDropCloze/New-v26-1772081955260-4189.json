        "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate priorities in sepsis management: addressing hypotension, infection, and organ dysfunction. IV fluids address hypotension and improve perfusion. Antibiotics target the infection. Vasopressors are initiated if fluids alone are not enough to maintain adequate blood pressure. Oxygen ensures adequate tissue oxygenation, particularly important given the pneumonia. Monitoring urine output assesses kidney function and response to fluid resuscitation. Monitoring lactate levels tracks the effectiveness of treatment and identifies ongoing tissue hypoxia.\n\nclinicalPearl: Early interventions in sepsis significantly improve patient outcomes by preventing irreversible organ damage and shock.",
