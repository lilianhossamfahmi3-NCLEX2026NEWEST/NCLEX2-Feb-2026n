  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate priorities in sepsis management: addressing hypotension, infection, and organ dysfunction. IV fluids address hypotension and improve perfusion. Antibiotics target the infection. Vasopressors are initiated if fluids alone are not enough to maintain adequate blood pressure. Oxygen ensures adequate tissue oxygenation, particularly important given the pneumonia. Monitoring urine output assesses kidney function and response to fluid resuscitation. Monitoring lactate levels tracks the effectiveness of treatment and identifies ongoing tissue hypoxia. Blood glucose control prevents further complications.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers prioritize actions out of order or neglect critical aspects of sepsis management. For example, delaying fluid resuscitation in favor of antibiotics can lead to irreversible shock. Not addressing hypoxemia early can worsen organ damage. Failing to monitor urine output prevents early detection of kidney injury.",
