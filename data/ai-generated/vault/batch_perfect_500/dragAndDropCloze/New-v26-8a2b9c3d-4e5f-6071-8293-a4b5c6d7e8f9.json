Monitor [drag3] neurological status, including LOC, pupillary response, and motor function, every hour.\n4. Implement measures to prevent [drag4] Valsalva maneuver, such as stool softeners, to avoid increasing ICP.\n5. Maintain [drag5] normothermia (36-37°C) to reduce metabolic demand and cerebral blood flow.",

        "correct": "The interventions listed are prioritized based on the immediate need to reduce ICP and prevent further neurological damage. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that will help draw fluid out of the brain tissue. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage, which reduces ICP. Frequent neurological assessments are critical to monitor for changes and the effectiveness of interventions. Preventing the Valsalva maneuver helps to avoid increases in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain, thus increasing ICP. Maintaining normothermia reduces cerebral metabolic demand and blood flow. Hyperthermia greatly increases metabolic demands.",

        "incorrect": "Reversing the order or prioritizing less critical interventions can lead to increased ICP and further neurological damage. Delaying mannitol administration or failing to elevate the head of the bed will prolong cerebral edema and increase the risk of herniation. Infrequent neurological assessments may delay the detection of worsening conditions. Ignoring measures to prevent the Valsalva maneuver can exacerbate ICP. Neglecting temperature control will increase metabolic demand and cerebral blood flow, worsening ICP.",

B: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was last seen normal at 22:00 the previous day. A: As of 08:00, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 11 (Eyes 3, Verbal 3, Motor 5). His right-sided weakness is pronounced, and a CT scan has confirmed a left-sided hemorrhagic stroke. His current blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg. Heart rate is 92 bpm, regular. Respiratory rate is 22, labored. Oxygen saturation is 94% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature is 38.5°C. We initiated oxygen therapy and continuous cardiac monitoring per stroke protocol. R: I am highly concerned about the possibility of increased ICP given his stroke location, GCS, and vital signs. I am requesting orders for mannitol to address potential cerebral edema and for frequent, close neurological monitoring. I also need assistance with blood pressure management, given the elevated readings despite PRN hydralazine availability. I also recommend interventions to manage his elevated temperature.",
