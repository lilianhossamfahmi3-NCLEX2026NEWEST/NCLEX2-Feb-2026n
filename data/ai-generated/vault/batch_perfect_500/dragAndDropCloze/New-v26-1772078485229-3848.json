    "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to an infection.  Rapid identification and treatment, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to improve outcomes.  Vasopressors may be needed if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Monitoring lactate levels helps assess tissue perfusion and response to treatment.",

    "incorrect": "Understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis and its management is vital for nurses. Incorrect choices reflect a misunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms, appropriate interventions, or the importance of timely action.  For example, delaying antibiotics increases mortality.
