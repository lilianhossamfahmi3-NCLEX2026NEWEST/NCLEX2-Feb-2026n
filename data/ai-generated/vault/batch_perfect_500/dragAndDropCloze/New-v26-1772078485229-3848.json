        "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to an infection. Rapid identification and treatment, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to improve outcomes. Vasopressors may be needed if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Monitoring lactate levels helps assess tissue perfusion and response to treatment.\n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and aggressive management are key to improving patient outcomes in sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered within one hour of sepsis recognition. Fluid resuscitation is essential to address hypovolemia and improve tissue perfusion. Vasopressors are indicated if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation.\n",

        "incorrect": "Understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis and its management is vital for nurses. Incorrect choices reflect a misunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms, appropriate interventions, or the importance of timely action. For example, delaying antibiotics increases mortality. Failing to address hypotension can lead to end-organ damage.\n\nquestionTrap: Selecting incorrect options may indicate a lack of understanding of the urgency and importance of early interventions in sepsis. For example, choosing 'antivirals' or 'antifungals' instead of 'broad-spectrum antibiotics' demonstrates a misunderstanding of the initial management of sepsis before the causative organism is identified. Similarly, failing to recognize the importance of fluid resuscitation and vasopressors in addressing hypotension can lead to inadequate patient management.",
