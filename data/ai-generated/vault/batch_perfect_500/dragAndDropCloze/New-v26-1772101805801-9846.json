A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg requires immediate intervention due to the risk of hypotension, another potential side effect of furosemide, which can lead to dizziness, falls, and decreased organ perfusion. Crackles auscultated in the lung bases require immediate intervention as they indicate worsening heart failure and fluid overload, suggesting the current treatment regimen is inadequate.",
