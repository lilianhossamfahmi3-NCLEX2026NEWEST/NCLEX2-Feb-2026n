        "correct": "1. Initiate IV access: Establishing IV access is crucial for administering fluids and medications promptly in bacterial meningitis. Rapid vascular access allows for immediate intervention, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. 2. Administer ordered antibiotics: Prompt antibiotic administration is essential in treating bacterial meningitis. Delaying antibiotics increases the risk of neurological damage and sepsis. 3. Prepare for lumbar puncture: Lumbar puncture is necessary for CSF analysis to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific causative organism. This guides targeted antibiotic therapy. 4. Administer antipyretic medication: Reducing fever helps manage the child's discomfort and metabolic demands. High fever can exacerbate neurological symptoms and increase the risk of seizures. 5. Monitor neurological status frequently: Frequent neurological assessments are critical for detecting changes in condition and signs of increased ICP. Early detection of neurological deterioration allows for timely intervention to prevent irreversible damage.",

        "incorrect": "Reversing the order can lead to delays in critical interventions and potentially worsen the patient's condition. For example, delaying antibiotics increases the risk of neurological damage and sepsis. Performing a lumbar puncture before starting antibiotics may delay treatment unnecessarily. Monitoring neurological status is important, but it should not take precedence over initiating treatment.",
