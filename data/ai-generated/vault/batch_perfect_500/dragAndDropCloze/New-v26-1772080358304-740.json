    "correct": "1. Initiate IV access: Establishing IV access is crucial for administering fluids and medications promptly. 2. Administer ordered antibiotics: Prompt antibiotic administration is essential in treating bacterial meningitis. 3. Prepare for lumbar puncture: Lumbar puncture is necessary for CSF analysis to confirm the diagnosis. 4. Administer antipyretic medication: Reducing fever helps manage the child's discomfort and metabolic demands. 5. Monitor neurological status frequently: Frequent neurological assessments are critical for detecting changes in condition and signs of increased ICP.",

    "incorrect": "Reversing the order can lead to delays in critical interventions and potentially worsen the patient's condition. For example, delaying antibiotics increases the risk of neurological damage and sepsis. Performing a lumbar puncture before starting antibiotics may delay treatment unnecessarily. Monitoring neurological status is important, but it should not take precedence over initiating treatment.",
