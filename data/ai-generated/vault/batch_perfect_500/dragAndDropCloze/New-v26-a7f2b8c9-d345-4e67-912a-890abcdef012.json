Monitoring respiratory status and oxygenation is critical. Promoting adequate lung expansion through deep breathing and coughing prevents complications. Pain management is essential for comfort and recovery. BNP levels < 100 pg/mL are desirable, but 200 pg/mL is not alarming at this stage. The furosemide dosage is low and appropriate to prevent fluid overload.",

    "sbar": "S: Samuel Jones is a 6-month-old male, admitted to the PICU post-operative day 1 following a Tetralogy of Fallot repair. The surgery aimed to correct the congenital heart defect. He was extubated at 10:00 this morning and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. O: The surgical site dressing is clean, dry, and intact, with no signs of bleeding or infection. His vital signs at 14:00 are as follows: heart rate 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, and temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius. He reports a pain level of 3 out of 10 and is receiving morphine for pain management. His last dose was administered at 13:00. A: Samuel is currently stable, but requires vigilant monitoring for potential post-operative complications, including pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and respiratory distress. His BNP level is currently 200 pg/mL. R: Continue with current orders for oxygen supplementation, pain management with morphine as needed, and scheduled furosemide administration. Closely monitor his respiratory status, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and work of breathing. Administer pain medication as needed, and notify the physician if respiratory distress increases or if oxygen saturation drops below 90%. Obtain a STAT BNP if there is a significant increase in respiratory distress.",
