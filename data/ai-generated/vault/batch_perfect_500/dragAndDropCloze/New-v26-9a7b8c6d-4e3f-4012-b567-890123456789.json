Based on the assessment findings, prioritize the following interventions in order of importance to manage the patient's condition:\n\n1. Assess and massage the uterine fundus to promote [cloze-1] and expulsion of clots.\n2. Administer [cloze-2] IV per standing order to contract the uterus.\n3. Initiate oxygen therapy via [cloze-3] at 6-8 L/min if oxygen saturation is less than 95%.\n4. Monitor vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, every [cloze-4] minutes.\n5. Prepare for potential fluid resuscitation with [cloze-5] if signs of hypovolemic shock are present.\n\n**Options:**\n*   uterine contraction\n*   normal saline\n*   15\n*   oxytocin\n*   nasal cannula",

    "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate need to address uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Fundal massage is the first-line intervention to stimulate uterine contraction. Oxytocin is administered to further contract the uterus. Oxygen is indicated if saturation drops below 95%. Frequent monitoring of vital signs helps to detect changes in the patient's condition. Finally, fluid resuscitation is crucial to address hypovolemia caused by blood loss.",

    "sbar": "Situation: I'm calling about Jane Doe, a 28-year-old female, DOB 03/15/1998, postpartum day 1 after spontaneous vaginal delivery. Background: Patient delivered a healthy baby boy at 0100 without complications. Assessment: At 0630, nursing staff noticed increased vaginal bleeding, saturating one pad in 15 minutes. The fundus is boggy, located 2 cm above the umbilicus and deviated to the right. Moderate clots were expelled with massage. Vital signs at 0630: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 99.8°F (37.7°C). The patient reports dizziness. Recommendation: At 0645, I massaged the fundus, but it remains boggy. I suspect she's experiencing postpartum hemorrhage. She has an IV of Lactated Ringers infusing at 125 mL/hr. Oxytocin 20 units in 1000 mL NS is prescribed and infusing at 125mL/hr. Labs are pending. I am requesting orders for further management, including consideration for additional uterotonics, blood products if indicated, and continued monitoring.",
