        "correct": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The initial infection triggers an excessive inflammatory response, leading to widespread inflammation, endothelial damage, and microvascular dysfunction. This results in decreased tissue perfusion and organ damage. Early interventions such as broad-spectrum antibiotics to target the source of infection and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and improve blood pressure are critical in managing sepsis and preventing further complications such as septic shock and multi-organ failure. Vasopressors are considered if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nclinicalPearls: Early recognition and treatment within the first hour (often called the 'golden hour') significantly improves patient outcomes in sepsis. Use of a standardized sepsis screening tool can aid in early identification.\nquestionTrap: Selecting 'vasopressors' as a first-line treatment is a common trap. While vasopressors are important in sepsis management, they are typically used after initial fluid resuscitation has been attempted. Oxygen is supportive but not a primary intervention.\nmnemonic: SIRS - Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (precursor to sepsis): Temp >38°C or <36°C, HR >90, RR >20 or PaCO2 <32, WBC >12,000 or <4,000 or >10% bands.",
