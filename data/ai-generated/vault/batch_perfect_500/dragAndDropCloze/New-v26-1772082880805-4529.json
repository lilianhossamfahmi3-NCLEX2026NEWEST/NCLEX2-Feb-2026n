Strategies include using __________ tidal volumes and maintaining plateau pressures below __________ cm H2O.  __________ is often necessary to achieve adequate oxygenation, but should be used cautiously due to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).  Prone positioning can help improve __________ by redistributing lung perfusion.  Finally, managing __________ balance is critical to prevent fluid overload, which can worsen pulmonary edema.",

    "correct": "The primary goal in ARDS is to improve oxygenation while minimizing lung injury. Low tidal volumes are used to reduce barotrauma. Plateau pressures should be kept below 30 cm H2O to prevent overdistension of the alveoli. PEEP can improve oxygenation but increases the risk of VILI. Prone positioning redistributes perfusion to improve ventilation/perfusion matching. Careful fluid management prevents worsening pulmonary edema.",
