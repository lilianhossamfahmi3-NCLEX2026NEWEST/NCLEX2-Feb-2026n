Strategies include using __________ tidal volumes and maintaining plateau pressures below __________ cm H2O.  __________ is often necessary to achieve adequate oxygenation but should be used cautiously due to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).  __________ can help improve ventilation/perfusion matching by redistributing lung perfusion.  Finally, managing __________ balance is critical to prevent fluid overload, which can worsen pulmonary edema.",

        "correct": "The primary goal in ARDS is to improve oxygenation while minimizing lung injury. Low tidal volumes are used to reduce barotrauma and volutrauma. Plateau pressures should be kept below 30 cm H2O to prevent overdistension of the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse but increases the risk of VILI if used excessively. Prone positioning redistributes perfusion to improve ventilation/perfusion matching. Careful fluid management prevents worsening pulmonary edema and ensures optimal gas exchange.\n\n",
