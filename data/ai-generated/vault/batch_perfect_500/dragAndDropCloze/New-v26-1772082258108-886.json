    "correct": "1. Perform a non-stress test (NST) is the correct action to directly assess fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement, providing immediate information about fetal well-being. 2. Biophysical profile (BPP) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of fetal well-being, including amniotic fluid volume, fetal breathing movements, fetal tone, and gross body movements, in addition to fetal heart rate. 3. Fetal compromise is a potential sign of decreased fetal movement. Prompt evaluation allows for timely intervention if necessary.",
