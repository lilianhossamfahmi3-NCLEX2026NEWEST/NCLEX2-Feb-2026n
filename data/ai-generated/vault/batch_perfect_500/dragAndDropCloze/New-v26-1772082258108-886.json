        "correct": "1. Perform a non-stress test (NST) is the correct action to directly assess fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement, providing immediate information about fetal well-being. The NST is a non-invasive method that monitors the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movements. A reactive NST (two or more accelerations of the fetal heart rate within a 20-minute period) indicates good fetal well-being. 2. Biophysical profile (BPP) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of fetal well-being, including amniotic fluid volume, fetal breathing movements, fetal tone, and gross body movements, in addition to fetal heart rate. A BPP score of 8-10 is considered normal, while a score of 6 or less may indicate fetal compromise. 3. Fetal compromise is a potential sign of decreased fetal movement. Prompt evaluation allows for timely intervention if necessary. Decreased fetal movement can be associated with placental insufficiency, fetal hypoxia, or other underlying conditions that require immediate attention.",

        "incorrect": "1. Palpate the abdomen to assess for contractions may be part of the assessment, but it is not the priority action for evaluating decreased fetal movement. While assessing for contractions is important in labor, the immediate concern with decreased fetal movement is to evaluate fetal well-being directly. 2. Ultrasound for fetal position may be helpful in some situations, but it does not directly assess fetal well-being in the context of decreased fetal movement. Determining fetal position is not the priority when the patient reports decreased fetal movement. 3. Normal fetal activity is the opposite of what the patient is experiencing and would be incorrect and misleading. Decreased fetal movement is a deviation from the expected norm and should always be investigated.",
