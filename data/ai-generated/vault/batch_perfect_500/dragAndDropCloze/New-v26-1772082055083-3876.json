        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes interventions based on the patient's immediate needs for airway management and oxygenation, followed by addressing the infection and inflammation driving the exacerbation. Addressing the airway and breathing is paramount in COPD exacerbations to prevent respiratory failure. Oxygen is carefully titrated to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive, while bronchodilators alleviate bronchospasm. Antibiotics target potential bacterial infections, and corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation. Continuous monitoring ensures the effectiveness of interventions.",
