        "correct": "Insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating glucose uptake into cells, primarily by binding to insulin receptors on cell membranes, which triggers the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface. Glucagon raises blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) in the liver. Cortisol raises blood glucose by promoting gluconeogenesis in the liver and inhibiting insulin action in peripheral tissues, leading to increased blood glucose levels.",
