        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is to first apply oxygen to improve oxygen saturation, then initiate continuous monitoring to assess response to treatment and detect changes in condition, then administer a bronchodilator to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow, and finally, obtain a blood culture to identify a potential source of infection. Addressing hypoxia is paramount, followed by continuous monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Bronchodilators help alleviate airway obstruction, and blood cultures aid in identifying potential infections contributing to the infant's condition.",

For example, delaying oxygen administration could lead to further hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Administering a bronchodilator before ensuring adequate oxygenation may not be effective and could increase cardiac workload. Obtaining a blood culture before stabilizing the patient may delay critical interventions.",
