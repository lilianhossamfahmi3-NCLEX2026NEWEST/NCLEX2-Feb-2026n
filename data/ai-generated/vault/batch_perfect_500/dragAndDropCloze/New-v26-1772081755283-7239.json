    "correct": "The correct order of interventions is to first apply oxygen to improve oxygen saturation, then initiate continuous monitoring to assess response to treatment and detect changes in condition, then administer a bronchodilator to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow, and finally, obtain a blood culture to identify a potential source of infection.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of interventions can delay necessary treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. For example, delaying oxygen administration could lead to further hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Administering a bronchodilator before ensuring adequate oxygenation may not be effective and could increase cardiac workload. Obtaining a blood culture before stabilizing the patient may delay critical interventions.",
