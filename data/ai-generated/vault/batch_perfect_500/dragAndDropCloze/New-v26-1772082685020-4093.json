Administering IV antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis is the highest priority to prevent neonatal sepsis. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial for detecting fetal distress. Assessing maternal vital signs helps identify signs of infection or complications. Monitoring contraction pattern and cervical dilation helps to assess labor progress.
