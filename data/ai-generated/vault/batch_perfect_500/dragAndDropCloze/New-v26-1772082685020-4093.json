        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes interventions based on potential risks to the mother and fetus. Administering IV antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis is the highest priority to prevent neonatal sepsis, which can have devastating consequences for the newborn. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial for detecting fetal distress, such as decelerations or tachycardia, which may indicate hypoxia. Assessing maternal vital signs helps identify signs of infection (e.g., elevated temperature, tachycardia) or complications like preeclampsia (e.g., elevated blood pressure). Monitoring contraction pattern and cervical dilation helps to assess labor progress and identify potential dystocia. Providing comfort measures is important for the patient's well-being, but a lower priority compared to interventions addressing immediate risks.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect orderings misprioritize interventions, potentially leading to delays in addressing critical maternal or fetal needs.
