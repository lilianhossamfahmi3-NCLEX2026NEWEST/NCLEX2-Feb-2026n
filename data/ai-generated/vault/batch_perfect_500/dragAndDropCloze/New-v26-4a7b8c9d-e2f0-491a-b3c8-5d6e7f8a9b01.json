Current ventilator settings include FiO2 40%, Rate 16 breaths/min, Tidal Volume 450 mL, and PEEP 5 cm H2O. The latest Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) results at 0600 reveal: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 85 mmHg, and HCO3 24 mEq/L, indicating respiratory acidosis. He's receiving continuous sedation via propofol to manage anxiety and promote ventilator synchrony. He received his scheduled dose of vancomycin at 0630. Of note, the high Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) alarm has been sounding frequently, suggesting increased airway resistance. Additionally, his respiratory rate has been trending upwards, increasing from 18 to 24 breaths per minute within the last hour, which warrants further investigation. These changes could indicate worsening respiratory status or other complications that require immediate attention and intervention.",
