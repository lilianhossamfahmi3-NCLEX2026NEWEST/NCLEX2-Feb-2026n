    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of interventions can delay treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. Oxygen administration is the priority to address hypoxemia. Bronchodilators should be administered before corticosteroids to open the airways and allow the steroid to reach the lower airways. Cardiac monitoring is important but not the immediate priority.",
