  "stimulus": "For the patient described, the nurse would expect the TSH level to be {TSH} and the Free T4 level to be {Free T4}.",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Elevated TSH and Decreased Free T4 are characteristic findings in hypothyroidism. The pituitary gland releases TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce T4. When T4 levels are low, the pituitary gland releases more TSH in an attempt to stimulate T4 production, leading to elevated TSH levels. Free T4 is the unbound, active form of thyroxine, and its level decreases in hypothyroidism due to reduced thyroid hormone production.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "phrase": "High TSH, Low T4, Hypo no more!",
      "explanation": "This mnemonic helps remember the characteristic lab values in hypothyroidism: High TSH and Low Free T4."
    },
    "incorrect": "Normal TSH and Elevated Free T4 would indicate hyperthyroidism, which is the opposite of the patient's suspected condition. Low TSH and Normal Free T4 may indicate secondary hypothyroidism or other pituitary issues. Normal TSH and Normal Free T4 would indicate euthyroidism, ruling out thyroid dysfunction.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reasoning": "Ensure you understand the inverse relationship between TSH and Free T4 in primary hypothyroidism. A high TSH indicates the pituitary is trying to stimulate a failing thyroid gland, resulting in low Free T4.",
      "commonMistake": "Students may confuse the expected TSH and Free T4 levels in hypothyroidism, especially if they don't understand the feedback loop between the pituitary and thyroid glands."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "TSH is the most sensitive test for primary hypothyroidism.",
      "Free T4 measures the unbound, metabolically active portion of thyroxine.",
