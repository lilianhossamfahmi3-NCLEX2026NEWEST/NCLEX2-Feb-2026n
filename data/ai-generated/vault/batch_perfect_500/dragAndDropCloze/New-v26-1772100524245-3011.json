The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The nurse should administer oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Place the following nursing interventions in the correct order of priority:\n\n1.  Assess respiratory status, including lung sounds and work of breathing.\n2.  Administer prescribed bronchodilator medication via nebulizer.\n3.  Monitor oxygen saturation continuously.\n4.  Educate the child and family about asthma management.\n5.  Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.\n6.  Document interventions and patient response.",
