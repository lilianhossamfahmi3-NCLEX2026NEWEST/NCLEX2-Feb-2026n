    "correct": "Left MCA: Right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia are classic signs of a stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). These areas control motor function and language, respectively, on the contralateral side of the body.  Cerebellum: Ataxia and balance problems are commonly associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Occipital Lobe: Visual disturbances, such as hemianopia or cortical blindness, are characteristic of occipital lobe damage. Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing and memory consolidation are primarily functions of the temporal lobe, hence difficulty understanding speech.",
