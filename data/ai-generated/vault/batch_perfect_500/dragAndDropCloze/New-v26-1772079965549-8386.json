        "correct": "Left MCA: Right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia are classic signs of a stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). These areas control motor function and language, respectively, on the contralateral side of the body. Cerebellum: Ataxia and balance problems are commonly associated with cerebellar dysfunction. The cerebellum coordinates movement and balance. Occipital Lobe: Visual disturbances, such as hemianopia or cortical blindness, are characteristic of occipital lobe damage. The occipital lobe processes visual information. Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing and memory consolidation are primarily functions of the temporal lobe; hence, difficulty understanding speech (receptive aphasia) indicates temporal lobe involvement.",

For example, patients experiencing right-sided weakness will not experience cerebellar dysfunction. Rather, that will be localized to the contralateral side of the brain, which is the left MCA.
