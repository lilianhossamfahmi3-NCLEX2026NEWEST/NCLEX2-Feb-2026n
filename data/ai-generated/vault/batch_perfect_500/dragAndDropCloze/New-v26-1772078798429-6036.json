Assess the patient's response to interventions. Oxygenation is the highest priority to address the patient's hypoxemia. Bronchodilators are administered to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow. Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation. Finally, assessing the patient's response is vital to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and guide further treatment.",
