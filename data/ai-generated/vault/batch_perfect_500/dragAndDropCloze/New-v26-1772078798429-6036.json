    "correct": "The correct order is: 1. Administer oxygen to achieve target saturation. 2. Administer a short-acting bronchodilator. 3. Administer corticosteroids. 4. Assess the patient's response to interventions.  Oxygenation is the highest priority to address the patient's hypoxemia. Bronchodilators are administered to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow. Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation. Finally, assessing the patient's response is vital to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and guide further treatment.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers may prioritize interventions out of order, potentially delaying critical treatments or failing to adequately assess the patient's response to therapy. For example, administering corticosteroids before addressing hypoxemia or failing to assess the patient's response can lead to suboptimal outcomes.",

      "COPD exacerbations are a common cause of hospitalization.",
