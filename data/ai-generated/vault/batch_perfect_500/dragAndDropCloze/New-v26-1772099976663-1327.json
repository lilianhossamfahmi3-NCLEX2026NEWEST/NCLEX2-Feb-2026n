        "correct": "The fundus should be firm and midline immediately after delivery to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. A boggy or laterally displaced fundus can indicate uterine atony or a full bladder, respectively, both of which increase the risk of bleeding. Lochia rubra, which is mostly blood, is expected for the first 1-3 days postpartum as the uterus sheds its lining. The perineum should be assessed for edema, ecchymosis, and approximation of the episiotomy or laceration repair to identify potential complications such as infection or hematoma formation.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of normal postpartum assessment findings and potential complications. For example, selecting 'soft' or 'lateral' for the fundus suggests a failure to recognize signs of uterine atony or bladder distention, which are critical to address promptly.",

            "A boggy fundus requires immediate intervention such as fundal massage and medication administration (e.g., oxytocin) to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.",
