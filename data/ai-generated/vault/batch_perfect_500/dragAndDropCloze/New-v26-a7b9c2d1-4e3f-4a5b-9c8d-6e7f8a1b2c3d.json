The infusion rate is calculated as 1200 units/hour / 100 units/mL = 12 mL/hr. The aPTT should be monitored 6 hours after the bolus administration to assess the effectiveness of the heparin therapy and adjust the infusion rate as needed per protocol.

Current medications are warfarin, amlodipine, and atorvastatin. He has a history of non-compliance with warfarin therapy, resulting in a subtherapeutic INR.\nA: At 07:00, the physician ordered a heparin bolus and continuous infusion.
