    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate assessment and intervention to minimize brain damage in a stroke. Establish IV access allows for medication administration. Obtain CT scan is crucial to rule out hemorrhage before administering thrombolytics. Activate stroke team ensures proper management and coordination of care. Administer thrombolytics (if CT negative) within the appropriate time window can significantly improve outcomes. Monitor neurological status frequently to detect any changes and adjust treatment accordingly.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers often prioritize less urgent tasks or perform interventions out of order, potentially delaying critical treatment and worsening patient outcomes. For example, delaying CT scan can lead to inappropriate thrombolytic administration in the event of a hemorrhagic stroke. Monitoring neurological status is important, but not the highest priority initially when other interventions are time-sensitive.",
