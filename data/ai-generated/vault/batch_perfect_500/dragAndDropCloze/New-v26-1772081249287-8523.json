        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate assessment and intervention to minimize brain damage in a stroke. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Obtaining a CT scan of the head is crucial to rule out hemorrhage before administering thrombolytics. Activating the stroke team ensures proper management and coordination of care. Administering thrombolytics (if CT negative) within the appropriate time window can significantly improve outcomes. Frequent monitoring of neurological status helps detect any changes and adjust treatment accordingly. Each step is time-sensitive and crucial for optimal patient outcomes.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers often prioritize less urgent tasks or perform interventions out of order, potentially delaying critical treatment and worsening patient outcomes. For example, delaying the CT scan can lead to inappropriate thrombolytic administration in the event of a hemorrhagic stroke. Monitoring neurological status is important, but not the highest priority initially when other interventions are time-sensitive. Prioritizing interventions out of sequence can lead to irreversible neurological damage.",
