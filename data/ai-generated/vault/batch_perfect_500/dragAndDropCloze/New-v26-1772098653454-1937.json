        "correct": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The body's response leads to widespread inflammation and potential organ damage. Rapid administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation are critical in the management of sepsis. The inflammatory response is triggered by the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, leading to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and ultimately, shock if not treated promptly. IV fluids help to restore intravascular volume and support blood pressure, while antibiotics target the underlying infection.",
