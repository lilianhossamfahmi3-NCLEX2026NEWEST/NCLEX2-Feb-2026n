        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions first. Administering oxygen addresses the hypoxemia indicated by the ABG results. Administering a bronchodilator reverses bronchospasm, improving airflow. Administering corticosteroids addresses inflammation, reducing airway swelling. Encouraging coughing and deep breathing promotes secretion clearance, further improving ventilation. Monitoring ABGs assesses the effectiveness of the interventions and guides further adjustments to therapy.",
