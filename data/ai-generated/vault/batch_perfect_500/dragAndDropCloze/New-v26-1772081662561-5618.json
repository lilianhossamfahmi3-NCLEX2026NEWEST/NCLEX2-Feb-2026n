    "correct": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasize a time-sensitive approach. Measuring lactate and obtaining blood cultures are crucial for diagnosis and guiding therapy. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of recognition of sepsis is critical. Fluid resuscitation helps improve perfusion. Vasopressors are used if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring is essential to assess response to treatment.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying antibiotics or fluid resuscitation can worsen patient outcomes.
