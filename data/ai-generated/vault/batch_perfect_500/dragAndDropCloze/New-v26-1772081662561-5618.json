        "correct": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasize a time-sensitive approach. Measuring lactate and obtaining blood cultures are crucial for diagnosis and guiding therapy. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of recognition of sepsis is critical to combat the infection. Fluid resuscitation helps improve perfusion and blood pressure. Vasopressors are used if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation to maintain organ perfusion. Continuous monitoring is essential to assess response to treatment and adjust interventions accordingly. \n\nclinicalPearl: Remember the importance of early goal-directed therapy in sepsis management. \nquestionTrap: Prioritizing interventions based on convenience rather than clinical urgency can lead to poor patient outcomes.",

Vasopressors should not be used before attempting fluid resuscitation unless the patient is severely hypotensive and unresponsive to initial fluid bolus. Basic comfort measures are important but are not the highest priority in the initial management of sepsis. Administering antipyretics is important for fever management but less critical than addressing the underlying infection and hemodynamic instability. \n\nclinicalPearl: Always consider the potential for underlying conditions that may mimic sepsis, such as adrenal insufficiency or toxic shock syndrome.",
