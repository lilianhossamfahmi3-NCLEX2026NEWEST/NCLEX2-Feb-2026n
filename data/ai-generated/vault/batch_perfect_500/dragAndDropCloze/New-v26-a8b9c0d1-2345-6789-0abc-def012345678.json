    "correct": "Hypovolemic shock requires rapid intervention to restore circulating volume and oxygen delivery. Applying direct pressure is the immediate priority to control the source of bleeding. Inserting a second large-bore IV ensures adequate access for fluid and blood administration. Administering PRBCs addresses the hemoglobin deficit and improves oxygen-carrying capacity. Elevating the legs promotes venous return and increases preload. Vasopressors are generally used after fluid resuscitation to address persistent hypotension.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of interventions can delay stabilization and worsen the patient's condition. Delaying direct pressure prolongs bleeding. Administering fluids or blood without adequate IV access slows resuscitation. Using vasopressors before addressing volume depletion can exacerbate tissue hypoperfusion. Leg elevation alone is insufficient to address significant volume loss.",

      "trap": "Many students prioritize fluid resuscitation (IV access, PRBCs) before addressing the source of the bleed, failing to recognize that uncontrolled hemorrhage will negate the benefits of fluid replacement.",
      "howToOvercome": "Focus on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and remember that stopping the bleeding is the most immediate priority in a patient with hemorrhage. Consider what is happening to the patient and how each intervention will effect the patient's immediate presentation."

    "sbar": "S: John Doe, a 62-year-old male, was admitted with a GI bleed and a recent fall resulting in a laceration to his left forearm. His Hemoglobin (Hgb) was 10.2 this morning. B: His past medical history includes hypertension (HTN) and coronary artery disease (CAD). A: At 07:00, the patient reported dizziness and weakness. His vital signs were concerning: blood pressure (BP) 88/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 122 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 26 breaths/min, and SpO2 92% on room air. The dressing on his forearm was saturated with blood. He appeared pale and diaphoretic but remained alert and oriented to person, place, and time. At 07:05, the physician was notified and ordered 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and a stat complete blood count (CBC). O: We are continuing to assess the patient and implement interventions as ordered. We will monitor vital signs every 15 minutes and anticipate the need for further interventions based on the patient's response to treatment. At 07:10, we are initiating IV access for blood administration.",
