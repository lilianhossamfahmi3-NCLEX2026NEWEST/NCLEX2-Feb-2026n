    "correct": "The patient's acute rise in creatinine and BUN, coupled with decreased urine output, indicates acute kidney injury (AKI). The elevated potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L is a critical electrolyte imbalance requiring immediate intervention. The peaked T waves on the EKG are indicative of hyperkalemia. Calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Selecting other options indicates a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of AKI and hyperkalemia. While CKD is a possibility, the acute rise in creatinine points towards AKI. While hyponatremia and fluid overload can occur in renal failure, hyperkalemia presents the most immediate threat to the patient's life given the impact on cardiac function. Furosemide could be considered, but calcium gluconate directly addresses the immediate risk of hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmias.",

Reports poor oral intake in the last few days. B: Patient’s BP is 170/95, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. EKG shows peaked T waves, concerning for hyperkalemia. Last BM was 3 days ago. 0700 Labs drawn revealed critical values. A: Currently assessing patient and closely monitoring cardiac status due to hyperkalemia. Notified provider of lab results and EKG findings. Implementing oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Awaiting further orders, particularly regarding potassium management. 0730: New lab results are concerning, indicating acute kidney injury and severe hyperkalemia.
