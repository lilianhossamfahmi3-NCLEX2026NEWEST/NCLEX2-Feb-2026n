    "correct": "The correct order of interventions is:\n1. Establish two large-bore IV lines: Rapid fluid resuscitation and medication administration are critical in managing postpartum hemorrhage and potential complications of preeclampsia.\n2. Assess fundal tone and perform fundal massage: Addressing uterine atony, a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, is paramount.\n3. Initiate Magnesium Sulfate IV: Given the elevated BP and other signs of preeclampsia (headache, proteinuria), seizure prophylaxis is essential.\n4. Administer Methylergonovine 0.2mg IM: This uterotonic medication helps contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. However, it is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure; benefits outweigh the risks at this point. Monitor BP closely.\n5. Prepare for possible blood transfusion: The low hemoglobin level indicates significant blood loss, necessitating preparation for possible transfusion.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences demonstrate a lack of understanding of the urgency and prioritization of interventions in managing postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia. For instance, administering methylergonovine before addressing the fundal tone or establishing IV access delays crucial interventions. Delaying magnesium sulfate administration in the presence of elevated BP increases the risk of seizures.",

    "sbar": "Situation: Maria Rodriguez, a 32-year-old female, G1P1, delivered vaginally at 02:00 this morning. She is now experiencing postpartum hemorrhage and suspected preeclampsia. Background: Patient has a history of gestational hypertension, which resolved during pregnancy. Assessment: At 08:00, the patient reports increasing vaginal bleeding and a severe headache. Her fundus is boggy and displaced, with heavy lochia rubra and clots. Blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 22, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Pending labs showed elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria in previous readings. The patient is alert but visibly anxious and distressed. Recommendation: I am requesting immediate orders for the management of postpartum hemorrhage and possible preeclampsia, including continuous monitoring, fluid resuscitation, and potential medication administration to stabilize her condition.",
