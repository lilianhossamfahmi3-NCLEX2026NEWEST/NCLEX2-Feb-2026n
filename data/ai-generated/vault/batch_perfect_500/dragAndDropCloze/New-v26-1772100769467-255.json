        "correct": "Immediately after delivery, the fundus should be firm and midline. This indicates that the uterine muscles are contracting effectively to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. After 24 hours, the fundus descends approximately 1 cm every 24 hours due to uterine involution, the process where the uterus returns to its pre-pregnant size. By the 10th postpartum day, the fundus should no longer be palpable in the abdomen, indicating that involution is progressing normally. Failure of the fundus to descend as expected could indicate subinvolution, potentially leading to complications such as postpartum hemorrhage or infection.",
