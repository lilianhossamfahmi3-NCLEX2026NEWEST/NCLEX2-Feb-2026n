    "correct": "The correct order of interventions is based on the immediate need to improve oxygenation and bronchodilation. Administering oxygen is the priority to address hypoxemia. Administering a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol is the next step to relieve bronchospasm. Administering an anticholinergic agent like ipratropium provides additional bronchodilation. Assessing the patient's response to treatment is crucial to determine the effectiveness of the interventions and guide further management. Administering systemic corticosteroids helps reduce airway inflammation, but it is not the immediate priority.",
