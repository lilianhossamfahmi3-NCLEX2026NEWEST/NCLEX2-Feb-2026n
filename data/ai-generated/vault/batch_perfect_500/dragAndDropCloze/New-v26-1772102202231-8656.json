She received routine prenatal care and had no known risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage.\n\nAssessment: The patient's uterus is boggy and not contracting effectively. There is excessive vaginal bleeding, saturating a pad in 15 minutes. Vital signs: HR 110 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 20, SpO2 96% on room air.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend initiating postpartum hemorrhage protocol, including fundal massage, administration of uterotonic medications, and continuous monitoring of vital signs.

        "correct": "Uterine atony, retained placental fragments, and lacerations of the birth canal are all risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage because they interfere with the uterus's ability to contract effectively and control bleeding after delivery. Fundal massage stimulates uterine contractions to help control bleeding. Uterotonic medications, such as oxytocin, help the uterus contract. Assessing vital signs helps monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and detect early signs of hypovolemic shock.",

            "Uterotonic medications such as oxytocin, misoprostol, and methylergonovine are commonly used to contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. Monitor for side effects such as hypertension with methylergonovine."

        "questionTrap": "Some options may seem plausible but are not the most direct risk factors or interventions for postpartum hemorrhage. Focus on the immediate needs of the patient and the underlying causes of the bleeding. For example, while early ambulation and ice pack application are important postpartum interventions, they do not directly address or manage postpartum hemorrhage.",
