        "correct": "The correct order addresses the potential causes of late decelerations and promotes fetal oxygenation. Repositioning the mother improves blood flow to the uterus and placenta, alleviating potential compression of the vena cava. Administering oxygen increases the oxygen available to the fetus, compensating for reduced placental oxygen transfer. Increasing the IV fluid rate addresses potential hypovolemia, which can compromise placental perfusion. Notifying the provider ensures timely assessment and further intervention if needed, including consideration of delivery. Continuous fetal monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions.",
