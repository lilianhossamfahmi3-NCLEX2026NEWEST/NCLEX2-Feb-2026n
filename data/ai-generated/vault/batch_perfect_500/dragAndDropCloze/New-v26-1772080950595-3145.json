        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate respiratory support, followed by diagnostic testing, medication administration, and further assessment. Providing supplemental oxygen addresses the patient's hypoxemia by increasing the available oxygen to saturate hemoglobin. Obtaining a chest x-ray helps determine the underlying cause of the respiratory distress, such as pneumonia or a foreign body. Administering an antipyretic reduces fever, decreasing metabolic demand and improving comfort. Reassessing respiratory status evaluates the effectiveness of interventions and guides further treatment adjustments. Continuous monitoring ensures the patient's condition is improving and prevents potential complications.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment of respiratory distress. For example, delaying oxygen administration can worsen hypoxemia, leading to potential organ damage. Administering medication before assessing the underlying cause may mask critical signs and symptoms, hindering accurate diagnosis. Reassessing before interventions provides no benefit without action, wasting valuable time in a critical situation.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "why": "Fever management is important, but addressing hypoxemia and respiratory distress takes precedence. Prioritizing interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) is crucial in emergency situations.",
            "commonMistake": "Students may incorrectly prioritize medication administration (e.g., antipyretics) before addressing the immediate respiratory distress, overlooking the urgency of stabilizing the patient's respiratory status."
