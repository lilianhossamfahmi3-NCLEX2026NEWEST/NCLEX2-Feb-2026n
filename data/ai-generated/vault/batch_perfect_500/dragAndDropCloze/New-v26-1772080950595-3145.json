    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate respiratory support, followed by diagnostic testing, medication administration, and further assessment.  Providing supplemental oxygen addresses the patient's hypoxemia. Obtaining a chest x-ray helps determine the underlying cause of the respiratory distress. Administering an antipyretic reduces fever and improves comfort. Reassessing respiratory status evaluates the effectiveness of interventions.",
