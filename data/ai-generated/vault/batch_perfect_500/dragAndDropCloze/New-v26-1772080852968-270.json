        "correct": "Assessing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is always the priority in any patient encounter. This ensures immediate life-threatening issues are addressed. Obtaining IV access allows for administration of fluids and medications, crucial for managing fever and potential dehydration. Administering antipyretics helps reduce fever and improve comfort, preventing febrile seizures. Obtaining lab samples aids in diagnosis, ruling out infections or inflammatory conditions. Consulting with a pediatric rheumatology specialist can provide expert guidance in managing the patient's condition, especially if rheumatic fever or other autoimmune disorders are suspected.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rapid assessment and intervention are critical in pediatric patients due to their limited physiological reserves.\nquestionTrap: Prioritizing interventions like lab draws or specialist consults before stabilizing the patient's ABCs can lead to rapid deterioration.\nmnemonic: ABCDE - Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure.
