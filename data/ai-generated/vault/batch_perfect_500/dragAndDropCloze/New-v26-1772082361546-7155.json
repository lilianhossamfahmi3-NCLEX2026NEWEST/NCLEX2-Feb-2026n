        "correct": "The correct order is:\n1.  **Administer calcium gluconate:** Calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane, protecting against the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart, preventing arrhythmias. It does not lower potassium levels but provides immediate cardiac protection.\n2.  **Administer regular insulin with dextrose:** Insulin shifts potassium into the cells, lowering serum potassium levels. Dextrose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells along with potassium.\n3.  **Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate):** Kayexalate binds to potassium in the GI tract, promoting its excretion through the feces. This is a slower-acting method for potassium removal and is not suitable for acute, severe hyperkalemia.\n4.  **Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if other measures are ineffective and the patient has persistent, severe hyperkalemia:** CRRT is used as a last resort when other measures fail to reduce potassium levels, especially in patients with AKI or CKD. It provides continuous potassium removal.",

            "description": "A helpful mnemonic is 'C BIG K Drop':\nC: Calcium Gluconate (cardiac protection)\nB: Bicarbonate (may be used to shift K+ into cells)\nI: Insulin\nG: Glucose\nK: Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate)\nDrop: Dialysis (for severe cases).",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect order indicates a lack of understanding of the urgency and mechanism of action for each intervention in treating hyperkalemia. Prioritizing slower or less effective treatments over immediate life-saving measures, or giving a definitive treatment before temporizing/stabilizing treatments, is incorrect and could lead to patient harm. For example, administering Kayexalate before calcium gluconate does not address the immediate risk of cardiac arrhythmias.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "whyWrong": "Failing to recognize the emergent need for cardiac protection in hyperkalemia can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Prioritizing potassium removal without stabilizing the cardiac membrane can be fatal.",
            "commonMistake": "A common mistake is to administer Kayexalate before calcium gluconate. While Kayexalate helps remove potassium, it takes time to work (hours to days). Calcium gluconate provides immediate protection to the heart (minutes)."

            "ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS, prolonged PR interval) are important indicators of hyperkalemia severity and guide treatment urgency.",

            "Kayexalate can cause constipation or, rarely, bowel necrosis; consider administering with a stool softener and monitoring for abdominal symptoms.",
            "CRRT is a more definitive treatment for hyperkalemia, removing potassium directly from the blood, but is typically reserved for severe or refractory cases due to its invasiveness and resource requirements."
