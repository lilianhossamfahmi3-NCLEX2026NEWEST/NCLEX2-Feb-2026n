He reports recent use of NSAIDs for back pain. Labs drawn in the ED show elevated creatinine and potassium.\n**A**ssessment: Patient is alert and oriented. His potassium level is critically elevated at 7.0 mEq/L. ECG shows peaked T waves.

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct order is:\n1.  **Administer calcium gluconate:** Calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane, protecting against the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart.\n2.  **Administer regular insulin with dextrose:** Insulin shifts potassium into the cells, lowering serum potassium levels. Dextrose is given to prevent hypoglycemia.\n3.  **Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate):** Kayexalate binds to potassium in the GI tract, promoting its excretion through the feces. This is a slower-acting method for potassium removal.\n4.  **Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if other measures are ineffective and the patient has persistent, severe hyperkalemia:** CRRT is used as a last resort when other measures fail to reduce potassium levels, especially in patients with AKI or CKD.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect order indicates a lack of understanding of the urgency and mechanism of action for each intervention in treating hyperkalemia. Prioritizing slower or less effective treatments over immediate life-saving measures, or giving a definitive treatment before temporizing/stabilizing treatments, is incorrect and could lead to patient harm.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS) are important indicators of hyperkalemia severity.",
      "Always monitor glucose levels closely after administering insulin.",
      "Kayexalate can cause constipation; consider administering with a stool softener.",
      "CRRT is a more definitive treatment for hyperkalemia, removing potassium directly from the blood, but is typically reserved for severe or refractory cases."
    ],
    "questionTrap": {
      "commonMistake": "A common mistake is to administer Kayexalate before calcium gluconate. While Kayexalate helps remove potassium, it takes time to work. Calcium gluconate provides immediate protection to the heart.",
      "whyWrong": "Failing to recognize the emergent need for cardiac protection in hyperkalemia can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest."
