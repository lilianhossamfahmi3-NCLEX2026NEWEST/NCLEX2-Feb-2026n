        "correct": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it reverses bronchospasm, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability. Oxygen administration addresses hypoxemia, ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Monitoring vital signs provides essential data to assess the patient's response to treatment and guide further interventions. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids are secondary treatments to address histamine release and inflammation, respectively. These medications help manage the allergic response but are not the priority in the acute phase of anaphylaxis.",

        "incorrect": "Delaying epinephrine can lead to rapid deterioration and potential respiratory arrest. Oxygen is essential for improving SpO2 and addressing hypoxemia. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids, while helpful in managing allergic symptoms, are not the immediate priority in an anaphylactic reaction where airway and breathing are compromised. Continuous vital sign monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety and effectiveness of the interventions, allowing for timely adjustments to the treatment plan.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reasoning": "Students may focus on the visible symptoms (urticaria) and forget the life-threatening respiratory compromise requiring immediate epinephrine administration. Recognizing the systemic nature of anaphylaxis and the potential for rapid deterioration is crucial.",
