Parent reports known peanut allergy but unsure if patient ingested cookies. \nB: Patient has a known peanut allergy. No prior history of anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. \nA: Patient is currently exhibiting signs of a moderate allergic reaction, including urticaria, angioedema (lip swelling), and mild respiratory distress. Vital signs are being obtained. \nR: I recommend immediate administration of epinephrine, monitoring of vital signs, and preparation for potential intubation.",

    "correct": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis to reverse bronchospasm, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability. Oxygen administration addresses hypoxemia. Monitoring vital signs provides essential data to assess the patient's response to treatment and guide further interventions. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids are secondary treatments to address histamine release and inflammation, respectively.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying epinephrine can lead to rapid deterioration and potential respiratory arrest. Oxygen is essential for improving SpO2. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids, while helpful, are not the immediate priority in an anaphylactic reaction. Continuous vital sign monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety and effectiveness of the interventions.",
