    "correct": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis to reverse bronchospasm, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability. Oxygen administration addresses hypoxemia. Monitoring vital signs provides essential data to assess the patient's response to treatment and guide further interventions. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids are secondary treatments to address histamine release and inflammation, respectively.",

    "incorrect": "Delaying epinephrine can lead to rapid deterioration and potential respiratory arrest. Oxygen is essential for improving SpO2.

Continuous vital sign monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety and effectiveness of the interventions.",
