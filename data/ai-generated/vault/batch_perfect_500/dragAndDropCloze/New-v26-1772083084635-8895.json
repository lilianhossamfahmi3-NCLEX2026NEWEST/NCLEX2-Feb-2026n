Effective pain management enables the patient to engage in other essential postpartum activities. 2. Assess fundus and lochia: Regular assessment is crucial for monitoring uterine involution and detecting potential postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of maternal morbidity. 3. Educate on perineal care and hygiene: Providing education on proper perineal care and hygiene practices minimizes the risk of infection and supports the healing process. 4. Encourage breastfeeding every 2-3 hours: Breastfeeding supports infant nutrition and stimulates uterine contractions, aiding in uterine involution. 5. Monitor vital signs: Routine monitoring of vital signs allows for the early detection of any potential complications, such as infection or hemorrhage.",
