Assess fundus and lochia:  Essential to monitor uterine involution and identify potential postpartum hemorrhage. 3. Educate on perineal care and hygiene: Reduces the risk of infection and promotes healing. 4. Encourage breastfeeding every 2-3 hours: Supports infant nutrition and uterine involution. 5. Monitor vital signs: Routine assessment to detect any early signs of complications.",
