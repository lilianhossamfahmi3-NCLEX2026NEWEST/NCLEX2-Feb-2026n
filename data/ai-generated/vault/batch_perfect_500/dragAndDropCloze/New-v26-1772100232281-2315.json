        "correct": "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or resistance to its effects, leading to an inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine. This results in the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine, causing decreased urine specific gravity. The excessive loss of free water leads to increased serum osmolality as the concentration of solutes in the blood increases. Consequently, serum sodium levels also rise (hypernatremia) due to the relative water deficit.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of dehydration, such as poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and orthostatic hypotension, in patients with DI. Rapid correction of hypernatremia can lead to cerebral edema, so treatment should be gradual.\n\nmnemonic: 'DI' = 'Dry Inside' (high serum osmolality and sodium) and 'Dilute Urine'.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options suggest a different fluid balance status than what is expected in diabetes insipidus. For example, increased urine specific gravity would indicate concentrated urine, which is not seen in this condition. Decreased serum osmolality and hyponatremia would suggest fluid overload or SIADH, where the body retains excessive water.\n\nquestionTrap: Students may confuse diabetes insipidus with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone), which presents with opposite findings (low serum osmolality, hyponatremia, and concentrated urine).",
