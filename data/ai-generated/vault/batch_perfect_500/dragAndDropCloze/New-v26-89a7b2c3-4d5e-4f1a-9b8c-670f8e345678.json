    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium of 6.8 mEq/L, weakness, nausea, and peaked T waves on EKG - all inferred from the SBAR). Given the decreased urine output, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and a GFR of 35 mL/min, the most likely underlying cause is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) superimposed on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The priority nursing intervention is to administer medications to reduce the serum potassium level (e.g., calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, insulin/dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly, and/or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body). The patient is at high risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias due to the hyperkalemia, potentially leading to cardiac arrest; therefore, continuous cardiac monitoring, including frequent assessment of EKG changes, is crucial.",

    "sbar": "S: Johnathan Doe, 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, admitted two days ago for pneumonia. He is now reporting increased weakness, generalized nausea, and a feeling of being unwell. O: 0700: Patient is alert but lethargic. Blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally. 0715: Noted new onset of bilateral lower extremity edema (2+ pitting). Urine output has been significantly decreased over the last 12 hours, totaling only 40 mL. EKG shows peaked T waves. A: Possible Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) superimposed on underlying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) exacerbation. High concern for hyperkalemia given the EKG findings and lab trends. B: Patient's chronic conditions are hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with lisinopril and metformin respectively. He also uses an albuterol inhaler PRN for mild wheezing. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, inhaled albuterol, famotidine and ceftriaxone. Pending lab results are being closely monitored, and the physician has been notified immediately regarding the changes in patient status.",
