Common causes include mucus plugging, biting the endotracheal tube, or kinks in the ventilator tubing. A tension pneumothorax requires immediate intervention, such as a needle thoracostomy, to relieve pressure on the lung and mediastinum. Prevention of VAP is crucial and includes elevating the head of the bed and providing meticulous oral care.",

B: Mr. Miller has a history of COPD, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was intubated post-operatively due to increasing respiratory distress. A: He is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His current SpO2 is 92%, heart rate is 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg. The high-pressure alarm on the ventilator is sounding intermittently. Increased agitation has been noted. Upon auscultation, diminished breath sounds are present on the right side. His central venous pressure (CVP) is trending upward. C: I am concerned about a possible pneumothorax or obstruction of the airway. I am requesting orders for a STAT chest x-ray and an assessment for possible suctioning or other interventions to address the airway obstruction. Please advise on further management.",
