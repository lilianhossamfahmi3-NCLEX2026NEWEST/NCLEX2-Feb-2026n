    "correct": "Assessing for suicidal ideation and plan is the FIRST priority to determine the immediate risk of self-harm. Initiating suicide precautions is SECOND, ensuring patient safety by removing potentially harmful objects and constant observation. Contacting the on-call psychiatrist is THIRD to obtain a formal mental health evaluation and treatment plan. Administering prescribed PRN lorazepam is FOURTH to manage acute anxiety symptoms *after* assessing suicide risk and ensuring safety. Encouraging verbalization of feelings is LAST because while supportive, it is not the immediate priority when assessing suicide risk.",
