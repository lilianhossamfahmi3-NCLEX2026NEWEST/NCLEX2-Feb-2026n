    "correct": "The correct order of actions is based on immediate life-threatening concerns and diagnostic priorities in suspected acute coronary syndrome. Applying oxygen addresses potential hypoxia. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Obtaining an ECG is crucial for diagnosing myocardial ischemia or infarction. Administering aspirin helps prevent further thrombus formation. Administering morphine addresses pain and reduces preload. Preparing for cardiac catheterization is the definitive treatment for STEMI or high-risk NSTEMI. Notifying the physician is important, but only after initial actions are taken.",
