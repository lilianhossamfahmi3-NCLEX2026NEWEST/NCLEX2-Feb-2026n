        "correct": "The correct order of actions is based on immediate life-threatening concerns and diagnostic priorities in suspected acute coronary syndrome. Applying oxygen addresses potential hypoxia, ensuring adequate tissue perfusion. Establishing IV access allows for rapid medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Obtaining an ECG is crucial for diagnosing myocardial ischemia or infarction, guiding further treatment. Administering aspirin helps prevent further thrombus formation, reducing the risk of complete arterial occlusion. Administering morphine addresses pain and reduces preload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Preparing for cardiac catheterization is the definitive treatment for STEMI or high-risk NSTEMI, aiming to restore blood flow. Notifying the physician is important, but only after initial actions are taken to stabilize the patient and gather essential diagnostic information.",

            "name": "MONA",
            "description": "Mnemonic for initial treatment of acute coronary syndrome: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin (although Aspirin is usually given first in practice). This helps remember the initial interventions but doesn't cover all necessary actions. Remember to also consider ECG and cardiac catheterization."
        },
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences may delay critical interventions or prioritize less urgent actions. For example, notifying the physician before applying oxygen or obtaining an ECG would delay crucial diagnostic and therapeutic measures, potentially leading to increased myocardial damage and poorer patient outcomes.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "whyTrapping": "The question traps students by requiring them to prioritize actions based on a complex interplay of assessment, intervention, and communication, demanding a deep understanding of the management of acute coronary syndrome. Students must differentiate between immediate life-saving measures and subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic steps.",
            "commonMistakes": "Students may incorrectly prioritize actions based on memorization rather than understanding the underlying pathophysiology and clinical urgency. They might also confuse the order of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, such as administering pain medication before assessing oxygen saturation or obtaining an ECG."

            "Time is muscle; prompt recognition and treatment of myocardial infarction are crucial to minimizing myocardial damage and improving patient outcomes. Aim for rapid ECG acquisition and initiation of appropriate therapies.",
            "The initial focus should be on stabilizing the patient, obtaining diagnostic data, and initiating appropriate medical therapies. This includes addressing airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as pain management and prevention of further thrombus formation."
