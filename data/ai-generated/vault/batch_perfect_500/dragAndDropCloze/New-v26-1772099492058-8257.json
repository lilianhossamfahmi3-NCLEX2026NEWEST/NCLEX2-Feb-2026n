        "correct": "Sepsis is triggered by an infection, leading to inflammation and potential organ damage. Prompt antibiotic administration and fluid resuscitation are vital to combat the infection and support organ function. The body's immune response, when dysregulated, causes systemic inflammation, leading to tissue hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ failure. Early intervention with antibiotics targets the source of infection, while fluid resuscitation helps maintain adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion. This combined approach aims to prevent the progression to septic shock and improve patient survival rates.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of septic shock, including persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and elevated lactate levels.\nquestionTrap: Selecting vasopressors as the initial intervention before fluid resuscitation can worsen tissue perfusion in hypovolemic patients.\nmnemonic: SIRS - Source identification, Infection control, Resuscitation (fluids), Support organ function.",
