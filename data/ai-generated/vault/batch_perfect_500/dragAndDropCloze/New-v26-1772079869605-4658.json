        "correct": "An increase in preload causes fluid backup into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to pulmonary edema. The S3 gallop is caused by increased afterload on the left ventricle, resulting in ventricular strain and turbulent blood flow during rapid ventricular filling. Reduced cardiac output due to impaired contractility leads to renal hypoperfusion, stimulating the release of BNP from the ventricles. Increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries forces fluid out of the vessels and into the interstitial space, causing peripheral edema.\n\n",
