        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is based on the immediate need to improve oxygenation and bronchodilation. Administering oxygen is the priority to address hypoxemia. Administering a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol helps to quickly reverse bronchospasm. Administering an anticholinergic like ipratropium provides additional bronchodilation. Administering systemic corticosteroids reduces airway inflammation. Monitoring respiratory status is continuous but follows the initial interventions.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can delay effective treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. Administering medications before ensuring adequate oxygenation can be detrimental. Delaying bronchodilators can prolong bronchospasm. Administering corticosteroids before bronchodilators may not provide immediate relief. Monitoring alone without intervention is insufficient.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may prioritize interventions based on familiarity or ease of administration rather than the urgency of the patient's needs. Some may prioritize corticosteroids too early, not understanding the need for immediate bronchodilation.",
