        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is based on the immediate need to improve oxygenation and bronchodilation. Administering oxygen is the priority to address hypoxemia. Administering a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol helps to quickly reverse bronchospasm. Administering an anticholinergic like ipratropium provides additional bronchodilation. Administering systemic corticosteroids reduces airway inflammation. Monitoring respiratory status is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",
