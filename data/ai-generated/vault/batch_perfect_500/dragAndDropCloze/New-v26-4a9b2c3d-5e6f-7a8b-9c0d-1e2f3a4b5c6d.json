    "correct": "1. Mannitol: Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce cerebral edema by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the bloodstream, thereby decreasing ICP. It is a first-line treatment for elevated ICP. 2. 30-45: Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps to reduce ICP. This is a fundamental nursing intervention. 3. Stool Softeners: Preventing straining during bowel movements is crucial because the Valsalva maneuver increases ICP. Stool softeners, such as docusate, ease bowel movements and prevent straining. 4. Blood Pressure: Maintaining adequate blood pressure is vital to ensure cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is sufficient to perfuse the brain. CPP is calculated as MAP - ICP. Both hypertension and hypotension can worsen outcomes; therefore, close monitoring and management are essential. 5. Loud Noises: A calm environment minimizes external stimuli that can exacerbate ICP. Reducing stimulation helps to prevent increases in ICP.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of ICP management or prioritization. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and less effective than Mannitol for immediate ICP reduction in this context. Elevating the head of the bed to an incorrect angle (e.g., 60-90 degrees) will not optimize venous drainage and may compromise cerebral perfusion. Addressing seizures is important in neurological patients but is secondary to reducing cerebral edema and preventing straining in the immediate management of increased ICP. Neglecting blood pressure management and environmental stimuli can potentially worsen the patient's condition.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "Students may prioritize seizure prevention or blood pressure control over immediate reduction of cerebral edema, overlooking the acute threat of increased ICP. They might also confuse different angles for head elevation or the appropriate diuretic.",
      "howToOvercome": "Focus on the immediate threat to the patient's neurological status. Prioritize interventions that directly address increased ICP, followed by measures to prevent secondary complications. Remember that mannitol is the preferred diuretic in this setting, and head elevation to 30-45 degrees is the standard recommendation."

    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the Medical ICU at 03:00 presenting with acute onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech. His initial NIHSS score was 18. He received intravenous tPA at 03:45, within the therapeutic window for thrombolytic intervention following the onset of stroke symptoms. B: The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with oral medications at home. He denies any known drug allergies. A: At 07:00, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 12 (E3, V4, M5), indicating a decline in neurological status. His left pupil is 3mm and reactive to light, while the right pupil is 5mm and sluggishly reactive. His blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg, heart rate is 60 bpm, respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute and regular, and SpO2 is 95% on 2L NC. The patient had one episode of emesis at 06:45. R: I am concerned about the patient's increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) given the change in GCS, asymmetrical pupillary response, and elevated blood pressure. He requires immediate neurological assessment by the neurocritical care team and continuous ICP monitoring if indicated. Strict blood pressure management is crucial to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). We should also consider further imaging to rule out hemorrhagic conversion. Please evaluate and advise on further management.",
