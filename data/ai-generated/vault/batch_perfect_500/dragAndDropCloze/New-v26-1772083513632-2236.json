        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes immediate interventions to address the postpartum hemorrhage. Assessing the fundus and massaging it is crucial to contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. Notifying the provider ensures timely intervention and further orders. Administering uterotonic medications helps to contract the uterus. Monitoring vital signs provides ongoing assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status. Documenting findings is essential for communication and continuity of care. Fundal massage stimulates uterine contractions, reducing blood flow. Uterotonics like oxytocin or methylergonovine further aid in uterine contraction. Continuous monitoring of vital signs helps detect hypovolemic shock early. Accurate documentation ensures all care providers are aware of the patient's status and interventions.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing may delay critical interventions and compromise patient safety. For example, documenting before assessing the fundus delays addressing the cause of the bleeding. Delaying fundal massage can lead to continued blood loss. Waiting to notify the provider can delay critical medical interventions. Administering uterotonics without assessing the fundus may be ineffective if the uterus is not contracting. Failing to monitor vital signs can result in delayed recognition of hypovolemic shock.",
