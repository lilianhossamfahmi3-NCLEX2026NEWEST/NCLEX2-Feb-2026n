        "correct": "1. Obtain urine sample for urinalysis: Obtaining a urine sample is crucial to rule out a urinary tract infection (UTI), a common cause of fever in infants. Early detection and treatment of UTIs can prevent potential complications such as kidney damage. 2. Administer antipyretic medication as ordered: Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, help reduce fever and improve the infant's comfort. Reducing the fever can also decrease irritability and improve oral intake. 3. Initiate oral rehydration therapy: Mild dehydration is evident from the dry mucous membranes and decreased urine output. Oral rehydration therapy helps restore fluid balance and prevent further dehydration. Small, frequent amounts of oral rehydration solution are typically recommended. 4. Monitor vital signs and hydration status closely: Continuous monitoring of vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate) and hydration status (urine output, mucous membranes, skin turgor) is essential to assess the infant's response to interventions and detect any deterioration or complications.",
