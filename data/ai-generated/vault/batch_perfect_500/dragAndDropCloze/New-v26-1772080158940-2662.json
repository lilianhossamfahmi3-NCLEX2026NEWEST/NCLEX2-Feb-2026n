        "correct": "Rapid neurological assessment and CT scan are crucial for determining eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. If no hemorrhage is present, alteplase (tPA) is the standard of care for ischemic stroke within the appropriate time window. Maintaining blood pressure within the permissive hypertension range is important to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion. Permissive hypertension allows for increased blood flow to the penumbral region, potentially salvaging ischemic tissue. The timeframe for alteplase administration is typically within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset, depending on institutional guidelines and patient-specific factors.",

        "incorrect": "Administering aspirin before confirming the type of stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic) can be harmful, as it can exacerbate bleeding in a hemorrhagic stroke. Permissive hypotension is not appropriate in acute stroke; maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to ensure cerebral perfusion. Waiting for lab results before ordering a CT scan delays diagnosis and potential treatment, increasing the risk of irreversible brain damage. Aspirin is typically administered after a CT scan rules out hemorrhage and confirms an ischemic event.",
