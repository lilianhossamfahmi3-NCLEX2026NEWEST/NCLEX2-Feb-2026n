        "correct": "Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin analog that mimics the action of ADH, promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys. This can lead to excessive water retention and dilutional hyponatremia (low serum sodium). Hyponatremia can cause fluid to shift into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema. Symptoms of cerebral edema include headache, confusion, nausea, and, in severe cases, seizures and coma.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor serum sodium levels closely, especially after the initial dose of desmopressin. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can also be dangerous, so gradual correction is preferred.\n\nquestionTrap: Students may focus on the client's diabetes insipidus and dehydration, overlooking the potential complication of hyponatremia caused by desmopressin.\n\nmnemonic: \"SiADH\" - Syndrome of Inappropriate Desmopressin (ADH). Remember to watch for low sodium levels.",
        "incorrect": "Hypernatremia is not a typical side effect of desmopressin. Desmopressin promotes water retention, not dehydration. Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are not directly related to desmopressin administration.
