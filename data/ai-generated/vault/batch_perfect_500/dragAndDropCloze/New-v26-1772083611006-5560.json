        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes interventions to address the patient's respiratory distress and improve oxygenation. Administering oxygen addresses immediate hypoxemia by increasing the available oxygen to the tissues. Administering a bronchodilator (albuterol/ipratropium) helps to open the airways by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle, reducing airway resistance. Monitoring respiratory status is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm. Finally, reassessing oxygen saturation and respiratory effort confirms the interventions' impact, ensuring the patient's respiratory status is improving.",
