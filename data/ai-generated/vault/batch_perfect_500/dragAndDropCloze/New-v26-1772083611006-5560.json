    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes interventions to address the patient's respiratory distress and improve oxygenation.  Administering oxygen addresses immediate hypoxemia. Administering a bronchodilator (albuterol/ipratropium) helps to open the airways. Monitoring respiratory status is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion.  Finally, reassessing oxygen saturation and respiratory effort confirms the interventions' impact.",
