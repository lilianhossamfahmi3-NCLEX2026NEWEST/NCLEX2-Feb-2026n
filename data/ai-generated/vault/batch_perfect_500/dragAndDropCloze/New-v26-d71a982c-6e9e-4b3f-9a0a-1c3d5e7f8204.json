        "correct": "Lactulose is prescribed to reduce ammonia levels in the blood, a key factor in hepatic encephalopathy. The goal is typically 2-3 soft bowel movements per day to eliminate ammonia. Restricting protein intake is crucial because protein breakdown produces ammonia. A high-carbohydrate diet spares protein breakdown and provides energy for liver regeneration. Monitoring for signs of increased bleeding is essential due to impaired clotting factor synthesis in liver failure.",

For example, suggesting a high-protein diet would worsen hepatic encephalopathy. Ignoring potential bleeding risks neglects the impaired clotting factor production associated with liver failure.

He initially presented with symptoms including ascites, jaundice, and altered mental status, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. B: The patient has a 30-year history of heavy alcohol consumption and was diagnosed with cirrhosis two years prior. Unfortunately, he has been non-compliant with previous treatment recommendations. A: The patient's condition has shown improvement with the administration of lactulose, diuretics, and consistent nutritional support. His mental status has improved to being oriented to person, place, and time (x3). The ascites has decreased significantly. Laboratory results are trending in a positive direction, although they remain outside the normal range. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98% on room air. 0700 labs were drawn. O: We are currently in the discharge planning phase. The patient has verbalized a clear understanding of his medication regimen and the importance of adhering to dietary restrictions. Family members are present to participate in the discharge teaching session. He is expected to be ready for discharge at 1400, pending the completion of the final medication reconciliation process.",
