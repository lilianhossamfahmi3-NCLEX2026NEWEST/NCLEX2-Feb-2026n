        "correct": "Fundal assessment frequency is crucial in the immediate postpartum period to monitor for hemorrhage. Assessing the fundus every 15 minutes allows for early detection of uterine atony. Massaging a boggy uterus stimulates uterine contraction, compressing blood vessels and reducing bleeding risk. Encouraging the client to void prevents bladder distention, which can displace the uterus and inhibit contraction. Excessive bleeding (postpartum hemorrhage) requires immediate intervention to prevent hypovolemic shock. \n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor vital signs closely during fundal assessments to detect early signs of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia and hypotension.\nquestionTrap: Confusing the frequency of fundal checks or prioritizing other interventions over fundal massage for a boggy uterus.\nmnemonic: \"Firm Fundus, Few Fluids\" – emphasizes the importance of a firm uterus and controlled lochia flow in postpartum recovery.",
