    "correct": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasize rapid identification and treatment. Measuring lactate levels helps assess the severity of tissue hypoperfusion. Obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics is crucial for identifying the causative organism. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour improves patient outcomes. Fluid resuscitation is initiated to address hypotension. If hypotension persists despite fluids, vasopressors are indicated. Continuous monitoring is essential to evaluate the patient's response to treatment.",
