        "correct": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasize rapid identification and treatment. Measuring lactate levels helps assess the severity of tissue hypoperfusion, guiding the need for further intervention. Obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics is crucial for identifying the causative organism and tailoring antibiotic therapy. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour improves patient outcomes by targeting potential pathogens early. Fluid resuscitation is initiated to address hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. If hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressors are indicated to maintain adequate blood pressure. Continuous monitoring is essential to evaluate the patient's response to treatment and adjust interventions as needed.\n",

        "incorrect": "Delaying any of these steps can negatively impact patient outcomes. Administering antibiotics before obtaining cultures can affect culture results and hinder accurate diagnosis. Failure to address hypotension promptly can lead to end-organ damage due to inadequate perfusion. Ignoring elevated lactate levels can mask the severity of the patient's condition and delay appropriate interventions. Vasopressors are typically used after fluid resuscitation fails to improve blood pressure adequately; using them prematurely can cause vasoconstriction without addressing the underlying hypovolemia.",
