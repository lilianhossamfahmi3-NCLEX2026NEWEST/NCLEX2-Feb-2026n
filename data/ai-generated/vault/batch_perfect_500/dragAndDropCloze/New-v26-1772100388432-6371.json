        "correct": "Oliguria is defined as low urine output, typically less than 400 mL in 24 hours, and is a common sign of AKI, indicating impaired kidney function. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the underlying cause of oliguria in AKI, as the kidneys are less able to filter waste and fluid from the blood. Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of AKI due to the kidneys' impaired ability to excrete potassium, leading to elevated potassium levels in the blood. The nurse must monitor for muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and EKG changes.",
