    "correct": "A potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L requires immediate intervention because furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Crackles in the lungs indicate fluid overload, which is a sign of worsening heart failure and requires intervention. A heart rate of 60 bpm, in the context of diuretic use, could indicate excessive fluid loss or medication side effect and warrants further assessment.",
    "incorrect": "A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is elevated but not immediately life-threatening in a patient with heart failure. Weight gain of 1 kg in 24 hours could indicate fluid retention, but it is not as urgent as hypokalemia or pulmonary edema. A sodium level of 140 mEq/L is within normal limits. An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is within normal limits.",

      "Monitor potassium levels closely in patients receiving loop diuretics.",
