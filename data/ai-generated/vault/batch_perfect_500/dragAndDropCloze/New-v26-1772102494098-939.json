        "correct": "A potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L requires immediate intervention because furosemide, a loop diuretic, can cause hypokalemia, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Crackles in the lungs indicate fluid overload and pulmonary edema, signs of worsening heart failure requiring immediate intervention. A heart rate of 60 bpm, in a patient on diuretics, could indicate excessive fluid loss or a medication side effect (hypotension) and warrants further assessment and intervention.",
        "incorrect": "A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is elevated but not immediately life-threatening in a patient with heart failure, especially if this is the patient's baseline. Weight gain of 1 kg in 24 hours could indicate fluid retention, but it is not as urgent as hypokalemia or pulmonary edema. A sodium level of 140 mEq/L is within normal limits. An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is within normal limits.",
