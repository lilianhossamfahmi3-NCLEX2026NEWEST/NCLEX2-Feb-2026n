Establishing IV access is crucial for administering fluids and medications. Administering antibiotics promptly is essential in suspected bacterial meningitis to prevent neurological damage and sepsis. Administering antipyretics helps to reduce fever, which can contribute to neurological compromise. Preparing the patient for a lumbar puncture is important for diagnosis, but should occur after stabilization. Finally, providing comfort measures such as dimming the lights and reducing noise will help minimize stimulation.",
