O: On examination, Mr. Jones has an SpO2 of 88% on room air, increased work of breathing with accessory muscle use, and audible wheezing. His respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and heart rate is 110 bpm. B: Mr. Jones has a 5-year history of COPD, managed with inhaled bronchodilators. He also has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He reports non-adherence to his COPD medications in the past week. A: Acute exacerbation of COPD, likely triggered by a respiratory infection. R: I recommend initiating oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 above 90%, administering bronchodilators such as albuterol and ipratropium via nebulizer, and starting systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation.
