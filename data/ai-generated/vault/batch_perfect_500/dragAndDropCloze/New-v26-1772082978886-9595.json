        "correct": "ST-segment elevation and elevated troponin levels are indicative of myocardial infarction. In myocardial infarction (STEMI), the abrupt blockage of a coronary artery leads to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, causing the release of troponin into the bloodstream and characteristic ST-segment elevation on ECG. Hypotension and weak pulses are consistent with cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart's pumping ability is severely compromised, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and manifesting as hypotension and diminished peripheral pulses. Unequal blood pressures between arms suggests aortic dissection. Aortic dissection involves a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, creating a false lumen and potentially obstructing blood flow to major arteries, resulting in blood pressure discrepancies between the arms.",

            "STEMI": "ST Elevation = Time for intervention Immediately"
        },
        "incorrect": "Stable angina is characterized by predictable chest pain relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Stable angina results from fixed coronary artery stenosis, causing chest pain during exertion that is relieved by rest or medication. Pericarditis typically presents with sharp chest pain that worsens with inspiration and is often relieved by sitting up. Pericarditis involves inflammation of the pericardium, leading to chest pain exacerbated by breathing and alleviated by positional changes. Heart failure is characterized by symptoms of fluid overload, such as edema and dyspnea. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid retention and associated symptoms.",

            "testTakingTip": "Carefully evaluate the patient's vital signs, EKG findings, and laboratory results to differentiate between various cardiovascular conditions.

            "commonMistakes": "Students may confuse stable angina with unstable angina or STEMI, or misinterpret the signs and symptoms of pericarditis and heart failure. Ensure a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of each condition to avoid these errors."
