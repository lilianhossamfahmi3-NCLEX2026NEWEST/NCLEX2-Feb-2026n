He is showing signs of possible sepsis.\nR: I recommend initiating sepsis protocols, including administering IV fluids, obtaining blood cultures, and starting broad-spectrum antibiotics. We should also consider the source of infection.",

Obtaining blood cultures before administering antibiotics helps identify the causative organism. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly is essential to combat the infection.
