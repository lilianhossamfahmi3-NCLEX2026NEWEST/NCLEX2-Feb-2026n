        "correct": "Rapid IV fluid resuscitation is crucial to address hypotension and improve tissue perfusion in sepsis. Obtaining blood cultures before administering antibiotics helps identify the causative organism and guides appropriate antibiotic selection. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly is essential to combat the infection while awaiting culture results. Measuring lactate levels helps assess tissue hypoxia and the severity of sepsis, guiding resuscitation efforts. Monitoring urine output helps assess kidney function and fluid balance, indicating the effectiveness of treatment and potential kidney injury.\n",

Administering antibiotics without obtaining blood cultures can hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment, potentially leading to antibiotic resistance.
