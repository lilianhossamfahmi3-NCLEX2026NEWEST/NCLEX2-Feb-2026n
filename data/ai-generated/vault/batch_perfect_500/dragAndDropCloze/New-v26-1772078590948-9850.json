        "correct": "The correct order is: 1. Administer calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane. Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart, reducing the risk of arrhythmias. 2. Administer insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly. Insulin promotes potassium entry into cells, and dextrose prevents hypoglycemia. This combination provides a temporary reduction in serum potassium. 3. Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body. Kayexalate binds potassium in the gut, promoting its excretion through the feces. It takes several hours to have an effect. 4. Prepare for dialysis if other measures are ineffective. Dialysis is the most effective method for rapidly removing potassium but is typically reserved for patients with severe hyperkalemia or kidney failure.",
