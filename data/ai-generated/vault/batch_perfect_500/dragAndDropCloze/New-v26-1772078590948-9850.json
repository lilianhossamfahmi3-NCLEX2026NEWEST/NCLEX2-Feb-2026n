He was admitted for routine monitoring but his potassium level has been steadily increasing.\nA: Potassium level is critically high at 6.8 mEq/L. ECG shows peaked T waves. He is currently on telemetry monitoring.  Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr.\nR: I recommend immediate intervention to lower his potassium level, including calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose, and potentially sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Consider dialysis if these measures are ineffective.  Monitor ECG and potassium levels closely.",
