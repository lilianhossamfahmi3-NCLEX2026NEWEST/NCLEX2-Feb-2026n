    "correct": "The correct order of interventions is based on the immediate need to improve oxygenation and bronchodilation, followed by addressing inflammation and monitoring response. Administering oxygen is the priority to address hypoxemia. Administering a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol is the next step to relieve bronchospasm. Administering corticosteroids helps to reduce airway inflammation. Finally, monitoring the patient's response to treatment is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can delay critical interventions and worsen the patient's respiratory status. For example, delaying oxygen administration can lead to further hypoxemia and potential organ damage. Administering corticosteroids before bronchodilators may not provide immediate relief of bronchospasm.",
