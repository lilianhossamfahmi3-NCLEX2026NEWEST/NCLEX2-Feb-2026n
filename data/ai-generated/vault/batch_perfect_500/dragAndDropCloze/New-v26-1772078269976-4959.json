        "correct": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance), physical exam findings (dry skin, facial puffiness, delayed reflexes), and lab results (high TSH, low Free T4) are consistent with hypothyroidism. High TSH indicates the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, prompting the pituitary gland to release more TSH in an attempt to stimulate thyroid hormone production. Low Free T4 confirms the thyroid gland's inability to produce sufficient thyroid hormone. Weight gain occurs due to a slowed metabolism. Cold intolerance is due to decreased heat production. Bradycardia results from the overall slowing of bodily functions.",
