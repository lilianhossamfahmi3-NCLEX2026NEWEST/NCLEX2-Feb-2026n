Minimizing stimulation through spaced out care activities will help to prevent overstimulation. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt. Morphine is often administered to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant. Maintaining adequate hydration helps to prevent increased blood viscosity, which can exacerbate cyanosis.",

While providing constant stimulation may seem like a way to monitor the infant, it can actually increase their agitation and oxygen demand. Supine position increases venous return and can worsen the right-to-left shunt. Diuretics are contraindicated as they can lead to dehydration and increased blood viscosity, exacerbating the cyanosis. Normal saline bolus is not typically the first-line treatment for a Tet spell and may overload the infant's system.",

Liam was admitted at 1400 with increased cyanosis and respiratory distress. His O2 saturation is currently 78% on room air. He is irritable and crying. He received morphine 0.5mg IV at 1430 for pain and anxiety. HR is 160 bpm, RR is 50, and temp is 37.8°C. The cardiologist was notified and is aware that he is scheduled for surgical repair tomorrow morning. He has a peripheral IV in his left hand. He is NPO except for clear liquids. I'm concerned about his increasing cyanosis and risk for a hypercyanotic spell. Requesting orders for PRN oxygen and repeat morphine dose if needed. Any other recommendations?",
