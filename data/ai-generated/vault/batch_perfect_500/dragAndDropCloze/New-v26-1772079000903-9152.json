    "correct": "Prioritizing interventions for fluid overload in CKD requires a systematic approach.  First, administer diuretics (e.g., furosemide) to promote fluid excretion. Second, restrict sodium and fluid intake to reduce further fluid retention.  Third, elevate the patient's lower extremities to facilitate venous return and reduce edema. Fourth, diligently monitor fluid intake and output to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Fifth, educate the patient about daily weights and signs/symptoms of fluid overload to promote self-management. The final intervention is to prepare the patient for possible dialysis, as this may become necessary if other interventions are insufficient to manage the fluid overload and hyperkalemia.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect orderings misprioritize the urgency and impact of interventions. Delaying diuretic administration can worsen pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. Prioritizing patient education before addressing the immediate fluid overload does not effectively address the acute problem. Failing to prepare the patient for dialysis early may result in a delay in this life-saving intervention.",
