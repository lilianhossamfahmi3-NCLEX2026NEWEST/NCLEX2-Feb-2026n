Based on the assessment data and presented lab values, the priority nursing interventions are to:\n\n1. Establish [BLANK_1] with Sgt. Hayes to foster trust and open communication, acknowledging his service and sacrifice.\n2. Conduct a thorough [BLANK_2] assessment, utilizing a standardized tool, to determine the level of risk, explore suicidal ideation in detail, and identify any immediate threats.\n3. Implement [BLANK_3] precautions, collaborating with the security team, by removing any potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment and ensuring continuous observation.\n4. Initiate a [BLANK_4] referral for comprehensive mental health evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist and immediate consideration for crisis stabilization or inpatient treatment.",
