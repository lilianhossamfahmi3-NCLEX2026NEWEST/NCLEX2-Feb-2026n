        "correct": "The correct order of interventions prioritizes safety and assessment. Establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial for building trust and rapport, facilitating open communication. Initiating suicide precautions ensures the patient's immediate safety and prevents further harm. A thorough suicide risk assessment helps determine the severity and nature of the risk, guiding further interventions. Implementing medication safety protocol prevents future overdose attempts and ensures proper medication management. Developing a safety plan empowers the patient with coping strategies and resources to use during crises, promoting self-management and resilience.\n\nclinicalPearl: Continuous monitoring and reassessment are vital in suicide prevention. A multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, and other healthcare professionals is essential for comprehensive care.",

For example, conducting a risk assessment before establishing a therapeutic relationship might yield inaccurate information due to lack of trust. Delaying suicide precautions increases the risk of self-harm. Implementing medication safety without a risk assessment could miss underlying factors contributing to the overdose. A safety plan is most effective after a thorough assessment and therapeutic connection.\n\nquestionTrap: The question might trap you if you focus solely on the physical aspects of the overdose and neglect the psychological and safety needs of the patient.

Initial labs show elevated liver enzymes. He received activated charcoal in the ED at 03:30. He is now more alert and oriented to person, place, and time. At 07:00, he denies current suicidal ideation but admits to feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. Current GCS is 15.
