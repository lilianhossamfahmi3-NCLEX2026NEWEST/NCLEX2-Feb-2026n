Blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg requires intervention because it indicates hypotension, which can be exacerbated by furosemide. Urine output of 30 mL/hour requires intervention because it indicates inadequate kidney perfusion and potential dehydration due to excessive diuresis. Crackles auscultated in bilateral lung bases does NOT require intervention because it is an expected finding in heart failure. Heart rate of 72 bpm does NOT require intervention because it is within normal limits. Weight gain of 1 kg in 24 hours does NOT require intervention because it is not a significant weight gain and may be related to fluid retention from the heart failure itself.",
