        "correct": "A potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L requires immediate intervention because furosemide, a loop diuretic, can cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg requires immediate intervention as it indicates hypotension, which can be exacerbated by furosemide's diuretic effect, potentially leading to decreased organ perfusion. A urine output of 30 mL/hour requires immediate intervention because it suggests inadequate kidney perfusion and potential dehydration, possibly due to excessive diuresis from the furosemide. Crackles auscultated in bilateral lung bases, while indicative of fluid overload, do NOT necessarily require immediate intervention in a patient with heart failure unless accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress. A heart rate of 72 bpm does NOT require immediate intervention as it is within the normal range. A weight gain of 1 kg in 24 hours does NOT require immediate intervention as it may be related to fluid retention from heart failure, but should be monitored.",
