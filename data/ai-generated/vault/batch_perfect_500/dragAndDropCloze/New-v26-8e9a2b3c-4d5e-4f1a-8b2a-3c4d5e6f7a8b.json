        "correct": "The correct order of interventions reflects the immediate priorities in managing thyroid storm. Blocking thyroid hormone synthesis with a thionamide such as methimazole or propylthiouracil is paramount. Beta-blockers are crucial for managing the cardiovascular manifestations such as tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Cooling measures are necessary to combat the severe hyperthermia. Glucocorticoids are administered to prevent relative adrenal insufficiency and to inhibit the conversion of T4 to the more active T3. Finally, continuous monitoring for complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias is essential to promptly address any deterioration.",

Block enterohepatic circulation (bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine). 5. Bolster (IV fluids, oxygen, manage complications)"
        },
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of interventions can lead to adverse patient outcomes. Delaying the administration of antithyroid medications allows the excessive thyroid hormone levels to continue exerting their effects. Failing to address the cardiovascular symptoms with beta-blockers can exacerbate tachycardia and arrhythmias, potentially leading to cardiac decompensation. Neglecting hyperthermia can cause significant cellular damage. Omitting glucocorticoids can precipitate adrenal insufficiency. Inadequate monitoring can delay the detection and management of life-threatening complications.",

Vital signs: Temp 104.2°F (40.1°C), HR 180 bpm, BP 180/90 mmHg, RR 32, SpO2 94% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and coarse crackles. Patient is diaphoretic and restless. 0715: Patient is increasingly agitated and confused. Noted mild tremor. Thyroid panel from earlier today resulted with markedly elevated T3 and T4 levels. 0730: New onset atrial fibrillation noted on telemetry with a rapid ventricular response. Current medications include propylthiouracil (PTU) 150mg PO q6h, started yesterday. Assessment reveals exophthalmos and goiter. Patient's respiratory status is declining, requiring supplemental oxygen. I am concerned about possible thyroid storm with impending respiratory failure. Requesting immediate orders for further management including beta-blockers (esmolol preferred), cooling measures, glucocorticoids, and possible intubation if respiratory status worsens. Transfer to ICU may be necessary.",
