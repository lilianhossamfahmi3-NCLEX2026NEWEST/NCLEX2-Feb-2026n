        "correct": "Immediately after delivery, the fundus should be firm and midline. A firm fundus indicates that the uterine muscles are contracting effectively to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. A midline position ensures that the bladder is not distended, which can displace the uterus and interfere with contraction. Lochia progresses from rubra (red) to serosa (pink/brown) to alba (white/yellow). Rubra consists mostly of blood, serosa contains serous fluid and some blood, and alba is primarily leukocytes. The perineum should be assessed for edema, hematoma, and approximation. Edema can indicate tissue trauma, hematoma can cause pain and pressure, and approximation refers to how well the edges of any episiotomy or laceration are healing together.",
