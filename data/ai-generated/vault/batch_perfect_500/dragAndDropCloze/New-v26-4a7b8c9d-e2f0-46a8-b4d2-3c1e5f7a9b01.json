The bradycardia observed on the ECG is a direct consequence of hyperkalemia's effect on cardiac conduction. Immediate interventions are needed to shift potassium intracellularly and remove it from the body. The patient's history of CKD combined with diuretic use (furosemide) and declining renal function (elevated BUN/Creatinine) are likely contributing factors to the hyperkalemia.",

    "sbar": "Situation: Robert Jones, a 72-year-old male admitted yesterday for dehydration, is now acutely confused and weak. Background: He has a history of hypertension and CKD stage 3 and is currently on furosemide. Assessment: His BP is 90/50, HR 42, RR 12, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. ECG shows bradycardia. Potassium is critically high at 7.8 mEq/L, while Sodium is elevated at 148 mEq/L. BUN/Creatinine are 60/3.2. Urine output is severely decreased at 20 mL/hr. Recommendation: I am highly concerned about severe hyperkalemia leading to potential cardiac arrest. I strongly recommend STAT potassium-lowering interventions such as calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and Kayexalate. Fluid resuscitation is also needed, and we must closely monitor his cardiac rhythm. We require urgent orders to address this life-threatening situation immediately.",
