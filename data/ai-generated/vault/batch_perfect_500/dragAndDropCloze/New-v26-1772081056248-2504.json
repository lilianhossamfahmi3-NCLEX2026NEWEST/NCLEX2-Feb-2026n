        "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to prevent irreversible organ damage and death. Obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics is crucial to identify the causative organism and guide targeted therapy. Rapid fluid resuscitation is essential to address hypovolemia and improve tissue perfusion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered promptly to combat the infection. Titrating oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 90% ensures adequate oxygenation. Continuous vital sign monitoring is essential to assess the patient's response to treatment and detect any deterioration. \n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and aggressive management of sepsis are critical for improving patient outcomes. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign provides guidelines for early goal-directed therapy.\nquestionTrap: Students may prioritize oxygen administration before obtaining cultures or administering antibiotics.
