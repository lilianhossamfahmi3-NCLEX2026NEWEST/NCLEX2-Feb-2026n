Proper management includes administering a short-acting beta-agonist like [ ] to promote bronchodilation. Due to the patient's current respiratory distress, it is also important to administer [ ] to reduce inflammation in the airways. Continuous [ ] monitoring is crucial to assess the patient's response to treatment and identify any signs of deterioration. Finally, provide [ ] humidification to loosen secretions and facilitate expectoration.",

Corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the airways, decreasing swelling and mucus production.
