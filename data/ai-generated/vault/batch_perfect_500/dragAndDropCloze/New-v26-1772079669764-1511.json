Proper management includes administering a short-acting beta-agonist like [ ] to promote bronchodilation.

Continuous [ ] monitoring is crucial to assess the patient's response to treatment and identify any signs of deterioration. Finally, provide [ ] humidification to loosen secretions and facilitate expectoration.",

        "correct": "Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist that causes bronchodilation, opening up the airways and improving airflow. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the airways, decreasing swelling, mucus production, and airway resistance. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring allows for assessment of oxygen saturation and response to treatment, detecting hypoxemia or worsening respiratory status. Humidified oxygen can help loosen secretions, making it easier for the patient to cough them up and clear the airways, thus improving ventilation. ",
