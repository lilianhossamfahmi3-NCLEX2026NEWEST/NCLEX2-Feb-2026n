    "correct": "Morphine is an analgesic that reduces pain and anxiety, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Nitroglycerin dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing preload and afterload. ECG changes, such as ST-segment elevation, are indicative of myocardial ischemia or injury. Elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial damage.",

    "incorrect": "Providing additional fluids may worsen heart failure if present. Beta-blockers are typically used with caution in the acute phase of ACS.  While important later, cardiac rehabilitation is not an immediate intervention.  Normal troponin levels would be atypical for ACS in the presence of significant chest pain and ECG changes (assuming sufficient time has passed for troponin elevation). ST-segment depression suggests ischemia, not elevation, which strongly suggests injury.",
