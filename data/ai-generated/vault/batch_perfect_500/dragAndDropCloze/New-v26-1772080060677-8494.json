    "rationale": {
        "correct": "1. Administer dexamethasone: Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, reduces airway inflammation and edema, addressing the underlying cause of croup. 2. Administer nebulized racemic epinephrine: Racemic epinephrine provides temporary relief of stridor through vasoconstriction, rapidly improving airway patency. 3. Monitor respiratory status and pulse oximetry continuously: Continuous monitoring is essential to assess the patient's response to treatment and detect any deterioration. 4. Administer antipyretics for fever if needed: Antipyretics help manage fever, improving comfort, but are less critical than addressing airway compromise.",
