    "correct": "The patient's presentation of sudden onset right-sided weakness, slurred speech, and risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) strongly suggest an acute ischemic stroke. The neurological deficits correlate with left hemisphere involvement affecting motor and speech areas. While other conditions are possible, the acute onset and specific deficits are most consistent with a stroke.",

Ruling out other conditions is important, but the immediate management focuses on stroke protocol.",
