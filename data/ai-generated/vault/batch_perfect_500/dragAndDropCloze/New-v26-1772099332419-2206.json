        "correct": "Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, causing bronchodilation by relaxing smooth muscles in the airways, thus alleviating wheezing and shortness of breath. Oxygen therapy is crucial to counteract hypoxemia by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, facilitating oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Assessing breath sounds post-intervention helps evaluate the effectiveness of bronchodilation and oxygen delivery, identifying improvements or the need for further intervention. Continuous monitoring prevents respiratory failure. ClinicalPearl: Early intervention in asthma exacerbations can prevent respiratory failure. QuestionTrap: Selecting antibiotics is incorrect as they are ineffective against asthma, a condition of airway inflammation and constriction, not bacterial infection. Mnemonic: \"Open Airways with Albuterol and Oxygen.\"",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect options would not directly address the immediate needs of a child experiencing an asthma exacerbation. For example, antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of a bacterial infection. Restricting fluids could worsen dehydration, and monitoring blood pressure is less critical than assessing respiratory status in this situation.",
