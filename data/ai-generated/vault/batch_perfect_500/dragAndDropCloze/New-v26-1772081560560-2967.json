    "correct": "The correct order reflects the sepsis six bundle and immediate needs of the patient: 1. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics (timely antibiotic administration is crucial for survival in sepsis). 2. Initiate fluid resuscitation (hypotension indicates hypovolemia, requiring immediate fluid bolus). 3. Obtain blood cultures (before antibiotics, to identify the causative organism). 4. Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 >90% (addressing hypoxemia). 5. Monitor urine output (assess kidney function and response to fluid resuscitation). 6. Check Lactate Levels (to track response to treatment and evaluate tissue perfusion).",
