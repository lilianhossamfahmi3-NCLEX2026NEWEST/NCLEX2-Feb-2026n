        "correct": "The correct order reflects the sepsis six bundle and immediate needs of the patient. 1. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics: Timely administration is crucial for survival. Sepsis can rapidly progress, and antibiotics target the source of infection, improving outcomes. 2. Initiate fluid resuscitation: Hypotension indicates hypovolemia. Rapid fluid boluses support blood pressure and organ perfusion. 3. Obtain blood cultures: Ideally, collect before antibiotics to identify the causative organism, guiding antibiotic selection. 4. Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 >90%: Hypoxemia impairs tissue oxygenation. Supplemental oxygen ensures adequate oxygen delivery. 5. Monitor urine output: Assess kidney function and response to fluid resuscitation. Decreased output may indicate inadequate perfusion or kidney injury. 6. Check Lactate Levels: Elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to poor tissue perfusion. Monitoring trends helps evaluate treatment effectiveness.\n\n",
