Decreased skin turgor can be a sign of dehydration, which is common in both Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetes Insipidus due to fluid loss from frequent urination. However, normal TSH and T4 rule out Hyperthyroidism.  Diabetes Insipidus would present with low urine specific gravity, which is not available in the provided data but the high glucose points more towards DM.",
