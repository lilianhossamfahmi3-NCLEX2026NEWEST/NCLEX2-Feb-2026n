The body's response leads to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction, leading to tissue damage and potentially septic shock. Early interventions such as antibiotics to target the source of infection and fluid resuscitation to support blood pressure and organ perfusion are critical in managing sepsis and preventing further complications. Rapid identification and treatment are essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates.\n\n",
