        "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate priorities in managing ARDS. LTVV minimizes ventilator-induced lung injury. Neuromuscular blockade can improve ventilator synchrony and oxygenation. Hemodynamic monitoring and vasopressors address potential hypotension. Prone positioning improves oxygenation. Sedation/analgesia ensures comfort and reduces oxygen consumption. This sequence addresses the immediate respiratory compromise and supports hemodynamic stability while preparing for advanced interventions.",

        "sbar": "S: Jameson Cole, a 62-year-old male, was admitted three days ago with a diagnosis of pneumonia and is now exhibiting increased work of breathing. At 07:00, his SpO2 was 88% on 6L nasal cannula.\nB: His medical history includes COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He was admitted for pneumonia and initially treated with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.\nA: His respiratory status is deteriorating rapidly. The latest ABG results show: pH 7.28, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3 25 mEq/L. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates. His respiratory rate has increased to 32 breaths per minute, accompanied by the use of accessory muscles. At 07:15, the patient is increasingly agitated and restless.\nR: I am requesting orders for immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. I anticipate the need for ARDS management protocols. I need specific recommendations for ventilator settings, appropriate sedation levels, and positioning strategies. Please consider the use of neuromuscular blockade if necessary to improve ventilator synchrony. Continuous and vigilant monitoring of his hemodynamic status is crucial. Please address this situation promptly as the patient's condition is critical.",
