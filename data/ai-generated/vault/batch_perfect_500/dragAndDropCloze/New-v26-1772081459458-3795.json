        "correct": "The correct order of interventions prioritizes stabilization and addressing the most immediate threat (hemorrhage) before further investigation. Stimulating the fundus to contract is the first step, which helps to control bleeding by compressing the uterine blood vessels. Assessing for bladder distention is crucial because a full bladder can prevent the uterus from contracting effectively. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential to initiate further medical interventions if bleeding persists or worsens. Documenting the findings provides an accurate record of the situation, interventions performed, and the patient's response. \n\nclinicalPearl: Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Fundal massage stimulates uterine contraction, helping to control bleeding. A full bladder can displace the uterus and prevent it from contracting properly.\n\nquestionTrap: Prioritizing documentation before addressing the immediate threat of hemorrhage can delay critical interventions and compromise patient safety. Documentation is important but should follow immediate stabilization efforts.\n\nmnemonic: \"Fundal First\": Focus on fundal massage and assessment as the initial steps in managing postpartum hemorrhage.",
