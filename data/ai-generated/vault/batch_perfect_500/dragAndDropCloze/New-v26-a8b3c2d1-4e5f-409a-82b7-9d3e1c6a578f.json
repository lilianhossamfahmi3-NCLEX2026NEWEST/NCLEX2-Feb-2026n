The nurse should anticipate the need for positive pressure ventilation and monitor for complications such as pneumothorax. To optimize oxygenation, the nurse should consider placing the patient in the prone position.\n\nThe alveolar-capillary membrane damage is the hallmark of ARDS, causing fluid leakage into the alveoli and impairing gas exchange. Decreased lung compliance results from the edema and inflammation, making it harder for the lungs to expand. Positive pressure ventilation is often required to maintain adequate oxygenation and support breathing. Pneumothorax is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation, particularly when high pressures are used. Prone positioning helps improve oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, allowing for better gas exchange in previously compressed areas of the lungs.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of ARDS and appropriate nursing interventions. Review the underlying causes of ARDS, the effects on gas exchange and lung mechanics, and the rationale for specific interventions such as mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Pay close attention to the potential complications associated with these interventions. For example, consider why other options, such as treatments directly targeting the underlying infection, are not the immediate priority in the face of acute respiratory distress.",

      "trap": "Students may incorrectly select options that are related to respiratory distress but not directly caused by or related to the appropriate management of ARDS. For example, selecting options related to fluid overload as a primary cause of ARDS, rather than the inflammatory process damaging the alveolar-capillary membrane.",
      "howToOvercome": "Focus on the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS, which involves inflammation and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Identify the direct consequences of this process and the interventions that specifically address these consequences. Consider the immediate priorities in managing the patient's respiratory distress."

    "sbar": "S: This is a report for Robert Jameson, a 62-year-old male admitted two days ago with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU. B: Mr. Jameson has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He was initially managed with antibiotics and supplemental oxygen, showing some improvement. A: However, at 07:00 this morning, Mr. Jameson's respiratory status deteriorated rapidly. His current vital signs are: heart rate 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute and labored, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, and SpO2 88% on 100% FiO2 via a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood gas results from 07:00 show: pH 7.25, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3 24 mEq/L. A recent chest X-ray indicates bilateral infiltrates. He is increasingly agitated and confused, showing signs of acute distress. C: I am highly concerned about Mr. Jameson's impending respiratory failure and the possibility of ARDS. Given his rapid decline and current respiratory status, I strongly recommend immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. Further investigation into the underlying cause of his sepsis is also crucial. We need to closely monitor his response to treatment and be prepared for potential complications associated with ARDS and mechanical ventilation.",
