Albuterol helps with bronchodilation but doesn't directly improve oxygenation as quickly as supplemental oxygen.\nSuctioning the nares: Suctioning can improve airway patency, but it is not the most immediate intervention when the oxygen saturation is dangerously low. Oxygen delivery should precede suctioning.\nInitiating IV fluids: IV fluids may be necessary if the infant is dehydrated, but the immediate priority is to address the hypoxemia. Improving oxygenation will help stabilize the patient before addressing fluid balance.",
