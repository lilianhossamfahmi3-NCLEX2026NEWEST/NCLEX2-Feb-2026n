            "correct": "Brainstem lesions often present with cranial nerve deficits (diplopia) and cerebellar signs (ataxia) due to the proximity of cranial nerve nuclei and cerebellar pathways within the brainstem. The brainstem houses critical structures responsible for motor control, sensory relay, and vital functions. Damage to this area can rapidly manifest as cranial nerve palsies (affecting eye movements), incoordination, and even altered levels of consciousness.",

            "incorrect": "While cortical lesions can cause a variety of neurological deficits, diplopia and ataxia are more indicative of brainstem involvement due to the concentration of cranial nerve nuclei and cerebellar pathways. Cortical lesions are more likely to cause focal weakness, sensory loss, or language deficits.",

                "trapReason": "Students may choose 'Cerebellum' because of the ataxia, but the combination of diplopia and ataxia points more strongly to the brainstem. Ataxia can be caused by cerebellar or brainstem lesions, but diplopia strongly suggests brainstem involvement.",
                "alternativeDiagnosis": "Consider cerebellar stroke, but also keep brainstem etiologies high on differential. Cerebellar strokes typically present with isolated ataxia, without cranial nerve involvement."
