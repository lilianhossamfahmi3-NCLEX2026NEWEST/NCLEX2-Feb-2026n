    "correct": "Aspirin is a crucial initial intervention for suspected MI. It inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing thrombus formation and improving coronary artery patency.  Emergent cardiac catheterization is required to visualize and potentially intervene on the blocked coronary artery.",

      "description": "MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin) is a common mnemonic for initial MI management, but Aspirin should be the priority."

    "incorrect": "Nitroglycerin may provide pain relief by dilating coronary arteries, but it does not address the underlying thrombus formation.  Oxygen is important for hypoxia but less critical than antiplatelet therapy.  Morphine is used for pain management but doesn't directly address the cause of the MI.  Amiodarone is for arrhythmias; not indicated here.",
