    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Aspirin is a crucial initial intervention for suspected MI. It inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing thrombus formation and improving coronary artery patency. Emergent cardiac catheterization is required to visualize and potentially intervene on the blocked coronary artery. Early administration can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with MI.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Nitroglycerin may provide pain relief by dilating coronary arteries, but it does not address the underlying thrombus formation. Oxygen is important for hypoxia but less critical than antiplatelet therapy in the absence of documented hypoxemia. Morphine is used for pain management but doesn't directly address the cause of the MI. Amiodarone is for arrhythmias and is not indicated here. These interventions are secondary to aspirin administration.",
