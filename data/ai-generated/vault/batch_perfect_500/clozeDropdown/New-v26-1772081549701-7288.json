        "rationale": "Renal perfusion is essential for proper kidney function. Decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate that the kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow to filter waste products effectively. Adequate perfusion ensures the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the renal tissues, facilitating optimal glomerular filtration and tubular function. When perfusion is compromised, the kidneys' ability to filter waste products and regulate fluid balance is impaired, leading to elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "perfusionVsFiltration": "While filtration is a key kidney function, it's DIRECTLY dependent on adequate perfusion. Without sufficient blood flow to the kidneys, filtration cannot occur effectively, regardless of the nephron's intrinsic filtering capabilities. Impaired perfusion leads to decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the accumulation of waste products in the blood."
