        "correct": "Acidosis: A PaCO2 of 55 mmHg indicates respiratory acidosis due to the retention of carbon dioxide. The normal range for PaCO2 is 35-45 mmHg. In COPD patients, the target range may be slightly higher, but 55 mmHg still indicates significant CO2 retention. Interventions will focus on improving ventilation to expel excess CO2 and correct the pH. clinicalPearl: PaCO2 reflects the respiratory component of acid-base balance. Hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2) typically leads to respiratory acidosis. mnemonic: ROME (Respiratory Opposite Metabolic Equal) describes the relationship between pH and PaCO2 (respiratory) and pH and HCO3 (metabolic).",
        "incorrect": "Alkalosis: A PaCO2 of 55 mmHg indicates respiratory acidosis, not alkalosis. QuestionTrap: A PaCO2 of 55mmHg signifies elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood, indicative of acidosis, not alkalosis, which is characterized by lower than normal carbon dioxide levels.\nCompensation: While compensation is a factor in acid-base balance, the immediate concern based on the isolated PaCO2 value is addressing the primary disturbance, the acidosis itself. Interventions are needed to lower PaCO2 and improve ventilation before compensation can be fully evaluated.\nOxygenation: While oxygenation is important, the primary problem indicated by the PaCO2 is an acid-base imbalance. Addressing the acidosis may improve oxygenation, but correcting the PaCO2 is the priority.",
