    "correct": "The patient's decreasing cardiac index (CI), increasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), worsening hypotension, and declining urine output despite IABP therapy indicate worsening cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate and creatinine levels further support this assessment, suggesting tissue hypoperfusion and renal dysfunction secondary to inadequate cardiac output. The increasing BNP and troponin levels are indicative of heart failure and myocardial injury, respectively.",

Central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 28 mmHg. Cardiac Index (CI) is 1.8 L/min/m². Urine output over the last hour is 15 mL. Distal pulses are present but weak. Patient is confused and restless. IABP settings are currently 1:1.",
