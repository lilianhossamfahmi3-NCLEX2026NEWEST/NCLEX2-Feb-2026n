        "correct": "Initiating intravenous fluid resuscitation is the priority in managing sepsis to address hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. This aligns with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Rapid fluid boluses help to increase preload and cardiac output, thereby improving blood pressure and organ perfusion. The goal is to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg.",

        "incorrect": "Starting oral antibiotics is not appropriate in a patient with altered mental status and suspected sepsis. Intravenous antibiotics are required for adequate absorption and distribution to effectively combat the infection. Oral medications may also be poorly absorbed due to decreased gastrointestinal perfusion in sepsis.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reasoning": "Many students focus on the fever, but the hypotension is the more immediate threat and must be addressed first. While addressing the fever and identifying the source of infection are important, they are secondary to stabilizing the patient's blood pressure.",
