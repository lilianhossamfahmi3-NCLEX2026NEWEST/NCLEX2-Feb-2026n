    "rationale": {
        "correct": "At 20 weeks gestation, the fundal height typically reaches the level of the umbilicus. This is due to the growing uterus expanding upwards into the abdominal cavity as the fetus develops. Measuring fundal height is a standard part of prenatal care to assess fetal growth and development. Deviation from expected fundal height can indicate the need for further investigation.",
        "mnemonic": {
            "name": "Umbilicus at 20",
            "description": "Remember 'Umbilicus at 20' to recall that the fundal height is usually at the umbilicus around 20 weeks gestation."
        },
        "incorrect": "At 36 weeks, the fundus is typically at the xiphoid process. This is much higher than the umbilicus and indicates a later stage of pregnancy. The fundal height progresses predictably as the pregnancy advances, allowing healthcare providers to monitor fetal growth and identify potential issues such as intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Students may not have memorized the correlation between fundal height and gestational age at various landmarks, leading them to select an incorrect gestational age. This requires recall of specific anatomical landmarks and their association with gestational age.",
            "commonMistake": "Confusing fundal height with different gestational ages, especially at different anatomical landmarks. For example, confusing the umbilicus with the symphysis pubis or xiphoid process."

            "Fundal height measurement is a quick and easy way to assess fetal growth during prenatal visits. It provides a general estimate of gestational age and fetal development.",
            "Fundal height should correlate with gestational age within +/- 2 cm. Significant deviations warrant further investigation to rule out potential complications.",
            "Factors such as multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, or fetal growth restriction can affect fundal height measurements. These conditions can alter the expected correlation between fundal height and gestational age."
