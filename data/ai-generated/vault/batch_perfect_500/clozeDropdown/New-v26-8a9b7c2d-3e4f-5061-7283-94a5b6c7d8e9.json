The initial compensatory mechanism observed is [{2: increased, decreased}] heart rate, attempting to maintain cardiac output. However, the body's attempt to compensate is failing, as evidenced by the [{3: increased, decreased}] blood pressure. Therefore, the priority nursing intervention is to administer [{4: crystalloid bolus, vasopressors, antihistamines, bronchodilators}].",

        "correct": "Hypovolemic shock is most likely due to the patient's post-operative status, low hemoglobin/hematocrit levels suggesting blood loss, decreased urine output, and increasing abdominal girth. The compensatory mechanisms are evident by the increased heart rate, which the body uses to maintain cardiac output when circulating volume is reduced. The falling blood pressure indicates decompensation. Administering a crystalloid bolus is the priority to increase circulating volume and improve tissue perfusion. Rapid fluid replacement is essential in hypovolemic shock.",

        "incorrect": "Cardiogenic shock would be suspected if the patient had a history of heart failure or recent MI. Septic shock would be suspected with signs of infection, such as fever and elevated WBC. Anaphylactic shock would be suspected with exposure to an allergen and signs of airway compromise and hives. Vasopressors are typically used after fluid resuscitation has been initiated and is inadequate. Antihistamines are used for allergic reactions, and bronchodilators are used for airway constriction. While these may be indicated later, the priority is to address the hypovolemia.",

Urine output has been minimal since surgery; less than 30mL in the last 4 hours. Surgical dressing is dry and intact, but abdominal girth has increased. Labs show Hgb 8.2, Hct 25, and Lactate 3.5. A: I suspect hypovolemic shock secondary to possible internal bleeding or fluid shifts. The increased abdominal girth and low H&H support this. B: Orders include NS at 100mL/hr, pain meds PRN, and routine post-op care. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril prior to admission. Last dose of lisinopril was held pre-op.
