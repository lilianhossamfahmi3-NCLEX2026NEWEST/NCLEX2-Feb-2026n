B: Mr. Smith has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis, and a recent diagnosis of pancreatitis. He has not been responding appropriately to questions. A: The patient is disoriented to time and place and exhibits asterixis. His current Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 11. Lab results show elevated ammonia (250 mcg/dL), increased PT/INR (2.1), and decreased sodium (130 mEq/L). Vitals: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.5°C. Neuro checks are showing decline. O: I am concerned about the patient's increasing confusion and possible development of hepatic encephalopathy with increased intracranial pressure. I recommend frequent neurological monitoring, administering lactulose as ordered, considering hypertonic saline to reduce cerebral edema, and potential transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for closer observation and management of his neurological status. Please also assess gag reflex prior to medication administration.",
