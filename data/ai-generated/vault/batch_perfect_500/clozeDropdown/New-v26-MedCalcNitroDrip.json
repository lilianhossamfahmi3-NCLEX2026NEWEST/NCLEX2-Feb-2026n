  "stem": "The physician orders a nitroglycerin drip at 10 mcg/min for Mr. Johnson, who is experiencing a hypertensive crisis. The pharmacy provides a solution of nitroglycerin 50 mg in 250 mL of D5W. Based on this order, the nurse should program the IV pump to deliver [dropdown1] mL/hr to initiate the infusion. After 30 minutes of the initial infusion, Mr. Johnson's blood pressure remains elevated at 160/95 mmHg. The physician then orders to increase the nitroglycerin drip by 5 mcg/min every 3-5 minutes until the systolic blood pressure reaches 120 mmHg, not to exceed a maximum dose of 200 mcg/min. Following this new order, the nurse should increase the infusion rate by [dropdown2] mL/hr. This adjustment will result in a NEW infusion rate of [dropdown3] mL/hr.",

    "correct": "The initial infusion rate is calculated as follows: (10 mcg/min * 60 min/hr) / (50000 mcg/250 mL) = 3 mL/hr. This calculation converts the desired dose (10 mcg/min) into the equivalent volume to administer per hour, given the concentration of the nitroglycerin solution. To increase the nitroglycerin drip by 5 mcg/min, the calculation is: (5 mcg/min * 60 min/hr) / (50000 mcg/250 mL) = 1.5 mL/hr. This determines the additional volume needed per hour to achieve the increased dose. The new infusion rate is the sum of the initial rate and the increase: 3 mL/hr + 1.5 mL/hr = 4.5 mL/hr. This is the final rate the nurse will set on the IV pump to deliver the adjusted dose of nitroglycerin.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "title": "Desired Over Have",
      "expansion": "The 'Desired Over Have' formula is a helpful mnemonic for calculating medication dosages: Desired dose (mcg/min) / Have (concentration: mcg/mL) = Amount to administer (mL/min). Remember to convert mL/min to mL/hr by multiplying by 60 to match the IV pump's units."
    },
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers may arise from errors in unit conversion, such as incorrectly converting between mcg and mg, or neglecting to convert minutes to hours. They can also result from misapplication of the formula, such as inverting the concentration or failing to account for it altogether. Another error would be increasing the drip by an incorrect amount or using the maximum dose instead of the ordered increment. These mistakes highlight the need for careful attention to detail and accurate calculations when administering high-alert medications.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "A common mistake is to directly add the mcg/min increase to the initial rate without converting to mL/hr, or to miscalculate the initial infusion rate by overlooking the concentration of the solution. Another trap is to mistakenly increase the infusion rate by the maximum allowed dose (200 mcg/min) instead of the ordered 5 mcg/min increment.",
      "howToOvercome": "Carefully review the medication order, paying close attention to the available solution's concentration. Use dimensional analysis to ensure accurate unit conversions and apply the formula correctly. Always adhere to the specific titration parameters ordered by the physician and avoid assumptions about dosage increases."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Always double-check medication calculations with another nurse, especially for high-alert medications like nitroglycerin, to ensure accuracy and patient safety.",
      "Use a standardized formula and consistently apply dimensional analysis to minimize errors during medication calculations.",
      "Titrate nitroglycerin according to the patient's blood pressure response and established protocols, while continuously monitoring vital signs and assessing for adverse effects.",
      "Educate patients about the purpose of nitroglycerin and potential side effects such as headache or dizziness, promoting adherence and early reporting of concerns."

A: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is currently complaining of a headache and blurred vision, indicating potential end-organ damage. B: He has been started on oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula and is on continuous cardiac monitoring. His current blood pressure is 170/100 at 09:00. The physician has ordered an IV nitroglycerin drip at 10 mcg/min to manage his hypertension. Labs were drawn upon admission, and we are currently awaiting the results. R: There is a new order for a nitroglycerin drip. We need to titrate the drip per protocol to maintain his systolic blood pressure around 120 mmHg. The patient also reports chest pain rated 2/10. I will notify the physician immediately if the chest pain increases in severity or if his blood pressure does not respond to the nitroglycerin titration. His last dose of Lisinopril was administered at 08:00.",
