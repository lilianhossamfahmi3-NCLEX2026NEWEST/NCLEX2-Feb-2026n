    "correct": "Oxygen is a priority intervention for a patient experiencing a myocardial infarction. Increasing oxygen supply can help reduce myocardial ischemia and improve oxygen saturation. Rapid notification of the provider is also crucial to initiate timely interventions such as thrombolytics or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",
    "mnemonic": {
      "name": "MONA",
      "note": "While MONA is a helpful guide, remember that the order of interventions can vary based on the patient's presentation and specific needs. Oxygen and provider notification are the most critical initial steps.",
      "description": "MONA is a common mnemonic for initial MI management: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin. However, Oxygen and timely intervention take highest priority."
    },
    "incorrect": "While aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine may be indicated in the treatment of MI, they are not the *initial* priority before oxygen and provider notification, especially given the patient's potentially compromised oxygen saturation and need for rapid intervention. Aspirin is important, but ensuring adequate oxygenation and alerting the provider to implement reperfusion therapies takes precedence. Nitroglycerin is useful for vasodilation but can cause hypotension, which could be detrimental given the patient's already low blood pressure. Morphine is for pain management, but oxygenation is more vital.",
