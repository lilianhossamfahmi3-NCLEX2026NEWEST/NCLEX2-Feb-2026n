Aspirin is important, but ensuring adequate oxygenation and alerting the provider to implement reperfusion therapies takes precedence. Nitroglycerin is useful for vasodilation but can cause hypotension, which could be detrimental given the patient's already low blood pressure. Morphine is for pain management, but oxygenation is more vital.",
