        "correct": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, often indicated by rising creatinine and decreased urine output, which aligns with the patient's presentation. The kidneys' inability to filter waste products leads to the accumulation of toxins in the blood, causing further complications if not addressed promptly. Early intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible damage and improve patient outcomes. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolyte levels is also essential in managing AKI. Addressing the underlying cause, such as sepsis, is paramount in the treatment strategy.",

        "incorrect": "Heart failure would manifest with symptoms like edema and dyspnea, not primarily with elevated creatinine and decreased urine output. While heart failure can lead to kidney dysfunction due to reduced perfusion, the primary indicators in this scenario point towards a direct kidney issue. The absence of significant respiratory distress or peripheral edema makes heart failure less likely. Diuretics, commonly used in heart failure, would typically increase urine output, contrasting with the patient's decreased output.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Both heart failure and AKI can cause fluid retention, but AKI is specifically indicated by abnormal kidney function labs. The key differentiator lies in the lab values, particularly the rising creatinine levels, which are a hallmark of AKI. Focusing solely on fluid retention without considering the kidney-specific markers can lead to misdiagnosis. The patient's history of sepsis further supports the likelihood of AKI.",
