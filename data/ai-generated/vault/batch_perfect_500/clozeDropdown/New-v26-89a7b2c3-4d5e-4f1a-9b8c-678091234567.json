  "stem": "Based on the provided patient data, the nurse should anticipate the patient experiencing [dropdown1] due to the impaired liver's inability to metabolize bilirubin. This can manifest as [dropdown2]. Additionally, the elevated ammonia level indicates hepatic encephalopathy, requiring the nurse to monitor for [dropdown3]. The low albumin level contributes to ascites and edema; therefore, the nurse should assess for [dropdown4]. Finally, the prolonged PT/INR suggests an increased risk of [dropdown5], necessitating careful monitoring and precautions.",

    "correct": "Elevated bilirubin leads to jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and sclera. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by altered mental status, ranging from mild confusion to coma. Low albumin causes fluid shifts, resulting in edema, especially in the extremities. Prolonged PT/INR indicates impaired clotting factor synthesis, increasing bleeding risk. Hyponatremia is commonly seen in liver failure due to fluid retention and dilution.",

Options related to hyperkalemia, improved coagulation, or decreased ascites are directly contradictory to the laboratory findings and clinical presentation.

B: Patient has a longstanding history of heavy alcohol use. Liver function tests have been abnormal for years, but he has not consistently followed up with healthcare providers. A: At 07:00, the patient's abdomen is tense and distended. He is oriented to person only and exhibits asterixis. Vitals: BP 100/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 37.9°C. Labs show elevated bilirubin, ammonia, and prolonged PT/INR, with low albumin. U: I'm concerned about worsening liver failure and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. I recommend paracentesis to relieve ascites, lactulose to lower ammonia levels, and monitoring for bleeding.",
