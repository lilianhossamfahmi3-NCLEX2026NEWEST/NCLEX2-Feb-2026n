At 13:00, noted to have increased work of breathing and mild cyanosis. He's had a weight gain of 0.5 kg since yesterday. ASSESSMENT: Current vital signs at 15:00: HR 130, RR 36, SpO2 88% on room air, BP 90/60. Auscultation reveals mild crackles bilaterally. Lab results show normal electrolytes. He is scheduled for a dental cleaning tomorrow at 10:00. Physician notified. RECOMMENDATION: Please evaluate for potential hypercyanotic spell, fluid overload, and need for infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Consider ordering chest x-ray and adjusting medications as needed. Continue monitoring vital signs and respiratory status closely. I will call back at 17:00 for an update.",
