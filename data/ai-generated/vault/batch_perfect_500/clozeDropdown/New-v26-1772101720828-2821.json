A boggy uterus indicates uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Prompt intervention can prevent further blood loss and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.",

Assessing vital signs is crucial for monitoring the patient's condition, but massaging the fundus should be initiated first to control the bleeding. Documenting findings is essential, but immediate intervention is needed before documentation to stabilize the patient.",
