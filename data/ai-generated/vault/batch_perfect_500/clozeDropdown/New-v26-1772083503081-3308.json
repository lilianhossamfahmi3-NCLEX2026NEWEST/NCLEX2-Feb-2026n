He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.\nB: He presented to the ED with increasing dyspnea and confusion over the past 24 hours. He reports chills but denies chest pain.\nA: Patient is currently febrile (102.5°F), hypotensive (88/52 mmHg), and tachycardic (120 bpm). Oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. Labs are pending, but initial assessment suggests possible infection.\nR: I recommend immediate initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and further evaluation for sepsis.",

Timely administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial to combat the infection and prevent further organ damage and mortality. The patient's vital signs (fever, hypotension, tachycardia), elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate, and altered mental status strongly suggest sepsis.",
