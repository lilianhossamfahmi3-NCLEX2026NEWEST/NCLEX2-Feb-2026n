  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Prioritizing airway management is crucial in a pediatric patient with respiratory distress. The infant's low oxygen saturation, increased respiratory rate, and signs of respiratory distress (wheezing, crackles, nasal flaring, retractions) indicate significant respiratory compromise. Ensuring a patent airway is the first step in improving oxygenation and preventing further deterioration.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Administering bronchodilators, while important in treating bronchiolitis, is secondary to ensuring a patent airway. Bronchodilators will be less effective if the airway is compromised. Waiting for the chest x-ray will delay immediate interventions needed to improve oxygenation and ventilation.  Increasing the oxygen flow rate might seem appropriate, but if the airway is obstructed or the infant is tiring, it will not be sufficient to improve oxygenation.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reason": "This option is a distractor because it focuses on the treatment of bronchiolitis symptoms rather than the immediate need for airway management. The question is designed to assess the nurse's ability to prioritize interventions in a critical situation.",
      "commonMistake": "Many students might choose to administer a bronchodilator first, as wheezing is present. However, airway patency always takes precedence."
