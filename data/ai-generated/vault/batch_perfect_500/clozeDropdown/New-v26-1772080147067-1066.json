  "rationale": {
    "correct": "At 20 weeks gestation, the fundal height typically corresponds to the gestational age in centimeters, measured from the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Therefore, a measurement of 20 cm is expected.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "phrase": "Weeks equal Height",
      "explanation": "Around 20 weeks gestation, the fundal height in centimeters is approximately equal to the number of weeks of gestation."
    },
    "incorrect": "Values significantly higher or lower than the gestational age in weeks would be concerning for polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, inaccurate dating, multiple gestation, or fetal growth restriction and warrant further investigation.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reasoning": "The question tests the direct correlation between gestational age in weeks and fundal height in centimeters around the 20-week mark.",
      "description": "Students may choose values close to 20 but slightly off (e.g. 18, 22), indicating a lack of precise understanding of the expected correlation at this gestational age."

      "Fundal height measurement is a simple, non-invasive method to assess fetal growth and gestational age.",
      "Variations in fundal height can be due to maternal body habitus, bladder distention, or fetal position.",
