  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is generally avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the risk of hyperkalemia. The client's labs already show slightly elevated potassium. With reduced renal function, the kidneys are less able to excrete potassium, further increasing this risk.",

      "renalFailure": "Remember **K**eep **S**odium **L**ow in **R**enal **F**ailure, and avoid potassium-sparing diuretics (Spironolactone) to prevent **K**alemia (hyperkalemia)."
    },
    "incorrect": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used in CKD to manage fluid overload, as it promotes sodium and water excretion. While it carries risks like hypokalemia, it can be appropriate with careful monitoring.  Bumetanide, also a loop diuretic, is similar to furosemide and can be used in CKD for fluid management. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic, and while less effective in advanced CKD than loop diuretics, it's less likely to cause hyperkalemia than potassium sparing diuretics.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reason": "Students may focus on the general principle of using diuretics for fluid overload and overlook the contraindications or precautions specific to CKD. They may not recognize that the client's elevated potassium level makes spironolactone a particularly dangerous choice.",
      "commonMistake": "Choosing a diuretic that is generally effective for fluid overload without considering the specific risks associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly hyperkalemia."
