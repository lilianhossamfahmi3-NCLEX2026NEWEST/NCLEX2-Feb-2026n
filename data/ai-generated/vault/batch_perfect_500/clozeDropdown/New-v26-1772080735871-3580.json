        "correct": "Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is generally avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the risk of hyperkalemia. The client's labs already show slightly elevated potassium. With reduced renal function, the kidneys are less able to excrete potassium, further increasing this risk. Spironolactone inhibits aldosterone, leading to increased sodium and water excretion but also potassium retention. In CKD, this can lead to dangerous hyperkalemia.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used in CKD to manage fluid overload, as it promotes sodium and water excretion. While it carries risks like hypokalemia, it can be appropriate with careful monitoring. Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to significant fluid loss. Bumetanide, also a loop diuretic, is similar to furosemide and can be used in CKD for fluid management. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic, and while less effective in advanced CKD than loop diuretics, it's less likely to cause hyperkalemia than potassium sparing diuretics. Thiazide diuretics act on the distal convoluted tubule to inhibit sodium reabsorption.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Students may focus on the general principle of using diuretics for fluid overload and overlook the contraindications or precautions specific to CKD. They may not recognize that the client's elevated potassium level makes spironolactone a particularly dangerous choice.",
