        "correct": "A widening pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) is a late sign of increased ICP and indicates impending herniation. This is due to the body's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in the face of rising ICP. The systolic blood pressure increases while the diastolic remains relatively stable or decreases slightly, leading to a larger difference between the two. This requires immediate intervention to prevent further neurological damage. ",
        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 90 bpm is within the normal range and not necessarily indicative of increased ICP. While a headache can be a symptom of increased ICP, it is a subjective finding and less concerning than objective neurological changes. A urine output of 50 mL/hr is within the normal range and does not directly indicate increased ICP.",
