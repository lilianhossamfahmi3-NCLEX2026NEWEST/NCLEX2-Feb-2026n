Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is indicated to reduce pulmonary congestion. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the diuretic. Signs of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and EKG changes, must be reported promptly as furosemide can deplete potassium levels.",

A pre-operative echo revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. The surgical repair itself was uncomplicated.\nA: The patient is currently restless and coughing frequently. Auscultation reveals crackles in bilateral lung bases. Chest tube output has been minimal, only 10 mL in the last hour. IV fluids are infusing at 75 mL/hr. The last dose of furosemide was administered at 0000.\nR: Please evaluate the patient for potential fluid overload and consider adjusting the diuretic regimen accordingly. Closely monitor his respiratory status, reporting any signs of deterioration immediately. Continue administering current medications as prescribed. Implement droplet precautions due to frequent coughing and respiratory distress.",
