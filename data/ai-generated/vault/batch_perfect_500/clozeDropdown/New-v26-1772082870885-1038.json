    "correct": "Monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is crucial after a lumbar puncture, especially in a child with suspected meningitis, as the procedure can sometimes exacerbate existing pressure or lead to further complications. Signs include changes in level of consciousness, headache, vomiting, and changes in vital signs. This warrants immediate notification of the provider.",
    "incorrect": "While assessing the puncture site for bleeding is important, it is not the MOST important initial intervention. Bleeding is typically a localized issue and less immediately life-threatening than increased ICP.  Administering pain medication is important for comfort but does not take priority over monitoring for potentially life-threatening complications. Encouraging fluid intake is important for hydration but is less critical than monitoring for complications of the lumbar puncture and underlying meningitis.  Meningitis often causes nuchal rigidity, which is a stiff neck. While monitoring this is important, it is not the MOST important nursing intervention post-LP.",
