    "stem": "A 6-month-old infant is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot. Based on the provided data, select the most appropriate nursing interventions. The priority intervention is to manage hypercyanotic spells, also known as tet spells. During a tet spell, the nurse should first place the infant in a [cloze-1] position to increase systemic vascular resistance. Next, administer [cloze-2] via face mask to address the hypoxia. If these measures are ineffective, the nurse should prepare to administer [cloze-3] IV, which is a vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance and reduces right-to-left shunting.",

        "correct": "Placing the infant in the knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which reduces the right-to-left shunting of blood and increases pulmonary blood flow. Administering oxygen addresses the hypoxia that results from the decreased pulmonary blood flow. Phenylephrine is a vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance, thereby decreasing the right-to-left shunting and improving oxygenation. Morphine can also be used to calm the infant and decrease respiratory rate which aids in breaking the hypercyanotic spell.",

        "incorrect": "Supine positioning does not help increase systemic vascular resistance. While preparing for intubation might be a later intervention, it is not the immediate priority. Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat metabolic acidosis, which may occur, but is not the initial intervention. Digoxin increases cardiac contractility and is not indicated during a tet spell. Furosemide is a diuretic and would not be appropriate during a tet spell. Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in ductal-dependent heart defects, not Tetralogy of Fallot.",

        "sbar": "Situation: Liam Miller, a 6-month-old male, is admitted to the Cardiology Unit due to a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. Background: Liam was diagnosed at 2 weeks of age and has been experiencing increasing cyanotic episodes, concerning his parents. Assessment: At 07:00, the infant is agitated, with a respiratory rate of 60, heart rate of 180, and SpO2 of 78% on room air, exhibiting noticeable cyanosis. His mother reports that he is experiencing a 'tet spell'. Lab results show Hgb 18 g/dL and Hct 54%. Vitals at 06:30 were: RR 40, HR 140, SpO2 92% on room air. The MAR indicates PRN morphine sulfate is available. Recommendation: Titrate oxygen administration, prepare for possible IV administration of a vasopressor such as phenylephrine, and immediately notify the cardiology physician on call. It is essential to keep the patient calm and continuously monitor vital signs every 15 minutes. Provide parental support and education regarding the recognition and management of tet spells. Encourage the use of the knee-chest positioning during future episodes at home.",
