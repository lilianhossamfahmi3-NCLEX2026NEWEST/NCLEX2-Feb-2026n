  "stem": "The physician orders a continuous infusion of heparin sodium at 18 units/kg/hour for a patient weighing 176 lbs. The heparin is available as 25,000 units in 500 mL of D5W. Calculate the infusion rate in mL/hour. First, convert the patient's weight from pounds to kilograms. The patient weighs [weight_kg] kg. Next, calculate the units per hour needed: [units_per_hour] units/hour. Finally, determine the infusion rate in mL/hour: [infusion_rate] mL/hour. Round each answer to the nearest tenth.",

The concentration of the heparin solution is 25,000 units / 500 mL = 50 units/mL. The infusion rate is 1440 units/hour / 50 units/mL = 28.8 mL/hour. Therefore, the answers are 80 kg, 1440 units/hour, and 28.8 mL/hour.",

Eleanor reports a history of atrial fibrillation, managed with medication, and hypertension, also well-controlled. At 07:30, her vital signs were: BP 160/92 mmHg, HR 110 bpm and irregular, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and temperature 37.2°C. She is currently on telemetry monitoring. At 08:00, orders were received for a heparin infusion to address the DVT. Eleanor reports a pain level of 6/10 in her left leg, which she describes as a throbbing ache. She is alert and oriented x3. Please initiate the heparin infusion as soon as possible, following the prescribed protocol, and closely monitor for any signs of bleeding, including changes in vital signs or mental status. Document baseline neurological and lower extremity assessments prior to initiation of the infusion. Ensure aPTT is drawn per protocol. Notify physician for any concerns.",
