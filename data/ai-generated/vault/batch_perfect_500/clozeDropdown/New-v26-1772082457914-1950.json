Recommendation: Recommend thyroid antibody testing and start levothyroxine. Monitor for symptom improvement and adjust dosage as needed. Educate patient on medication adherence and potential side effects. Follow-up in 6 weeks to reassess thyroid function.

Hyperthyroidism would present with low TSH and high free T4. The thyroid is overproducing hormones, suppressing TSH. Euthyroid sick syndrome can present with abnormal thyroid hormone levels but typically occurs in severely ill patients, and this patient's presentation is more consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Euthyroid sick syndrome is a non-thyroidal illness affecting thyroid hormone levels.",
