        "correct": "Hypotension and elevated lactate are indicative of septic shock and require immediate intervention to improve perfusion and prevent organ damage. The body's response to infection leads to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, resulting in hypotension. Elevated lactate levels indicate anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate tissue oxygenation. Rapid intervention, including fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, is crucial to stabilize the patient and prevent further deterioration. Addressing hypotension and elevated lactate is paramount to improving patient outcomes in septic shock. Clinical Pearl: Early recognition and aggressive management of septic shock are essential to reduce mortality.",
