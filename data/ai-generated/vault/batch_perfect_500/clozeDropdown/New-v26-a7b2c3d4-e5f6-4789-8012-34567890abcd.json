    "correct": "The patient's presentation (marked hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis with low bicarbonate and pH, ketonuria, and altered mental status) strongly suggests Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The primary nursing intervention is to initiate an insulin drip to gradually correct the hyperglycemia and associated acidosis, alongside aggressive fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring for hypokalemia is crucial, as insulin administration can exacerbate this condition by shifting potassium intracellularly. The expected outcome is a restoration of acid-base balance, reflected by an increase in bicarbonate and pH levels, and a gradual decrease in blood glucose.",

    "incorrect": "Delaying insulin administration in DKA can lead to a worsening of the acidosis and electrolyte imbalances, potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. While fluid resuscitation is important for addressing dehydration, it is not the sole or initial priority in DKA management. Solely focusing on potassium replacement without addressing the underlying hyperglycemia will not resolve the root cause of DKA and may lead to further complications. Monitoring solely for hyperglycemia neglects the critical need to assess for and manage potential electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which can be precipitated by insulin therapy.",

    "sbar": "S: Ava Johnson, a 68-year-old female with a history of pneumonia admitted three days ago, is now exhibiting altered mental status and an elevated respiratory rate. B: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. At 06:00, she was found unresponsive by the nursing staff. A: Current vital signs include: Respiratory Rate of 36 breaths per minute, labored; Heart Rate of 135 beats per minute; Blood Pressure of 90/60 mmHg; Temperature of 38.9°C (102°F); and SpO2 of 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Laboratory values reveal Glucose of 650 mg/dL, Potassium of 3.1 mEq/L, Sodium of 130 mEq/L, Bicarbonate of 10 mEq/L, BUN of 45 mg/dL, Creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, arterial pH of 7.25, and PaCO2 of 28 mmHg. Urine analysis is positive for ketones. The patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time prior to this event. R: STAT orders have been received to: Initiate an insulin drip at a rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hr, administer a 1L normal saline bolus over 1 hour, commence continuous cardiac monitoring, repeat Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) every 2 hours, and insert a Foley catheter to monitor urine output.",
