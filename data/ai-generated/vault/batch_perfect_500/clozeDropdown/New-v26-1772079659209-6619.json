        "correct": "Systolic. A reduced ejection fraction (EF) indicates impaired systolic function, meaning the heart muscle is not contracting effectively to pump blood out of the ventricles. This is characteristic of systolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).",

        "incorrect": "Diastolic. While diastolic dysfunction can contribute to heart failure, a reduced ejection fraction directly reflects a problem with systolic function (the heart's ability to contract). The patient's EF of 35% confirms systolic impairment. Diastolic heart failure, or HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), would present with a normal or near-normal EF.",
