        "correct": "At 28 weeks gestation, the fundal height in centimeters typically correlates with the gestational age in weeks (plus or minus 2 cm). Therefore, a fundal height of 28 cm is expected. This correlation is due to the consistent growth of the uterus as the fetus develops. Measuring fundal height is a simple, non-invasive way to monitor fetal growth during prenatal visits. Deviations from this expected range can indicate potential issues such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or macrosomia.",
        "incorrect": "Fundal height should correlate with gestational age, +/- 2cm. Values significantly above or below this range warrant further investigation for possible complications such as multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, IUGR or measurement errors. It's important to consider other factors that can influence fundal height, such as maternal body habitus, amniotic fluid volume, and fetal position. Relying solely on fundal height without considering these factors can lead to misinterpretation of fetal growth.",
