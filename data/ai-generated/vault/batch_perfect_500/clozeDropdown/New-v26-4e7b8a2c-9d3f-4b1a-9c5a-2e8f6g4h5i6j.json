    "sbar": "S: Robert Smith, a 68-year-old male, was admitted two days ago for pneumonia. His oxygen saturation is progressively decreasing despite receiving 4 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. B: Mr. Smith has a history of COPD and hypertension. He was admitted two days ago with increasing shortness of breath. A: The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation at 10:00 AM due to acute respiratory failure. Current ventilator settings are: FiO2 50%, Tidal Volume 450mL, Respiratory Rate 16 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. An arterial blood gas (ABG) drawn at 12:00 PM revealed: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, and HCO3 24 mEq/L. At 1:00 PM, the nurse noted increasing agitation and a rise in peak airway pressure. Current vital signs at 1:15 PM are: Heart Rate 110 beats per minute, Blood Pressure 150/90 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 22 breaths per minute (ventilator-controlled), SpO2 88%, and Temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. The endotracheal tube (ETT) is secured at 22 cm at the lip. R: Please assess the patient and provide recommendations for ventilator management. Consider suctioning the airway and potentially adjusting the ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's agitation should also be addressed.",
