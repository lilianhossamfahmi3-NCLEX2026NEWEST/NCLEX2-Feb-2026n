        "correct": "Providing humidified supplemental oxygen is the priority intervention for an infant with bronchiolitis and low oxygen saturation.

While other routes of medication administration or types of oxygen delivery may be necessary later, they are not the priority when the patient is hypoxic and requires airway support.\n\nOral oxygen is not a route of administration.\n\nNebulized oxygen is a method of delivering medication, not a type of oxygen.\n\nIntramuscular oxygen is not a route of administration.",
