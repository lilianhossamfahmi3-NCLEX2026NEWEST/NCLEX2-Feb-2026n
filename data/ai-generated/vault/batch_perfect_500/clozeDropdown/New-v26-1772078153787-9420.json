Based on these findings, the nurse should FIRST select the appropriate oxygen delivery device and [BLANK] the oxygen flow rate.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Titrate. Titrating the oxygen flow rate allows the nurse to adjust the oxygen delivery to achieve the desired oxygen saturation target, typically 92-96% for patients without COPD and 88-92% for patients with COPD, while closely monitoring the patient's response. Starting with a low flow and gradually increasing it based on the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia, especially in patients with COPD. This ensures optimal oxygenation while minimizing potential complications.",
        "mnemonic": {
            "oxygenTitration": "Think 'TOAST' - Titrate Oxygen And Stay Tuned (monitor). This helps remember the iterative process of adjusting oxygen based on patient response."
        },
        "incorrect": "Initiate. While 'initiate' is part of the process, the key action is to actively adjust the flow rate based on patient response, making 'titrate' the more precise and critical action. 'Initiate' only refers to the start of oxygen therapy, not the ongoing adjustment needed for optimal patient outcomes.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reasoning": "Students might focus on the need for oxygen, but the question emphasizes the ongoing management of oxygen therapy, highlighting the importance of titration. The question requires understanding the dynamic nature of oxygen therapy and the need for continuous adjustment.",
            "commonMistake": "Choosing 'initiate' because oxygen needs to be started. However, the priority is to continuously adjust the flow rate based on the patient's response and oxygen saturation levels. This reflects a misunderstanding of the continuous monitoring and adjustment required in oxygen therapy."

        "clinicalPearls": [
            "In patients with COPD, high concentrations of oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to hypoventilation and increased CO2 retention. Monitor for signs of CO2 retention, such as altered mental status or increased somnolence.",
            "Always monitor the patient's respiratory rate, effort, and oxygen saturation when titrating oxygen therapy. Use a pulse oximeter and observe for signs of respiratory distress.",
            "Pulse oximetry can be unreliable in patients with poor perfusion or certain medical conditions. An arterial blood gas (ABG) may be necessary for accurate assessment of oxygenation and ventilation status.",
            "Consider using a nasal cannula or Venturi mask for initial oxygen delivery, as these devices allow for more precise titration of oxygen flow."
