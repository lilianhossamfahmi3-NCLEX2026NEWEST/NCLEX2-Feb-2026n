    "correct": "Titrate. Titrating the oxygen flow rate allows the nurse to adjust the oxygen delivery to achieve the desired oxygen saturation target, typically 92-96% for patients without COPD and 88-92% for patients with COPD, while closely monitoring the patient's response. Starting with a low flow and gradually increasing it based on the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia, especially in patients with COPD.",

      "oxygenTitration": "Think 'TOAST' - Titrate Oxygen And Stay Tuned (monitor). This helps remember the iterative process of adjusting oxygen based on patient response."
    },
    "incorrect": "Initiate. While 'initiate' is part of the process, the key action is to actively adjust the flow rate based on patient response, making 'titrate' the more precise and critical action.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reasoning": "Students might focus on the need for oxygen, but the question emphasizes the ongoing management of oxygen therapy, highlighting the importance of titration.",
      "commonMistake": "Choosing 'initiate' because oxygen needs to be started. However, the priority is to continuously adjust the flow rate based on the patient's response and oxygen saturation levels."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In patients with COPD, high concentrations of oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to hypoventilation and increased CO2 retention.",

      "Pulse oximetry can be unreliable in patients with poor perfusion or certain medical conditions. An arterial blood gas (ABG) may be necessary for accurate assessment."
