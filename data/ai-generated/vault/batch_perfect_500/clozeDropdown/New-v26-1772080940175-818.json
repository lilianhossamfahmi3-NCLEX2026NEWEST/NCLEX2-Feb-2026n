This requires immediate intervention as it can lead to cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction. The increased metabolic demands can strain the heart. Monitor for chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations.",

These values suggest the current dose of levothyroxine is insufficient, but do not pose an acute risk.",
