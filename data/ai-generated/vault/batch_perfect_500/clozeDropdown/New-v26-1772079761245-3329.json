This finding, coupled with her reported dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema, suggests worsening heart failure. The most appropriate intervention at this time is to [clozeDropdown] her diuretic dosage and monitor her potassium levels closely.",

    "correct": "Increasing the diuretic dosage will help reduce fluid overload, which is contributing to the patient's symptoms and decreased ejection fraction. Monitoring potassium is crucial because diuretics can cause hypokalemia, which can lead to arrhythmias and other complications, especially in the setting of heart failure.",
