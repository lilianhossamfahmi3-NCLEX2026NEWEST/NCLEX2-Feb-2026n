    "correct": "Increasing the diuretic dosage will help reduce fluid overload, which is contributing to the patient's symptoms and decreased ejection fraction. Monitoring potassium is crucial because diuretics can cause hypokalemia, which can lead to arrhythmias and other complications, especially in the setting of heart failure.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the diuretic dosage would exacerbate the fluid overload and worsen the patient's symptoms. Maintaining the current dosage may not be sufficient to address the patient's worsening condition. Discontinuing the diuretic altogether would likely lead to rapid deterioration and potential hospitalization.",
