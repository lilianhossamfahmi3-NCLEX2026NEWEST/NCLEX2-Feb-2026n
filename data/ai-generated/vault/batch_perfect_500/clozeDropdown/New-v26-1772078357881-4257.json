        "explanation": "A urine output of 20 mL/hr is significantly below the normal range (typically >30 mL/hr) and indicates inadequate kidney perfusion and function. In a patient with pre-existing CKD, this acute drop is a major warning sign for AKI, which can lead to rapid deterioration of kidney function and potentially life-threatening complications if not addressed promptly. Stable CKD would not typically present with such a sudden and drastic decrease in urine output."
