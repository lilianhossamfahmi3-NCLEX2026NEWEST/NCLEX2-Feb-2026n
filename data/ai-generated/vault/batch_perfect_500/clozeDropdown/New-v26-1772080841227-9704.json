        "correct": "At 20 weeks gestation, the fundal height is typically palpable at the level of the umbilicus. This is because the uterus grows predictably during pregnancy, and the fundal height correlates well with gestational age between 16 and 36 weeks. Measuring fundal height is a non-invasive method to assess fetal growth and development during routine prenatal visits.",
