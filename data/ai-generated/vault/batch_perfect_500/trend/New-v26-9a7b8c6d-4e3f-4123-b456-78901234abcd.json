A boggy fundus indicates uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. 2. Administer Methylergonovine (Methergine) as ordered to further stimulate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding. 3. Administer Labetalol as ordered to address the elevated blood pressure. Preeclampsia can persist postpartum. 4. Insert a Foley catheter to empty the bladder. A distended bladder can interfere with uterine contraction. 5. Monitor vital signs every 5 minutes to assess the patient's response to interventions and detect any further deterioration.",
