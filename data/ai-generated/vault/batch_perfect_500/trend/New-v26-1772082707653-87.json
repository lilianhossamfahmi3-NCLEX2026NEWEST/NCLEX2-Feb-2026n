    "correct": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance, hair thinning), vital signs (bradycardia), and lab results (elevated TSH, low Free T4) are highly suggestive of hypothyroidism. Priority nursing actions include contacting the provider with the assessment findings and preparing the patient for further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment. Assessing for potential complications, such as myxedema coma, is also important.  Initiating education about hypothyroidism and potential treatment options would also be appropriate once the provider has been notified.",

    },
    "incorrect": "While managing constipation and monitoring vital signs are important, they are not the priority. The priority is to address the underlying possible endocrine disorder (hypothyroidism) based on the presented data. Delaying communication with the provider could lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Waiting for additional symptoms is inappropriate given the already compelling clinical picture. Administering a laxative alone addresses a symptom, not the root cause.",
