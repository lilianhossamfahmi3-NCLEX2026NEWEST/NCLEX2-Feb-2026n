        "correct": "The patient's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L represents hyperkalemia and requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. The pH of 7.25 also indicates acidosis, which can be exacerbated by hyperkalemia. Addressing the hyperkalemia is paramount. Hyperkalemia can lead to fatal arrhythmias if not promptly treated. Interventions include administering calcium gluconate to stabilize cardiac membranes, insulin and glucose to shift potassium intracellularly, and potentially dialysis to remove excess potassium.",

        "incorrect": "While decreased urine output is concerning, it is a consequence of AKI and will be addressed with ongoing management. It does not pose the same immediate threat as hyperkalemia. Elevated blood pressure needs to be managed but is less immediately life-threatening than hyperkalemia. While pulmonary congestion is concerning, the hyperkalemia is the priority. Decreased urine output reflects impaired kidney function, but immediate interventions focus on life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. Elevated blood pressure requires management but is secondary to the immediate risk of hyperkalemia. Pulmonary congestion indicates fluid overload, which is addressed after stabilizing the potassium level.",
