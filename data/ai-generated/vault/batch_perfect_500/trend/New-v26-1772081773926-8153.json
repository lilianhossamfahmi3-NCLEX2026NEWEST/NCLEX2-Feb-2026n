  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Checking TSH and free T4 levels is the most appropriate initial step to evaluate thyroid function and determine if the levothyroxine dosage needs adjustment. Assessing medication adherence is also crucial, as non-adherence is a common cause of persistent hypothyroidism symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "Ordering a T3 level alone is insufficient. Free T4 is a more reliable indicator of thyroid hormone availability. Recommending a higher dose of levothyroxine without checking labs is dangerous and could lead to hyperthyroidism. Switching to a different brand of levothyroxine is unlikely to resolve the issue if the underlying problem is dosage or adherence.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "TSH is the best initial test for evaluating thyroid function.",
      "Free T4 provides information on the amount of unbound, active thyroid hormone.",
      "Subclinical hypothyroidism can present with similar symptoms, emphasizing the need for accurate lab interpretation.",
      "Consider potential drug interactions that can affect levothyroxine absorption (e.g., calcium, iron).",
