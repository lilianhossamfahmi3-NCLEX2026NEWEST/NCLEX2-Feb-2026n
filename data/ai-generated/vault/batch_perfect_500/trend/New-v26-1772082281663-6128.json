    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute indicates potential magnesium toxicity and respiratory depression. Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant, and respiratory depression is a serious adverse effect. Immediate intervention is required to prevent respiratory arrest. The therapeutic range for magnesium sulfate is typically 4-7 mEq/L (approximately 4.8-8.4 mg/dL), although lab values can vary slightly. This patient's magnesium level may be within range, but signs of toxicity can appear even within range.",

            "description": "B - Blood pressure decrease, U - Urine output decreased, R - Respiratory depression, P - Patellar reflex absent"
        },
        "incorrect": "Blood pressure of 150/92 mmHg, while elevated, is expected with preeclampsia and is being managed with magnesium sulfate. The goal is to prevent seizures, not necessarily to achieve normotension immediately. However, significant increases should be reported. Drowsiness is a common side effect of magnesium sulfate therapy. It is important to monitor the patient's level of consciousness, but drowsiness alone does not necessarily require immediate intervention, especially in the context of magnesium administration. Deep tendon reflexes of +1 are decreased but not absent. Absent reflexes would be a more concerning sign of magnesium toxicity. While still warranting monitoring, a +1 reflex does not mandate immediate intervention as urgently as a RR of 10. Fetal heart rate of 140 bpm with moderate variability is reassuring and indicates adequate fetal oxygenation.",

            "reasoning": "Students may be overly concerned with the elevated blood pressure, which is expected in preeclampsia, and miss the more urgent finding of respiratory depression. It is crucial to understand the specific risks associated with magnesium sulfate and prioritize assessments accordingly.",
