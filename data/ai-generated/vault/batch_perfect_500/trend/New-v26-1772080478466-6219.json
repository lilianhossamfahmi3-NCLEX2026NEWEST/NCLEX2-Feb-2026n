Her blood glucose is 580 mg/dL, and her arterial blood gas shows metabolic acidosis. The nurse suspects Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Which of the following findings would be MOST concerning and require immediate intervention?",

    "correct": "Potassium of 5.8 mEq/L.  Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening complication of DKA. Although total body potassium is often depleted, serum potassium may be elevated due to insulin deficiency and acidosis, which causes potassium to shift out of cells.  Cardiac arrhythmias can result from hyperkalemia, requiring immediate intervention such as calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose administration, or Kayexalate.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "DKA": "DKA - Diabetic Ketoacidosis: D- Dehydration, K - Ketones (in urine and blood), A - Acidosis and Abdominal pain. Remember to check electrolytes, especially potassium!"
    },
    "incorrect": "Blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg.  Hypotension is concerning and requires intervention with fluids. However, hyperkalemia is a more immediate threat to the patient's life due to the risk of cardiac arrest.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "hint": "Think about which lab value directly impacts cardiac function.",
      "lookFor": "Focus on what poses the most immediate threat to the patient's life (cardiac arrest risk).  Hyperkalemia is always more dangerous than hyperglycemia.",
      "commonMistake": "Forgetting to consider electrolyte imbalances and prioritizing blood glucose as the MOST dangerous factor.  Also, not understanding potassium's role in cardiac function."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In DKA, even if the serum potassium level appears normal or high, total body potassium is usually depleted. Potassium replacement is typically necessary during treatment but must be carefully monitored to avoid hyperkalemia, especially in the initial stages of treatment when insulin is administered.",
      "Always assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) first.  Then consider 'DEFG': Disability (neurological status), Exposure (skin assessment), Full set of vital signs, Give comfort measures.",
      "Kussmaul respirations are deep, rapid breathing patterns characteristic of metabolic acidosis, especially DKA. They represent the body's attempt to compensate for the acid buildup by exhaling more carbon dioxide."
