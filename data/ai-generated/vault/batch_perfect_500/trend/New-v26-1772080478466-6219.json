        "correct": "Potassium of 5.8 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening complication of DKA. Although total body potassium is often depleted, serum potassium may be elevated due to insulin deficiency and acidosis, which causes potassium to shift out of cells. Cardiac arrhythmias can result from hyperkalemia, requiring immediate intervention such as calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose administration, or Kayexalate.",

            "In DKA, even if the serum potassium level appears normal or high, total body potassium is usually depleted. Potassium replacement is typically necessary during treatment but must be carefully monitored to avoid hyperkalemia, especially in the initial stages of treatment when insulin is administered.",
            "Always assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) first. Then consider 'DEFG': Disability (neurological status), Exposure (skin assessment), Full set of vital signs, Give comfort measures.",
            "Kussmaul respirations are deep, rapid breathing patterns characteristic of metabolic acidosis, especially DKA. They represent the body's attempt to compensate for the acid buildup by exhaling more carbon dioxide."
