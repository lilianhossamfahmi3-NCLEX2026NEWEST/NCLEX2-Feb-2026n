        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Elevating the head of the bed is the initial action to reduce blood pressure. Then, identifying and removing the cause of the irritation is crucial. Checking the Foley catheter for kinks or obstruction is a common cause. Administering antihypertensive medication is the next step if the blood pressure remains elevated after addressing the potential cause. Finally, documenting the interventions and patient response is essential for ongoing care and communication.",

        "incorrect": "Delaying head elevation can lead to further increases in blood pressure and potential complications. Administering antihypertensive medication before identifying and addressing the underlying cause can mask the problem and potentially lead to rebound hypertension. Documenting is important, but not the priority in an emergency situation. Assessing bowel function is important but lower priority than immediate life-threatening symptoms. Administering pain medication is not indicated as the patient denies pain, except for the headache, which will not be resolved by standard analgesics.",

At 0715, his BP was 180/100 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, and he presents with a flushed face, nasal congestion, and reports a severe headache. The patient is diaphoretic above the level of injury. At 0720, the patient reports feeling anxious. His last bowel movement was yesterday. He has a Foley catheter in place, with clear yellow urine output. At 0725, I elevated the head of the bed to 90 degrees. At 0730, I notified Dr. Lee and am awaiting orders. The patient denies pain other than the headache. At 0735, I am checking for possible causes of irritation, focusing on the Foley catheter. At 0740, I will continue to closely monitor vital signs and implement orders as they are received. I suspect autonomic dysreflexia given his spinal cord injury level and symptoms.",
