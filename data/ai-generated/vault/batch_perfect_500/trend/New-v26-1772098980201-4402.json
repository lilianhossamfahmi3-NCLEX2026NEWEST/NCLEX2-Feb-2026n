    "incorrect": "While the other findings are concerning, they are not as immediately life-threatening as the severely elevated PaCO2. Increased work of breathing and elevated respiratory rate are expected findings in COPD exacerbation, but the ABG indicates the patient is unable to compensate effectively. The SpO2 is low, but the ABG provides more detailed information about the patient's respiratory status. The FiO2 is low and should be increased, but the ABG is the priority.",
