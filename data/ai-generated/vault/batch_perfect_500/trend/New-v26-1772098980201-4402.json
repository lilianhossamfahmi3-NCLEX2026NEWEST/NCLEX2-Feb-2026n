        "correct": "The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. A PaCO2 of 60 mmHg is significantly elevated, indicating inadequate ventilation. This requires immediate intervention to improve gas exchange and prevent further respiratory compromise. The low pH (7.30) confirms the acidosis, and the low PaO2 (55 mmHg) indicates hypoxemia, both of which are critical and require immediate attention to prevent further deterioration.",

        "incorrect": "While the other findings are concerning, they are not as immediately life-threatening as the severely elevated PaCO2. Increased work of breathing and elevated respiratory rate are expected findings in COPD exacerbation, but the ABG indicates the patient is unable to compensate effectively. The SpO2 is low, but the ABG provides more detailed information about the patient's respiratory status. The FiO2 is low and should be increased, but the ABG is the priority.",
