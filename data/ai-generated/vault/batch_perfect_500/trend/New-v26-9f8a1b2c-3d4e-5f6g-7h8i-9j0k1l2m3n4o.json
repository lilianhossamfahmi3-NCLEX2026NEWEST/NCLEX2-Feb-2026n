He received tPA at 09:00. Blood pressure has been labile. \n\nBackground: PMH includes hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He is on telemetry. \n\nAssessment: At 14:00, patient's GCS is fluctuating between 10 and 12. Right-sided weakness is still present. Pupils are now sluggishly reactive to light. Current BP is 180/100 mmHg, HR 60 bpm, RR 12, SpO2 96% on 2L NC. Temperature is 37.2°C. Recent lab results are pending. I am concerned about increasing ICP. \n\nRecommendation: I recommend STAT repeat neurological assessment, including pupillary checks, and possible order for mannitol. Please also consider further BP management.",
