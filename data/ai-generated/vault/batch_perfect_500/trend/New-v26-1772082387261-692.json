        "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92% (Rationale: The patient's SpO2 is currently 89% on room air, indicating hypoxia. Supplemental oxygen is essential to improve oxygenation. Target SpO2 is crucial to prevent hypoxemia and associated complications.), Administer nebulized albuterol and ipratropium as prescribed (Rationale: Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) that causes bronchodilation, while ipratropium is an anticholinergic that further reduces bronchospasm and mucus production. This combination provides synergistic relief.), Elevate the head of the bed (Rationale: Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm and improving ventilation. This simple intervention can significantly ease the work of breathing.), Monitor respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and lung sounds frequently (Rationale: Continuous monitoring allows for timely assessment of the patient's response to interventions and early detection of any deterioration. Changes in these parameters guide further treatment decisions.).",

            "mnemonic1": "OAA- Oxygen, Albuterol/Anticholinergics, Assess (respiratory status)"
        },
        "incorrect": "Encourage deep breathing and coughing exercises (Rationale: During an acute asthma exacerbation, forced coughing and deep breathing can exacerbate bronchospasm and increase respiratory distress. These exercises are more appropriate during the recovery phase when the airways are less reactive. Question Trap: Students may think deep breathing always helps, but it's contraindicated during acute distress.), Restrict oral fluids (Rationale: Dehydration can thicken mucus secretions, making it harder to clear the airways and worsening respiratory distress. Unless there are specific contraindications (e.g., impending intubation), adequate hydration is essential. Question Trap: Students might assume NPO status due to respiratory distress, overlooking the importance of hydration.), Prepare for immediate intubation (Rationale: While intubation may be necessary in severe cases, it is not the first-line intervention for an acute asthma exacerbation. Initial management focuses on bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. Intubation is reserved for patients who do not respond to these measures or who exhibit signs of respiratory failure. Question Trap: Students may choose a more aggressive intervention prematurely.).",
        "questionTrap": {
            "trap1": "Preparing for intubation immediately is a distractor, leading students to pick a more aggressive intervention too quickly.",
            "trap2": "Restricting fluids plays on the idea that they are NPO due to respiratory distress, but hydration is important and should be maintained as tolerated."
