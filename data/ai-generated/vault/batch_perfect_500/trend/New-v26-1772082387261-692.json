He received nebulized albuterol in the ED with minimal improvement. Mother states he has a history of asthma, but it is usually well-controlled with a daily inhaled corticosteroid. He is currently on continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring.",

    "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92% (Rationale: The patient's SpO2 is currently 89% on room air, indicating hypoxia. Supplemental oxygen is essential to improve oxygenation.), Administer nebulized albuterol and ipratropium as prescribed (Rationale: These medications are bronchodilators that help to open the airways and improve airflow.), Elevate the head of the bed (Rationale: Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and reduces the work of breathing.), Monitor respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and lung sounds frequently (Rationale: Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration in the patient's condition.).",
    "incorrect": "Encourage deep breathing and coughing exercises (Rationale: While important in asthma management overall, forced coughing and deep breathing can be counterproductive during an acute exacerbation as it may cause further bronchospasm and fatigue. They should be done *after* bronchodilation is achieved.), Restrict oral fluids (Rationale: Dehydration can worsen mucus plugging and exacerbate asthma symptoms. Unless contraindicated, adequate hydration is important to help thin secretions.), Prepare for immediate intubation (Rationale: While severe cases may require intubation, the initial approach should focus on less invasive interventions like bronchodilators and oxygen. Intubation is not the first-line intervention at this stage.).",
