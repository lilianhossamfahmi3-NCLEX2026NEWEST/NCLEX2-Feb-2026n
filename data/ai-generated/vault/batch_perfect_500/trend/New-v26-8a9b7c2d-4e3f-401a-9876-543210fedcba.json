Initial NIHSS score of 18. TPA administered upon arrival. A: 07:00 assessment: GCS 10 (E2V3M5), pupils equal and reactive, left-sided weakness worsening, new onset right-sided headache, BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 12 and irregular with periods of apnea. 07:15: Noted episode of emesis. O2 saturation 92% on 2L NC. Currently on continuous cardiac monitoring. Warfarin held. PTT result pending. Neuro checks every 15 minutes. C: I am concerned about possible increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to hemorrhagic conversion or edema post TPA. Requesting immediate intervention and orders for further management. Need orders for BP management, potential mannitol administration, and STAT CT scan of the head. Patient is at high risk for aspiration.",
