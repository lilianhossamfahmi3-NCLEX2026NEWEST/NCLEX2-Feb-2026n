        "correct": "The priority action is to assess the fundus for firmness. A boggy or relaxed uterus is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage because the uterine muscles are not contracting effectively to compress the blood vessels at the placental site. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contractions, helping to control bleeding. If the fundus does not become firm with massage, further interventions are needed.",
        "incorrect": "Notifying the healthcare provider is important, but it is not the first action. Assessing the fundus is crucial to determine the cause of the heavy bleeding. Weighing the perineal pad can be done after the initial assessment to quantify blood loss, but it does not address the underlying cause. Administering oxytocin is a possible intervention, but only after assessing the fundus and attempting to stimulate uterine contraction through massage. Oxytocin helps the uterus contract and reduce bleeding.",
