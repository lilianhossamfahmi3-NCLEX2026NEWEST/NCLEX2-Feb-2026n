        "incorrect": "Heart rate of 120 is elevated, but not immediately life-threatening in the context of ADHF. It requires attention but not necessarily immediate intervention before addressing oxygenation. Elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and can worsen heart failure. Blood pressure of 170/100 is elevated, but addressing oxygenation and fluid overload is the priority. Chronically elevated BP can lead to ventricular remodeling. Sodium level of 132 is low, but not acutely dangerous and can be addressed after stabilization. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. Creatinine of 1.8 indicates some renal insufficiency, common in heart failure, but not the immediate priority. Elevated creatinine can affect medication dosing and indicates worsening renal function.",
