    "correct": "Hypotension unresponsive to initial fluid bolus is the most concerning finding as it indicates septic shock, a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to improve perfusion and prevent organ damage.  Sepsis-induced hypotension that is not responsive to fluid resuscitation defines septic shock.  This requires vasopressor support.",
