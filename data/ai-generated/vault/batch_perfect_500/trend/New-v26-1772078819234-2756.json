    "correct": "The combination of hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg), elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L), and altered mental status (confusion) are strong indicators of septic shock. These findings require immediate intervention to prevent further organ damage and potential mortality. The high fever and elevated WBC count contribute to the suspicion of sepsis but are less immediately life-threatening than the hypotension and elevated lactate.",
