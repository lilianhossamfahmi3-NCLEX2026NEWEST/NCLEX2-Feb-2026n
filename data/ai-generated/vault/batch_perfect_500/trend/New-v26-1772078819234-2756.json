  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The combination of hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg), elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L), and altered mental status (confusion) are strong indicators of septic shock. These findings require immediate intervention to prevent further organ damage and potential mortality. The high fever and elevated WBC count contribute to the suspicion of sepsis but are less immediately life-threatening than the hypotension and elevated lactate.",
    "incorrect": "While fever, elevated WBC, and respiratory distress are concerning, the presence of hypotension and elevated lactate in conjunction with altered mental status are the most indicative of septic shock and require immediate action. Addressing the underlying infection and respiratory distress are important, but stabilizing the patient's blood pressure and addressing perfusion issues are paramount.",
