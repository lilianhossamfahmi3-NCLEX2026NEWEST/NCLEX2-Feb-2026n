  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The patient's boggy fundus, deviated to the right, and large amount of bright red lochia with a saturated pad in 15 minutes indicate a high risk for postpartum hemorrhage. The low blood pressure and elevated heart rate, coupled with the patient's report of lightheadedness, support this assessment. Immediate intervention is needed to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.",

      "meaning": "B-Breasts, U-Uterus, B-Bowel, B-Bladder, L-Lochia, E-Episiotomy, H-Homan's Sign (though not as commonly used now), E-Emotional State. This mnemonic helps remember the key areas to assess during postpartum care, highlighting the importance of uterine assessment and lochia monitoring."
    },
    "incorrect": "While the patient's pain level, elevated WBC count, edematous perineum, and intact episiotomy are important to monitor, they do not pose the same immediate threat as the potential for postpartum hemorrhage. A palpable bladder contributes to the uterine atony but is a consequence of the primary problem.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "distractors": "Elevated white blood cell count is normal in the immediate postpartum period and does not require immediate intervention unless accompanied by other signs of infection. Perineal pain and edema are expected after vaginal delivery, and pain management strategies should be implemented, but they are not the highest priority at this time.",
      "cognitiveLoad": "High, requires integration of data from multiple tabs (vitals, physical exam, labs) to identify the most critical findings and differentiate between normal postpartum changes and signs of complications."

      "A boggy uterus is unable to contract effectively, leading to increased bleeding.",
