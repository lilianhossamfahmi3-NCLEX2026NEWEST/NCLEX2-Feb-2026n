        "correct": "The patient's boggy fundus, deviated to the right, and large amount of bright red lochia with a saturated pad in 15 minutes indicate a high risk for postpartum hemorrhage. The low blood pressure and elevated heart rate, coupled with the patient's report of lightheadedness, support this assessment.

Perineal pain and edema are expected after vaginal delivery, and pain management strategies should be implemented, but they are not the highest priority at this time.",
