        "correct": "The presence of fever, lethargy, petechial rash, and neck stiffness in a 5-year-old raises strong suspicion for meningitis or sepsis. Obtaining blood cultures and initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial for prompt treatment and improved outcomes. Preparing for and assisting with a lumbar puncture is essential for diagnosis. Monitoring vital signs, including oxygen saturation and blood pressure, is paramount to assess the patient's condition and response to treatment. Administering antipyretics helps manage fever, improving patient comfort. Initiating IV fluids addresses potential dehydration. Contacting the provider with assessment findings is important for further orders and guidance.",
