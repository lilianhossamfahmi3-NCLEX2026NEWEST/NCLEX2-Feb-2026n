Increased blood pressure suggests the heart is working harder and may be a sign of worsening heart failure or inadequate blood pressure control. Increased heart rate, especially in the context of shortness of breath and crackles, suggests the heart is compensating for decreased cardiac output. Increased respiratory rate and decreased SpO2 reflect respiratory distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure.",

However, this doesn't negate the development of heart failure. Metoprolol administration aims to decrease heart rate and blood pressure over time. While one dose may not immediately reverse the trend, it represents an intervention aimed at improvement. The reported chest pain decreasing to 2/10 from previous reports (though not explicitly stated in the SBAR, the admission diagnosis and initial reports would likely have indicated higher pain levels) is a positive indicator.",

He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. B: His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. He initially reported chest pain at 07:00, rated 2/10, which was relieved with rest. O: At 10:00, his BP was 148/92 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, and SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula. EKG shows sinus tachycardia without ST elevation. Troponin levels are trending downward. A: We are closely monitoring Mr. Tyrell for potential complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stent thrombosis. Current medications include metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, and lisinopril. At 11:00, the patient reported increased shortness of breath. Upon auscultation, new onset crackles were noted in bilateral lung bases. At 12:00, the MD was notified of these changes and a STAT dose of furosemide was administered.",
