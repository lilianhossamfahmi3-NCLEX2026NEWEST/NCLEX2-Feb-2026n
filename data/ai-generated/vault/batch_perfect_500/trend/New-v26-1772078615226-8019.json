        "correct": "Administer prescribed antibiotics. Rapid administration of antibiotics is crucial in sepsis management to combat the infection and improve patient outcomes. The patient's elevated WBC (18,000/mm3), lactate (3.5 mmol/L), and procalcitonin (2.0 ng/mL) levels, along with clinical presentation (altered mental status, fever, increased respiratory rate), strongly suggest sepsis. Delaying antibiotics can significantly increase mortality. Early antibiotic administration targets the source of infection, preventing further systemic damage and potential progression to septic shock. Clinical studies emphasize initiating antibiotics within one hour of sepsis recognition to improve survival rates.",

        "incorrect": "Monitor urine output. Monitoring urine output is important for assessing kidney function and fluid balance, but it is not the priority intervention in the initial management of sepsis. Addressing the infection is the priority. While urine output monitoring is essential for assessing renal perfusion and guiding fluid resuscitation, it does not directly address the immediate threat of systemic infection. Delaying antibiotic administration to focus solely on monitoring urine output can lead to worsening sepsis and increased risk of organ dysfunction.",

            "whyItIsWrong": "Symptomatic treatment is important, but it does not address the root cause of the sepsis. Antibiotics are essential to combat the infection and prevent further organ damage. Focusing solely on symptomatic treatment without addressing the underlying infection allows the sepsis to progress, potentially leading to irreversible organ damage and death. Antibiotics target the source of infection, preventing further systemic inflammation and tissue injury.",
