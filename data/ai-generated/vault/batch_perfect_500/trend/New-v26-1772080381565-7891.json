While morphine can alleviate pain, it's crucial to rule out other causes of chest pain first.\n\nChecking blood pressure every 15 minutes is important but not the priority.  Addressing oxygenation and obtaining diagnostic information takes precedence.\n\nInitiating an IV infusion of normal saline at 100 mL/hr is not the priority.
