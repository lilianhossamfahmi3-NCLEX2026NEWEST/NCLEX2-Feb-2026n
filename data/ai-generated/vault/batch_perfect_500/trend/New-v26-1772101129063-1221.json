    "rationale": {
        "correct": "A blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg indicates hypotension, a critical sign of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. This requires immediate intervention, such as fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, to maintain adequate organ perfusion and prevent irreversible damage. Hypotension in sepsis often leads to shock and multi-organ failure if not promptly addressed. The body's compensatory mechanisms are failing, and aggressive treatment is needed to support blood pressure and cardiac output. ClinicalPearl: Persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation is a hallmark of septic shock.",
        "incorrect": "A: A heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated (tachycardia), which is a common compensatory response in sepsis to maintain cardiac output. While it warrants monitoring, it is not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension. QuestionTrap: Many students focus on elevated heart rate as a primary indicator of distress, overlooking the more critical sign of decompensation indicated by hypotension.\nB: A respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min is elevated (tachypnea), often seen in sepsis as the body attempts to compensate for metabolic acidosis and increased oxygen demand. While it requires monitoring and potential oxygen supplementation, it is not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension. QuestionTrap: Students may recognize tachypnea as a sign of respiratory distress but fail to prioritize the circulatory compromise indicated by low blood pressure.\nD: A temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) indicates fever, which is an expected finding in sepsis due to the inflammatory response. While fever contributes to increased metabolic demand, hypotension poses a more immediate threat to organ perfusion and survival. QuestionTrap: Students may focus on fever as a key indicator of infection, overlooking the more critical sign of hemodynamic instability.",
