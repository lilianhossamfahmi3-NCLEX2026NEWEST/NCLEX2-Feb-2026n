The reported symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation) are consistent with hypothyroidism.

Symptoms suggest the need for a dosage adjustment. The patient's TSH and free T4 levels are not within normal limits, indicating a need for intervention. Waiting several weeks without adjusting the dosage could prolong the patient's symptoms and potentially lead to complications.\n\nclinicalPearl: Levothyroxine dosage adjustments should be based on TSH and free T4 levels, as well as the patient's clinical response.\n\nQuestionTrap: The question trap is to assume patient non-adherence without considering the lab values.
