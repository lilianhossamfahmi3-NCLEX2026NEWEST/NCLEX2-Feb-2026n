Recent lab results show a TSH level of 6.8 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and a free T4 level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL).",

    "incorrect": "While adherence is important, the lab values indicate the current dose is inadequate. Simply reinforcing adherence without adjusting the dose will not resolve the hypothyroidism. Symptoms suggest the need for a dosage adjustment. The patient's TSH and free T4 levels are not within normal limits, indicating a need for intervention. Waiting for several weeks without adjusting the dosage could prolong the patient's symptoms and potentially lead to complications.",
