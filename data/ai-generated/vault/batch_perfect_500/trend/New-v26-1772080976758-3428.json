Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The elevated potassium affects the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to dysrhythmias. Immediate intervention is required to shift potassium intracellularly and/or remove it from the body.",

        "incorrect": "While a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg is elevated, it is not the MOST immediate threat compared to hyperkalemia. Addressing the hyperkalemia takes priority to prevent cardiac arrest. A creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL indicates worsening kidney function, but it is a trend and not an acute emergency like hyperkalemia. While a urine output of 20 mL/hr is low and indicates oliguria, the hyperkalemia poses a greater and more immediate risk to the patient's life. The low urine output will be addressed after the potassium level is stabilized.",
