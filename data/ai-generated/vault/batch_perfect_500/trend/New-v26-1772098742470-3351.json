While it should be addressed with antipyretics and monitoring, it is not the most immediate concern. \nA heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated (tachycardia) but is a common finding in sepsis due to the body's response to infection. While it should be monitored, it is not the most immediate concern. \nA respiratory rate of 24 is elevated (tachypnea) but is a common finding in sepsis as the body attempts to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
