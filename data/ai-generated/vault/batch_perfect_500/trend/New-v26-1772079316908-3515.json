        "correct": "Administer humidified oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient's current oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, indicating hypoxemia. Providing supplemental oxygen is crucial to improve oxygenation and prevent further respiratory distress. Humidification prevents drying of airway mucosa and helps to loosen secretions, facilitating easier breathing. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.",

While suctioning can clear secretions, it does not address the underlying hypoxemia. \nEncourage oral fluids if tolerated is important for hydration, but respiratory support takes precedence. The patient is also refusing to feed, indicating a possible need for IV fluids. Addressing the respiratory distress is paramount before focusing on hydration. \nAdminister albuterol via nebulizer as prescribed can help to relieve bronchospasm, but improving oxygenation is the priority. Albuterol is also PRN and not the immediate need.",
