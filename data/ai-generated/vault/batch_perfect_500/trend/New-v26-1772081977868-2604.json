Providing supplemental oxygen will increase the oxygen saturation and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues. This intervention directly addresses the immediate threat to the patient's well-being.",

Waiting to contact the provider before administering oxygen delays crucial treatment and could lead to further deterioration of the patient's condition. The nurse should initiate oxygen therapy and then contact the provider to discuss further management.",
