At 11:00, her BP was 148/96, pulse 92, and respirations 20. She reported a 4/10 headache. At 11:30, the patient voided 100 mL. At 12:00, her BP is 152/98, pulse 96, respirations 22, and she reports a worsening headache, blurred vision, and dizziness. Fundus is boggy at 2 cm above the umbilicus, deviated to the right. Moderate lochia rubra with small clots is noted. Current IV is Lactated Ringers at 125 mL/hr. Her pre-pregnancy BP was 110/70. The patient's symptoms indicate a possible complication of postpartum hemorrhage and the onset or worsening of preeclampsia, requiring immediate nursing intervention and physician notification.",
