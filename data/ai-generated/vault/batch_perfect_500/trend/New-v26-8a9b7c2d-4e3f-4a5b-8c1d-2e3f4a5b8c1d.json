    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency characterized by a sudden onset of excessively high blood pressure. The triggering stimulus is usually related to a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury. Key interventions include elevating the head of the bed to reduce blood pressure, identifying and removing the triggering stimulus (e.g., bladder distention, bowel impaction), monitoring blood pressure closely, and administering antihypertensive medications as prescribed. Failing to address the underlying cause can lead to severe complications such as stroke or seizure. The nurse must act quickly and systematically to manage the patient's condition.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Ignoring the symptoms or focusing on non-critical interventions will delay treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. Administering pain medication alone will not address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Waiting for further orders without implementing immediate interventions is also inappropriate. Not addressing the bladder distention or bowel impaction will perpetuate the problem. Laying the patient flat can worsen the hypertension.",

B: He sustained the SCI three years ago in a motor vehicle accident. He has a history of autonomic dysreflexia. Last episode was six months ago. A: At 07:00, his BP was 110/70 mmHg, HR 72 bpm. At 07:30, his BP is 160/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm. He's flushed and complaining of blurred vision. Bladder scan reveals 600 mL urine. He reports constipation x 3 days. R: I recommend immediate interventions for autonomic dysreflexia, including checking for bladder distention and bowel impaction, elevating the head of the bed, and notifying the physician for possible medication orders. Will continue to monitor BP q5min.",
