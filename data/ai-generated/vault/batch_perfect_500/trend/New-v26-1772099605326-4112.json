        "correct": "The nurse should prioritize assessing the patient's adherence to the medication regimen and technique. While the patient reports taking the medication as prescribed, it's crucial to verify this information and rule out any issues with administration or absorption before considering other causes of treatment failure. This includes asking the patient to describe how they take the medication (e.g., with food, other medications) and if they have missed any doses. Ensuring proper medication administration is key to effective treatment. If adherence is confirmed, further investigation into other potential causes can be initiated.",

        "incorrect": "Increasing the levothyroxine dosage without further assessment could lead to hyperthyroidism. Ordering a TSH level is appropriate but does not address the immediate need to assess adherence. Recommending a consultation with a dietitian is helpful for weight management and constipation but does not address the potential medication-related issues. Assessing for drug interactions is important but should be done after adherence is confirmed.",
