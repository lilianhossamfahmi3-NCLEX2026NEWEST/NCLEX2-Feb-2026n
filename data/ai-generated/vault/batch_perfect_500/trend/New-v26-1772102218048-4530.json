Background: Mr. Smith has a history of diabetes insipidus diagnosed 5 years ago. He reports poor adherence to previous desmopressin (DDAVP) regimen. Assessment: Current assessment reveals urine output of 6L/24 hours, serum sodium of 150 mEq/L, and urine specific gravity of 1.001. He reports excessive thirst and nocturia. Vitals: BP 110/70, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F. Recommendation: Evaluate the effectiveness of the current desmopressin (DDAVP) dose and adjust as needed. Monitor urine output, serum sodium, and urine specific gravity.",

        "correct": "Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analog of vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone. Its effectiveness is indicated by a decrease in urine output, reflecting improved water reabsorption by the kidneys. This leads to a reduction in polyuria, a hallmark of diabetes insipidus. The goal is to restore normal fluid balance.",
        "incorrect": "Increased urine output indicates the medication is not effectively controlling fluid balance, worsening the polyuria associated with diabetes insipidus. Elevated serum sodium levels suggest dehydration or ineffective treatment, as desmopressin should help retain water and dilute the sodium concentration. While decreased thirst may occur as a secondary effect of improved hydration, the primary indicator of effectiveness is reduced urine output.",
