The child's parent reports that the child has been using their albuterol inhaler every 2 hours for the past 24 hours with minimal relief. Vital signs are: heart rate 140 bpm, respiratory rate 36 breaths/min with retractions, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. The nurse auscultates bilateral wheezing. Which of the following actions should the nurse prioritize?",
