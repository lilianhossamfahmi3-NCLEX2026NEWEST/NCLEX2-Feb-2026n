Therefore, the nurse should massage the fundus to stimulate contraction and assist the patient to empty her bladder.

Increased heart rate, respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and heavy bleeding indicate hypovolemic shock.

Applying oxygen is important for hypoxia but does not address the underlying cause of the bleeding and preeclampsia. Encouraging ambulation is contraindicated due to dizziness and bleeding. Documenting findings is always important, but immediate interventions are needed first.",
