Prompt intervention is crucial to improve outcomes. Administering IV fluids addresses the hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion. Administering prescribed antibiotics is essential for treating the infection causing the sepsis. Monitoring urine output is essential for assessing fluid status and renal perfusion.
