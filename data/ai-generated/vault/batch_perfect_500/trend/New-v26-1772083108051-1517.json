While the patient's glucose is elevated, rapid changes to medication can be dangerous.  Order a T3/T4 thyroid test due to fatigue.  While fatigue can be related to thyroid issues, the more likely cause based on the patient's history and lab results is poor glycemic control.  Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 months. The patient's elevated A1c and blood glucose levels warrant a more immediate follow-up to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Consult a nephrologist for elevated serum creatinine.  The serum creatinine is within normal limits. No nephrology consult is indicated at this time.",
