A1c of 8.2% and fasting glucose of 180 mg/dL indicate poor glycemic control. Reinforcing adherence to the current care plan is a critical first step. Discussing diet and exercise reinforces these lifestyle modifications, empowering the patient to actively participate in their care. This approach addresses the root cause of the elevated glucose levels and promotes long-term management.",

        "incorrect": "Immediately increasing the metformin dosage without further assessment could lead to hypoglycemia. While the patient's glucose is elevated, rapid changes to medication can be dangerous. A gradual, informed adjustment is safer. Ordering a T3/T4 thyroid test due to fatigue is less likely given the patient's history and lab results, which strongly suggest poor glycemic control as the primary cause of fatigue. Scheduling a follow-up appointment in 6 months is insufficient; the patient's elevated A1c and blood glucose levels warrant a more immediate follow-up to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Consulting a nephrologist for elevated serum creatinine is unnecessary, as the serum creatinine is within normal limits.",
