        "correct": "A STAT CT scan of the head is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This differentiation is essential because it determines the appropriate treatment pathway: thrombolytics for ischemic stroke versus supportive care and blood pressure management for hemorrhagic stroke. Rapid identification of the stroke type is paramount to minimize brain damage and improve patient outcomes.",

        "incorrect": "Administering aspirin is premature and potentially harmful without knowing if the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Aspirin is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke due to the increased risk of bleeding. Waiting for further symptom development delays crucial intervention and increases the potential for irreversible brain damage. Requesting a neurological consult is appropriate, but it should occur concurrently with or immediately following the CT scan, not as a preceding step. Obtaining a detailed history is important but can be done concurrently with initiating the stroke protocol and ordering the CT scan to avoid delaying time-sensitive interventions.",

            "reason": "The distractors focus on actions that are either premature or delay the most critical initial step: determining the type of stroke. The question emphasizes 'initial' and 'MOST appropriate' to guide the test-taker toward the immediate need for diagnostic imaging.",
