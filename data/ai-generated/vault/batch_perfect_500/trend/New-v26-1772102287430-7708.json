Ordering a TSH level is a subsequent step after confirming adherence. \n\nIncreasing the levothyroxine dosage without assessing adherence and absorption issues first could lead to hyperthyroidism if the patient is already absorbing the medication adequately. \n\nReferring the patient to a gastroenterologist is premature. Constipation is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, and addressing the thyroid hormone levels is the initial step.",
