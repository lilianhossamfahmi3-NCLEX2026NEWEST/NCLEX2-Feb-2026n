        "correct": "Restrict fluid intake to match output plus insensible losses. (Rationale: AKI often leads to fluid overload due to decreased urine production. Restricting fluids prevents complications such as pulmonary edema.) Clinical Pearl: Monitor daily weights and assess for edema to guide fluid management.|Monitor potassium levels closely and administer potassium-lowering medications as prescribed. (Rationale: Hyperkalemia is a common and dangerous complication of AKI due to the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.) Clinical Pearl: Review the patient's medication list for drugs that can exacerbate hyperkalemia, such as ACE inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics.|Administer prescribed antihypertensive medications. (Rationale: Managing hypertension is crucial for protecting renal function and preventing further damage. Maintaining adequate blood pressure supports renal perfusion.)

        "incorrect": "Encourage high protein intake to promote healing. (Rationale: In AKI, protein breakdown can lead to increased nitrogenous waste products, worsening azotemia. Protein intake is usually restricted to minimize the workload on the kidneys.) Question Trap: Students may incorrectly associate protein intake with general wound healing without considering the impact on kidney function in AKI.|Administer a large bolus of intravenous fluids to improve kidney perfusion. (Rationale: In AKI, especially if the patient is oliguric or anuric, a large fluid bolus can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and further compromise kidney function.) Question Trap: Students may think increasing fluids will help kidney perfusion, but in AKI, it can worsen fluid overload.|Discontinue all antihypertensive medications. (Rationale: While some antihypertensives may need adjustment, abruptly stopping them can cause rebound hypertension and further kidney damage. Careful management is needed.)
