Restricting fluids prevents complications such as pulmonary edema.)|Monitor potassium levels closely and administer potassium-lowering medications as prescribed.

(Rationale: In AKI, especially if the patient is oliguric, a large fluid bolus can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.)|Discontinue all antihypertensive medications.
