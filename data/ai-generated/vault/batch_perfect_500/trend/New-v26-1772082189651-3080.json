While important to monitor, the primary concern is the low blood pressure. \nA respiratory rate of 22 is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range, especially in the context of post-dialysis fluid shifts and potential anxiety. \nA potassium level of 5.2 mEq/L is within the normal range and does not require immediate intervention.",
