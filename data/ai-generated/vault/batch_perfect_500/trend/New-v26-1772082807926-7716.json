The patient's SpO2 is 95% on room air, suggesting adequate oxygenation. Focus on diagnostic imaging and stroke protocol initiation is paramount. QuestionTrap: Prioritizing oxygenation alone without addressing the potential stroke.\n\nObtain a detailed medical history from the patient's wife: While a detailed history is valuable, it can be obtained concurrently with initial interventions. Delaying diagnostic imaging to gather a complete history could prolong the time to treatment. QuestionTrap: Delaying imaging to gather a complete history will delay treatment.\n\nCheck the patient's blood glucose level: Checking blood glucose is important, but it is not the most immediate action. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia can mimic stroke symptoms, but CT imaging should take precedence. Point of care testing should be performed concurrently, not before stroke activation.
