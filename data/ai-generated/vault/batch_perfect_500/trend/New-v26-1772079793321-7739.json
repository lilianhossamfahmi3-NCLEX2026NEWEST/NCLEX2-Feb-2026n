        "correct": "Rapid assessment and intervention are crucial in managing acute stroke. Obtaining a CT scan to rule out hemorrhage is the priority. Activating the stroke team ensures a coordinated response and timely treatment. Monitoring vital signs, particularly blood pressure, is essential to guide treatment decisions.

Waiting for lab results before obtaining a CT scan delays critical diagnostic information. Elevating the head of the bed is generally beneficial, but not the highest priority in the initial moments of stroke management. Starting oxygen via nasal cannula is appropriate if SpO2 is below 92% but is not the highest priority if the patient is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation on room air.",
