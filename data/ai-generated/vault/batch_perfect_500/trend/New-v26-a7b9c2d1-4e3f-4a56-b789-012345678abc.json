He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A: At 07:00, the patient reports abdominal pain as 7/10. Vital signs are: BP 100/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, and Temp 38.5°C. Lab results show elevated amylase, lipase, and total bilirubin. He's currently receiving continuous IV fluids, hydromorphone for pain, and ondansetron for nausea. Input and output are being monitored. At 08:00, assessment reveals abdominal distension and guarding. R: I recommend continuing pain management, closely monitoring for complications like hypovolemic shock and ARDS. We should consider escalating care if his condition worsens. A nutritional support consult and a social work referral for alcohol abuse counseling are also recommended.",
