B: Samuel was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for pre-operative assessment and stabilization. He has a history of cyanotic episodes, especially during feeding. O: At 07:00, his O2 saturation is 78% on room air. He's irritable and pulling at his IV site. Vital signs: HR 170, RR 52, Temp 37.8°C (100.0°F). He has a grade III/VI systolic murmur. A: Samuel is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (“Tet spell”) likely triggered by agitation. Pre-operative anxiety is exacerbating his condition. P: I recommend administering morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV now, positioning him in a knee-chest position, and increasing his IV fluids to 1.5 times maintenance. Please provide orders to address the hypercyanotic spell and pre-operative anxiety. Also, ensure the surgical team is aware of this episode prior to surgery.",
