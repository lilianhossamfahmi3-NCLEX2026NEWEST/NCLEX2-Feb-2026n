    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Hypotension (90/60 mmHg) in the context of acute chest pain is a highly concerning finding. It suggests cardiogenic shock or severe hypoperfusion, which can rapidly lead to end-organ damage and death. Immediate intervention to improve blood pressure is crucial. The reduced blood flow compromises oxygen delivery to vital organs, exacerbating myocardial ischemia and potentially leading to irreversible damage if not promptly addressed.",

        "incorrect": "While anxiety exacerbates the situation, addressing the underlying physiological problem is paramount. Treating the anxiety alone will not resolve the root cause. (Anxiety management is secondary to hemodynamic stabilization). Addressing the anxiety without stabilizing hemodynamics will not improve the patient's oxygenation or cardiac function.",
