    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. First, elevate the head of bed to at least 45 degrees to reduce blood pressure. Then, assess for and remove the triggering stimulus, beginning with the most common cause: bladder distension. Catheterize the patient to relieve any urinary retention. Monitor blood pressure closely during and after interventions. If BP remains elevated after addressing bladder issues, administer antihypertensive medication (nifedipine) as prescribed. Continuously reassess the patient's symptoms and BP.",

He's reporting a severe headache and feels flushed.\nB: Mr. Miller sustained the SCI in a motorcycle accident six months ago. He usually manages well but has had occasional UTIs. He's on scheduled baclofen and intermittent catheterization q6h.\nA: At 07:00, his BP was 110/70 mmHg and HR 72 bpm. Now, at 07:30, his BP is 210/110 mmHg and HR is 50 bpm. He's diaphoretic above the injury level and has goosebumps below. I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. Last BM was two days ago. \nR: I've elevated his head of bed. I'm requesting you evaluate him urgently for autonomic dysreflexia management. I’m prepared to administer nifedipine if ordered.",
