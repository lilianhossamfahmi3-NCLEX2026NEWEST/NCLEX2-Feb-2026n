        "correct": "Elevated heart rate (HR), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), increased respiratory rate (RR), decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2), and elevated creatinine are all indicators of worsening heart failure. Elevated HR indicates the heart is working harder to compensate for decreased cardiac output. Elevated BP can result from fluid overload and vasoconstriction. Elevated BNP confirms increased cardiac workload and ventricular stretch. Increased RR and decreased SpO2 suggest pulmonary congestion and impaired gas exchange. Elevated creatinine may indicate kidney damage due to decreased renal perfusion secondary to heart failure.",

        "incorrect": "Normal potassium levels do not indicate worsening heart failure. While low sodium can be a concern (often dilutional hyponatremia in HF), it is not as directly indicative of worsening heart failure as the other options in this scenario. Low sodium can be due to fluid overload and the body's attempt to dilute the excess fluid.",
