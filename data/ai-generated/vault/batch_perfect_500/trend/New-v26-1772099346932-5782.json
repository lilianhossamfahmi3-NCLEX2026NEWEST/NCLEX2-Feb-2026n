        "correct": "The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2). This requires immediate intervention to improve ventilation and oxygenation. The low pH (7.30) and elevated PaCO2 (60 mmHg) signify that the patient is not effectively eliminating carbon dioxide, leading to an acidotic state. Immediate interventions may include increasing oxygen delivery, assisting ventilation, or administering medications to improve airway patency. The other findings, while concerning, do not pose as immediate a threat to the patient's life. The SpO2 is within acceptable limits for a COPD patient, the respiratory rate is elevated but not critically so, and sputum production is expected in COPD exacerbations. \n\nclinicalPearl: In COPD patients, a baseline SpO2 of 88-92% is often acceptable due to chronic CO2 retention. However, acute changes in ABGs indicating respiratory acidosis require immediate attention.\nquestionTrap: The question traps the test taker into thinking that the elevated respiratory rate or sputum production are more critical, but the ABG results are the most concerning because they directly reflect impaired gas exchange and acid-base balance.\nmnemonic: ABCs - Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Prioritize interventions based on the most immediate threat to these vital functions.",

The ABG values (pH 7.30, PaCO2 60 mmHg) indicate that the patient is retaining carbon dioxide and developing respiratory acidosis, which can quickly lead to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly. The other findings, such as the SpO2, respiratory rate, and sputum production, are important to monitor but do not require as immediate an intervention as the acid-base imbalance reflected in the ABGs.",
