        "correct": "A platelet count of 90,000/mm3 indicates thrombocytopenia, a critical finding in preeclampsia that can lead to serious complications such as HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) and requires immediate intervention to prevent bleeding and further complications. This requires notifying the provider immediately.  Thrombocytopenia impairs the body's ability to form clots, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Immediate intervention may include administering platelets and closely monitoring the client's coagulation status.",

While continued monitoring is crucial to prevent toxicity, it does not require immediate intervention.  Magnesium sulfate is administered to prevent seizures in preeclamptic clients. Levels outside the therapeutic range require immediate intervention, but a level of 6.5 mg/dL is acceptable.",
