    "incorrect": "Administering insulin intravenously without adequate fluid resuscitation can lead to a rapid shift of potassium into cells, potentially causing life-threatening hypokalemia.  While insulin is necessary, it should be started after initial fluid resuscitation.  Administering a bolus of D50 is contraindicated as the patient is already severely hyperglycemic.  Monitoring urine output is important, but it is a secondary action to fluid resuscitation in this acute situation. Administering sodium bicarbonate requires arterial blood gas results to confirm severe acidosis (pH <7.0) and is not a first-line intervention.",
