        "correct": "Administering oxygen is the priority because the patient's SpO2 is 92% on room air, indicating hypoxia. Hypoxia in the setting of acute chest pain, especially with suspected myocardial ischemia, can worsen cardiac damage. Supplemental oxygen aims to improve oxygen delivery to the myocardium and reduce ischemic injury. ClinicalPearl: Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92% but avoid excessive oxygenation, which can be harmful.",
        "incorrect": "Starting an IV infusion of normal saline is not the immediate priority. While IV access is important for medication administration, addressing the patient's hypoxia takes precedence. Fluid bolus without clear indication could also worsen pulmonary edema if present. QuestionTrap: Students may choose this option because IV access is a common intervention, but it's not the MOST immediate need. Administering sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for chest pain, but it should be administered after ensuring adequate oxygenation and assessing blood pressure. Hypotension is a contraindication for nitroglycerin. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is crucial for diagnosing the cause of chest pain, but it should be done concurrently with or immediately after initiating oxygen therapy. The ECG findings will guide further management, such as thrombolytics or PCI. ClinicalPearl: Remember to check BP before administering nitroglycerin.",

            "Hypotension is a relative contraindication for nitroglycerin.",
