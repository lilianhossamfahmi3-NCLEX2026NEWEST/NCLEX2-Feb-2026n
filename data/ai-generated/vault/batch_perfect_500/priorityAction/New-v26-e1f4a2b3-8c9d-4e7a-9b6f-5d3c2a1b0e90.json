        "correct": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which reduces the right-to-left shunting of blood and improves pulmonary blood flow, thus increasing oxygen saturation. Administering morphine sulfate helps to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant, reducing their oxygen demand. Administering 100% oxygen can help to maximize the amount of oxygen available to the infant's tissues, even though the underlying problem is shunting. These actions directly address the physiological crisis of the tet spell by improving oxygenation and reducing the shunting of blood.",

        "incorrect": "Checking the IV site patency and infusion rate, while important for overall patient care, are not the priority actions during a hypercyanotic spell. The IV is already confirmed patent in the SBAR. Contacting the provider is important, but not the immediate priority. Initiating a fluid bolus may be necessary if the infant is dehydrated, but it is not the immediate priority in a hypercyanotic spell, and there is no indication of dehydration. Documenting the event is important but should occur after stabilizing the patient. Obtaining a blood gas is useful for further assessment but delays immediate interventions. Assessing the infant's pain level is important but secondary to addressing the immediate life-threatening hypoxemia.",

He was admitted for observation after a recent cardiac catheterization and has a history of cyanotic episodes. BACKGROUND: Liam's baseline oxygen saturation is typically between 75-80%. His mother reported increased fussiness and cyanosis around 14:00. ASSESSMENT: Current vital signs: Heart rate 180 bpm, Respiratory rate 60 breaths per minute, SpO2 65%, Temperature 37.8°C (100°F), Blood Pressure 90/60 mmHg. He exhibits circumoral cyanosis, increased work of breathing (nasal flaring, retractions), and draws his legs up to his chest. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. Intravenous access is patent, with D5W infusing at 10 mL/hr. Liam weighs 7 kg, and his hemoglobin is 18 g/dL. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate assessment by the attending physician or cardiologist. Consider administering morphine sulfate IV to alleviate pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant. Initiate knee-chest positioning to improve oxygen saturation. Be prepared for potential intubation and respiratory support if the infant's condition deteriorates.",
