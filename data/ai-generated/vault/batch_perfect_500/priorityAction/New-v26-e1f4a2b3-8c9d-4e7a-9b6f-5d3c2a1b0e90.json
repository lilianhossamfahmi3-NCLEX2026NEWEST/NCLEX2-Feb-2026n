Administering morphine sulfate helps to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant, reducing their oxygen demand. Administering 100% oxygen can help to maximize the amount of oxygen available to the infant's tissues, even though the underlying problem is shunting. These actions directly address the physiological crisis of the tet spell by improving oxygenation and reducing the shunting of blood.",

The IV is already confirmed patent in the SBAR. Contacting the provider is important, but not the immediate priority. Initiating a fluid bolus may be necessary if the infant is dehydrated, but it is not the immediate priority in a hypercyanotic spell, and there is no indication of dehydration. Documenting the event is important but should occur after stabilizing the patient. Obtaining a blood gas is useful for further assessment but delays immediate interventions. Assessing the infant's pain level is important but secondary to addressing the immediate life-threatening hypoxemia.",

        "sbar": "SITUATION: Liam Miller, a 6-month-old male infant with Tetralogy of Fallot, is admitted for observation following a recent cardiac catheterization. He has a history of cyanotic episodes. BACKGROUND: Liam's baseline oxygen saturation is typically between 75-80%. His mother reports increased fussiness and a noticeable increase in cyanosis that began around 14:00. ASSESSMENT: Current vital signs at 14:15 are as follows: Heart rate 180 bpm, Respiratory rate 60 breaths per minute, SpO2 65%, Temperature 37.8°C (100°F), and Blood Pressure 90/60 mmHg. The infant exhibits circumoral cyanosis and increased work of breathing, including nasal flaring and retractions. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur, consistent with his known cardiac condition. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. Intravenous access is patent, with D5W infusing at 10 mL/hr. Liam weighs 7 kg. His hemoglobin level is 18 g/dL. Further assessment reveals that Liam is drawing his legs up to his chest. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend an immediate assessment by the attending physician or cardiologist. Consider administering morphine sulfate IV to alleviate pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant. Initiate knee-chest positioning to improve oxygen saturation. Be prepared for potential intubation and respiratory support if the infant's condition deteriorates.",
