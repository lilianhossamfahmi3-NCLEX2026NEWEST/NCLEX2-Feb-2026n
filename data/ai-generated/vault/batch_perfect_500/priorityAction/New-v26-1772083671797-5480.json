    "correct": "Rapidly lowering the patient's blood pressure is crucial to protect the cerebral vasculature and prevent further damage in the setting of a possible stroke. The patient's BP is significantly elevated (210/110), increasing the risk of hemorrhagic conversion if thrombolytics are considered or worsening ischemia. Guidelines generally target a controlled reduction within a specific timeframe, often with a goal of <180/105 mmHg before and during thrombolytic administration.",

    "incorrect": "While notifying the neurologist is important, it has already been done per the SBAR. Assessing the gag reflex is important to prevent aspiration, but blood pressure control takes priority in this acute phase. Administering Warfarin would be contraindicated given the suspected stroke and the patient's elevated INR.",
