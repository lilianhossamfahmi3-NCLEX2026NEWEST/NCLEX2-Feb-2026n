The patient's BP is significantly elevated (210/110), increasing the risk of hemorrhagic conversion if thrombolytics are considered or worsening ischemia. Guidelines generally target a controlled reduction within a specific timeframe, often with a goal of <180/105 mmHg before and during thrombolytic administration.\n\nclinicalPearl: Hypertension management is critical in acute stroke care to minimize secondary brain injury.",
