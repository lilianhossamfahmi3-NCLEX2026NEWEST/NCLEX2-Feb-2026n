    "correct": "1. Administering labetalol IV: Elevated blood pressure post-alteplase increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion and cerebral edema. Strict blood pressure control is crucial. 2. Performing neurological assessment: Frequent neurological assessments (GCS, pupillary response, motor strength) are essential to monitor for deterioration and signs of increased ICP. 3. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees: Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps reduce ICP. 4. Initiating aspiration precautions: Stroke patients are at high risk for aspiration due to impaired swallowing and gag reflexes. Aspiration precautions, including positioning and diet modifications, are essential. 5. Administering acetaminophen for temperature >100.4°F: Fever increases metabolic demands and can exacerbate neurological damage. Controlling fever is important, but less urgent than addressing blood pressure, neurological status, and aspiration risk.",

    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen for temperature >100.4°F: While important, addressing fever is a lower priority than managing blood pressure, monitoring neurological status, and preventing aspiration in the acute post-alteplase phase of an ischemic stroke. Initiating aspiration precautions: Although important, this is secondary to controlling BP and neurological assessment. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees: While helpful to decrease ICP, it is secondary to BP control and neurological assessment after thrombolytic administration. Performing neurological assessment: While important, this is secondary to BP control after thrombolytic administration. Administering labetalol IV: While important, this is secondary to neurological assessment following thrombolytic administration.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "The question trap is to focus solely on the neurological deficits and overlook the crucial blood pressure management required post-alteplase administration. Students might prioritize interventions directly related to neurological function without recognizing the immediate threat of hemorrhagic conversion due to elevated BP.",
      "howToOvercome": "To overcome this trap, consider the time-sensitive nature of post-alteplase care. Remember the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and recognize that uncontrolled hypertension can quickly lead to life-threatening complications like hemorrhagic stroke. Always prioritize interventions that address immediate threats to patient stability before addressing secondary issues."

CT scan at 08:30 confirmed acute ischemic stroke, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Pt received IV alteplase at 09:00. A: Currently, GCS is 13 (E3, V4, M6). BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 94% on room air. Pupils are equal and reactive, but right-sided facial droop is present. Weakness noted in right arm and leg (2/5 strength). Patient is alert but intermittently confused. R: I'm concerned about potential for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and further neurological deterioration. Need orders for blood pressure management, frequent neuro checks, and potential interventions for increased ICP.",
