        "correct": "Administering a bolus of IV fluids is the most appropriate initial action. The patient's hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 110 bpm), coupled with decreased urine output (20 mL/hr), indicate hypovolemia and decreased kidney perfusion. Addressing the hypovolemia with IV fluids will help improve blood pressure and renal perfusion, which is critical in managing AKI. Prompt intervention can prevent further kidney damage and improve patient outcomes. The goal is to increase circulating volume to improve renal perfusion and support kidney function. This aligns with the immediate need to stabilize the patient's circulatory status.",
        "incorrect": "Placing the patient on oxygen is not indicated as the patient's SpO2 is 94% on room air, which is within acceptable limits. The priority is to address the hypotension and low urine output to improve kidney perfusion. While oxygen support might be considered if the SpO2 drops below acceptable levels, it is not the initial action needed in this scenario. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, but this is likely compensatory to the hypovolemia and does not warrant immediate oxygen administration.",
