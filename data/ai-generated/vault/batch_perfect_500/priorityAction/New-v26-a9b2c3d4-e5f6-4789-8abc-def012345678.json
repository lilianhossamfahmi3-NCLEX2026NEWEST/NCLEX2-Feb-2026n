        "correct": "1. Auscultate lung sounds bilaterally: This is the priority action to assess the cause of the high-pressure alarm and diminished breath sounds. Knowing the specific location and quality of breath sounds is essential for guiding subsequent interventions. 2. Suction the endotracheal tube: Diminished breath sounds and a high-pressure alarm suggest possible airway obstruction from secretions. Suctioning aims to clear the obstruction and improve ventilation. 3. Assess endotracheal tube placement: The high-pressure alarm and unilateral diminished breath sounds could indicate displacement of the ET tube, potentially into the right main bronchus. Checking the cm marking at the lip and comparing it to previous documentation is important, as is chest X-ray evaluation. 4. Notify the respiratory therapist: RTs are experts in ventilator management and can provide valuable assistance in troubleshooting ventilator alarms and optimizing settings in collaboration with the nurse and physician. Early involvement ensures comprehensive care. 5. Obtain a STAT chest X-ray: This will confirm ET tube placement and identify any other underlying pulmonary issues, such as a pneumothorax or worsening pneumonia, contributing to the patient's respiratory distress. It is important to have a baseline to compare the current CXR to.",

        "incorrect": "Delaying auscultation means delaying data collection, a high risk action. Delaying suctioning when the assessment indicates a potential mucus plug will cause unnecessary hypoxemia. Delaying assessment of ET tube placement and chest X-ray can delay the discovery of potentially life threatening problems. Notifying RT late in the order misses an opportunity for expertise in complex problems. Completing a chest x-ray first before auscultation and suctioning is prioritizing diagnosis over immediate intervention.",

His current respiratory rate is 24, FiO2 is 40%, PEEP is 5 cm H2O, and Tidal Volume is 450 mL. A: He has a history of COPD and hypertension. At 07:00, his ABG results were: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 85 mmHg, HCO3 26 mEq/L, and SpO2 94%. At 07:15, the high-pressure alarm activated on the ventilator. B: Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side. His BP is 160/90 mmHg, and his HR is 110 bpm. O: The patient is restless and appears uncomfortable. The endotracheal tube is secured at 22 cm at the lip. A chest X-ray order has been placed, and the image will be available in the EHR shortly. I need you to immediately evaluate the patient, focusing on the cause of the high-pressure alarm and diminished breath sounds. Please adjust ventilator settings as needed, in collaboration with respiratory therapy, to improve ventilation and oxygenation based on your assessment findings.",
