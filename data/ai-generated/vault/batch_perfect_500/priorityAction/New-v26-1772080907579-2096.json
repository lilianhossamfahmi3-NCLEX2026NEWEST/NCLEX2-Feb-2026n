        "correct": "Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine and a first-line medication for terminating active seizures. Rapid administration is crucial to prevent prolonged seizure activity and potential neurological damage. Lorazepam enhances GABA-A receptor activity, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability, effectively stopping the seizure.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Delaying administration of lorazepam can lead to status epilepticus, which carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. While other interventions are important, stopping the seizure takes precedence. Status epilepticus can cause irreversible brain damage due to prolonged neuronal excitation and metabolic stress.",

            "reason": "Delaying treatment to obtain a CT scan or other diagnostic tests during an active seizure could result in further neurological damage. The priority is to stop the seizure to prevent further complications."
