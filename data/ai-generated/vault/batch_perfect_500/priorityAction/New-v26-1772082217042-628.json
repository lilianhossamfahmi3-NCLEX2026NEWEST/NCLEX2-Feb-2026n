Starting with a low flow rate (2L/min via nasal cannula) is appropriate for COPD patients to avoid suppressing their hypoxic drive. The goal is to increase SpO2 to between 88-92%.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen therapy can lead to worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure. While bronchodilators are important for COPD, addressing the immediate hypoxemia with oxygen is the higher priority. Higher flow rates or different oxygen delivery devices might be needed later, but initiating with a low flow rate via nasal cannula is the safest initial approach for a COPD patient to avoid hypercapnia.",
