    "correct": "The correct order of actions prioritizes restoring fluid volume, initiating insulin therapy, addressing electrolyte imbalances, monitoring the patient's response to treatment, and providing supportive care. 1. **Initiate the regular insulin IV drip:** The client's extremely elevated glucose level necessitates immediate insulin administration to facilitate glucose uptake by cells and prevent further hyperglycemia. 2. **Administer 0.9% NaCl at 250 mL/hr:** HHS leads to severe dehydration due to osmotic diuresis. Rapid fluid replacement is crucial to restore intravascular volume, improve renal perfusion, and correct hyperosmolarity. 3. **Administer potassium chloride (KCl) per protocol:** HHS often presents with hypokalemia due to urinary losses and insulin's intracellular shift of potassium. Replacing potassium is essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. 4. **Monitor blood glucose hourly:** Frequent glucose monitoring is necessary to assess the effectiveness of insulin therapy and adjust the infusion rate as needed to achieve a gradual reduction in glucose levels, avoiding rapid changes that could lead to cerebral edema. 5. **Assess neurological status frequently:** Given the patient's altered mental status, frequent neurological assessments are vital to detect any worsening of cerebral function, which may indicate cerebral edema or other complications.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of the immediate priorities in managing HHS.
