The patient's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Kayexalate helps to remove potassium from the body by exchanging sodium ions for potassium ions in the intestine, which is then excreted through the feces. This action helps to rapidly decrease serum potassium levels and stabilize cardiac function.",
