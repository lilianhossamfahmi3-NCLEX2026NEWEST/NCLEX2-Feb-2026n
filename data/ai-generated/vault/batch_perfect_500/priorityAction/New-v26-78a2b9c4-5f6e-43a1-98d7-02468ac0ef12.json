        "correct": "Auscultating bilateral breath sounds is crucial to assess for potential pneumothorax, which is suggested by the decreased breath sounds on the left. This warrants immediate investigation. Assessing the patient's level of sedation is important since the patient is fighting the ventilator. Inadequate sedation can cause increased agitation and asynchrony. Reviewing the chest x-ray report helps rule out or confirm the presence of a pneumothorax, which can cause increased airway pressures. Notifying the provider to evaluate for a pneumothorax is necessary to initiate appropriate interventions, such as a chest tube insertion.",

        "incorrect": "Increasing the FiO2 is not the immediate priority. While the SpO2 is slightly low at 90%, addressing the underlying cause of the high-pressure alarm and potential pneumothorax is paramount. Increasing the tidal volume could worsen the situation if the patient has a pneumothorax or increased airway resistance. Administering a bronchodilator is premature without first assessing for other causes of the high-pressure alarm. While the patient has a history of COPD, the current presentation suggests a more acute issue. Documenting the findings is important, but not the immediate priority. Actions to address the patient's distress and potential pneumothorax must take precedence.",
