        "correct": "The patient's decreasing GCS, rising blood pressure, and sluggish pupils strongly suggest increased ICP and impending herniation. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Notifying the provider is crucial for obtaining orders for interventions like mannitol or hypertonic saline and further diagnostic testing (CT scan). Administering oxygen ensures adequate cerebral perfusion. Preparing for intubation is a proactive measure in case the patient's respiratory status deteriorates due to increasing ICP. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect further changes.",

        "sbar": "S: Jameson Elder is a 72-year-old male admitted at 02:00 today due to an acute ischemic stroke affecting the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). He has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hyperlipidemia. R: Alteplase was administered at 02:30. We are performing hourly neurological checks and maintaining his blood pressure according to stroke protocol. B: At 07:00, Mr. Elder exhibited increased lethargy, with his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) decreasing from a baseline of 15 to 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5). He also presents with new right-sided weakness. His pupils are now sluggishly reactive to light. His current vital signs are BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 60 bpm, RR 12 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, and temperature 37.2°C. The most recent lab values are available in the 'Labs' tab. A: I am concerned about increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to the stroke. He likely requires orders for medications such as mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce the ICP. There is a potential risk of brain herniation, which necessitates immediate intervention to prevent further neurological damage. Please advise on further management and necessary orders. He also had Alteplase infused at 0.9mg/kg.",
