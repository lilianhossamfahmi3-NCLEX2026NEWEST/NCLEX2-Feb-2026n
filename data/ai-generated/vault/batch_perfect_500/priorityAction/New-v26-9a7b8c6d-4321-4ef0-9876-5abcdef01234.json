    "correct": "1. Titrate Nicardipine IV drip: Rapidly lowering blood pressure is crucial to reducing cerebral edema and preventing further neurological damage. The SBP >160 mmHg needs immediate attention to prevent further increases in ICP and the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. 2. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees: This promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Elevating the head of the bed is a fundamental nursing intervention for patients with increased ICP. 3. Administer Acetaminophen: Elevated temperature can increase metabolic demand in the brain, exacerbating ICP. Reducing fever is essential to minimize further neurological damage and improve patient outcomes. 4. Decrease environmental stimuli: Minimizing external stimuli can help reduce agitation and prevent further increases in ICP. The patient is already restless and confused, which can further increase ICP. Reducing stimuli will help to calm the patient and prevent further exacerbation of ICP.",

    "incorrect": "Administering Acetaminophen before controlling the blood pressure is incorrect because uncontrolled hypertension contributes directly to increased ICP and potential hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of a stroke. Decreasing environmental stimuli should only be done AFTER addressing the hypertension, because the hypertension is causing the increase in ICP and addressing that is most important.",

      "trap": "Students may prioritize administering acetaminophen first if they focus solely on the elevated temperature without recognizing the immediate threat posed by uncontrolled hypertension.",
      "howToOvercome": "Focus on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and then neurological status. Uncontrolled hypertension is a direct threat to cerebral perfusion and can lead to further neurological damage. Also, think about the pathophysiology of increased ICP and the interventions that directly address that."

    "sbar": "S: Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old male who was admitted at 07:00 today due to right-sided weakness and slurred speech, with a suspected diagnosis of an ischemic stroke. B: His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He received his last dose of lisinopril 20mg PO at 06:00 this morning. A: At 10:00, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 12 (E3, V4, M5). The right-sided weakness persists, and the patient is exhibiting increasing restlessness and confusion. His current vital signs are: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 24 and labored, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, and Temp 37.5°C. Neurological checks reveal that his pupils are equal at 3mm but are sluggishly reactive to light. Lab results are pending. A: Based on the assessment data, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is suspected. The immediate interventions include frequent assessment of the patient's level of consciousness (LOC), administration of antihypertensive medications as prescribed, elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees, and preparation for potential intubation if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates further. Close monitoring is essential.",
