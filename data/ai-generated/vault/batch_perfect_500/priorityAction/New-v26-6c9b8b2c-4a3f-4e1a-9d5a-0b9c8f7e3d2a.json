Assess respiratory status and airway patency: Given the patient's labored breathing, decreased SpO2, and potential for worsening encephalopathy, ensuring a patent airway and adequate ventilation is the immediate priority. 2. Administer lactulose: Lactulose helps reduce ammonia levels, which contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. The elevated ammonia level in the lab results supports this intervention. 3. Monitor neurological status frequently: Frequent neurological assessments are crucial to detect changes in mental status and response to treatment. Worsening encephalopathy may require further intervention. 4. Initiate safety precautions: Due to the patient's confusion and disorientation, implementing safety measures such as bed alarms and side rails is important to prevent falls and injuries. 5. Monitor fluid balance and electrolytes: Patients with liver failure are at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate their condition. Monitoring these parameters is essential for guiding treatment.",

A: At 07:00, his vital signs are: BP 90/60, HR 110, RR 24 and labored, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.9°C. Labs show elevated ammonia (200 mcg/dL), bilirubin (15 mg/dL), and prolonged PT/INR. He's drowsy but arousable to voice. He has asterixis. Ascites is present. R: I'm concerned about worsening hepatic encephalopathy and potential airway compromise. I recommend STAT lactulose administration, further assessment of his mental status, and potential intubation if his respiratory status declines. Please review the labs and MAR.",
