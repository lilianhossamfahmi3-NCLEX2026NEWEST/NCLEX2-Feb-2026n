Administer Labetalol 20mg IV per PRN order: The patient's blood pressure is consistently above 160/100 mmHg, requiring immediate intervention with antihypertensive medication to prevent complications such as stroke or eclampsia. Labetalol is indicated for severe hypertension in postpartum preeclampsia. \n3. Massage the fundus and assess for bladder distention: A boggy fundus and deviated uterus indicate uterine atony and potential bladder distention, both contributing to postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contraction, and emptying the bladder allows the uterus to contract properly. \n4. Assess for signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity: While magnesium sulfate is crucial for preventing seizures, it can lead to toxicity, especially with impaired renal function (elevated creatinine). Assessing for decreased respiratory rate, absent reflexes, and altered mental status is essential.",
