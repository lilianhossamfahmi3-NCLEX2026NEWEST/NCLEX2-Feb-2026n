        "correct": "1. Administer labetalol IV to lower blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated (210/110 mmHg), increasing the risk of further neurological damage and potential hemorrhagic conversion. Rapid but controlled blood pressure reduction is crucial. 2. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk for further cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring allows for prompt detection and management of arrhythmias. 3. Maintain NPO status: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to dysarthria and potential dysphagia. Maintaining NPO status until a swallow evaluation is completed is essential to prevent aspiration pneumonia. 4. Administer aspirin 325 mg PO: Aspirin is indicated for acute ischemic stroke to prevent further clot formation and improve outcomes. It should be administered as soon as possible after ruling out hemorrhage. 5. Perform frequent neurological assessments: Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., NIHSS) are crucial to monitor for changes in the patient's condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. 6. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees: Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which may help to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) and improve cerebral perfusion.",
