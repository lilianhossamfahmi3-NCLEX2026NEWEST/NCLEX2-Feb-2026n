    "correct": "Rapid acquisition of a CT scan is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This determines eligibility for tPA, a time-sensitive treatment that can significantly improve outcomes in ischemic stroke. Delaying the CT scan delays treatment.",

Lowering the blood pressure is important but must be done cautiously and after ruling out hemorrhage. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is a standard part of the stroke workup but does not take priority over imaging to determine stroke type.",
