The nurse should immediately assess the fundus for firmness and position, and quantify the lochia (color, amount, presence of clots) to determine the source and extent of the bleeding. A boggy uterus can contribute to hemorrhage. Further interventions will be based on this assessment, such as fundal massage or medication administration. Vital signs, while important, are secondary to the immediate assessment of the bleeding source.",
        "incorrect": "While vital signs are important, assessing the fundus and lochia is the priority to determine the cause of the heavy bleeding. Documenting the finding is important, but not the priority action. Increasing IV fluids may be necessary later, but the immediate action is to assess the bleeding. Calling the provider is important, but first assess the patient.",
