Decreased urine output is a more critical indicator of potential water intoxication. | An elevated heart rate is not the most concerning finding in this scenario. Decreased urine output is a more critical indicator of potential water intoxication. | Increased thirst is expected with diabetes insipidus, but the decreased urine output suggests the vasopressin is working too well and causing fluid retention, which is a more immediate threat.",
