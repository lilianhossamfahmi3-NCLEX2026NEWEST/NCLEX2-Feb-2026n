    "correct": "1. Initiate one-on-one continuous observation: Continuous observation is paramount for patients expressing suicidal ideation, even without an active plan, to prevent self-harm. 2. Remove potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment: Eliminating access to items that could be used for self-harm, such as sharp objects or cords, is a crucial safety measure. 3. Contact the on-call psychiatrist for immediate evaluation: A psychiatric evaluation is essential to assess the patient's mental state, determine the severity of the suicide risk, and develop an appropriate treatment plan. 4. Administer lorazepam 1mg PO PRN for anxiety: Anxiety can exacerbate suicidal ideation. PRN medication can help manage acute anxiety symptoms while awaiting psychiatric evaluation. 5. Encourage the patient to verbalize feelings and concerns: Therapeutic communication can help the patient feel heard and understood, potentially reducing feelings of isolation and hopelessness.",

    "incorrect": "Delaying continuous observation could result in immediate self-harm. Skipping the removal of harmful objects leaves the patient at risk. Postponing the psychiatric evaluation will delay crucial assessment and treatment. Prioritizing medication administration over safety measures is inappropriate. Failing to encourage verbalization of feelings neglects the therapeutic aspect of care.",
