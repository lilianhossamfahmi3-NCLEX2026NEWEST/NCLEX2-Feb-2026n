Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to restore circulating volume and improve blood pressure. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position (modified) can help improve venous return to the heart. Administering oxygen addresses the hypoxemia indicated by the SpO2 of 92%. Notifying the surgeon is essential for further evaluation and intervention to address the source of bleeding. Monitoring vital signs closely allows for continuous assessment of the patient's response to interventions. These actions are aimed at stabilizing the patient and preventing further deterioration.",

He appears pale and diaphoretic. The surgical dressing has a moderate amount of sanguineous drainage. Urine output is now 15 mL/hr. The patient reports feeling dizzy. A: I suspect hypovolemic shock secondary to possible post-operative bleeding. R: I recommend STAT blood draw for CBC, CMP, and coagulation studies. I also recommend initiating rapid fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and notifying the surgeon immediately. Please evaluate the patient urgently.",
