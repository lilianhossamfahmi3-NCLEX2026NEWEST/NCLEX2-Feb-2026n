    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The patient is hypoxic (SpO2 88%) and requires supplemental oxygen to improve oxygen saturation. Starting at a low flow rate (2 L/min) via nasal cannula is appropriate to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive in a COPD patient. Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92%.",

            "acronym": "LOW O2",
            "meaning": "Low Oxygen for COPD (start low and titrate)"
        },
        "incorrect": "Increasing the flow rate too quickly can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to further CO2 retention. Waiting to initiate oxygen therapy could worsen the patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress. A non-rebreather mask is too aggressive initially and not indicated at this stage. Administering IV fluids is not directly indicated for hypoxia and could worsen respiratory distress in a patient with COPD.",

            "reasoning": "Students may be inclined to choose the most effective oxygen delivery method without considering the underlying physiology of COPD.",
