  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The patient is hypoxic (SpO2 88%) and requires supplemental oxygen to improve oxygen saturation. Starting at a low flow rate (2 L/min) via nasal cannula is appropriate to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive in a COPD patient.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "acronym": "LOW O2",
      "meaning": "Low Oxygen for COPD (start low and titrate)"
    },
    "incorrect": "Increasing the flow rate too quickly can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to further CO2 retention. Waiting to initiate oxygen therapy could worsen the patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress.  A non-rebreather mask is too aggressive initially and not indicated at this stage. Administering IV fluids is not directly indicated for hypoxia and could worsen respiratory distress in a patient with COPD.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reasoning": "Students may be inclined to choose the most effective oxygen delivery method without considering the underlying physiology of COPD.",
      "commonMistake": "Selecting higher flow oxygen delivery methods without considering the risk of suppressing the hypoxic drive in a COPD patient."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "COPD patients rely on hypoxia to stimulate breathing; high oxygen concentrations can suppress this drive.",
