Administering IV insulin and glucose is the most immediate action to temporarily shift potassium into cells. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage any arrhythmias. Preparing for dialysis is a longer-term solution but not the immediate priority. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important to assess for cardiac changes related to hyperkalemia, but it is secondary to immediate treatment. Administering Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Kayexalate) is also appropriate but slower-acting than IV insulin/glucose.",

He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Background: The patient's chronic kidney disease is long-standing, complicated by a recent acute decline in kidney function. He also has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessment: At 0530, the patient complained of muscle weakness and palpitations. Current vital signs at 0545 are: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 37.2°C. Urine output last hour was 20 mL. Labs are pending but concerning for hyperkalemia based on symptoms. The patient is alert and oriented x3 but anxious. Telemetry is in place, monitoring for arrhythmias. Recommendation: I have already notified the provider about the patient's condition and lab results. I am requesting guidance on immediate nursing interventions to address the possible hyperkalemia and decreased blood pressure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.",
