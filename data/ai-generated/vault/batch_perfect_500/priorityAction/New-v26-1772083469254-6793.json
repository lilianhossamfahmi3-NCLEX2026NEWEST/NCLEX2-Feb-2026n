Given the CKD, close monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function is crucial. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, rapidly reduces fluid volume, alleviating pulmonary congestion and edema associated with heart failure or kidney dysfunction. This action directly counters the patient's presenting symptoms of shortness of breath and elevated blood pressure.",
