        "correct": "Monitoring the client's fluid balance is the priority because diabetes insipidus causes excessive fluid loss, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent complications such as hypovolemic shock and electrolyte abnormalities. By closely tracking intake and output, daily weights, and serum osmolality, the nurse can detect early signs of dehydration and intervene appropriately with fluid replacement. This proactive approach helps stabilize the client's condition and prevent further deterioration.",
        "mnemonic": "DI: Dry Inside (dehydration)",
        "incorrect": "While administering desmopressin is important for managing diabetes insipidus, it is not the immediate priority if the client is already dehydrated. Fluid balance must be addressed first to prevent further complications. Assessing neurological status is important, but not the priority over addressing the immediate threat of dehydration. Neurological changes may occur secondary to severe dehydration, but the primary focus should be on restoring fluid volume. Checking blood glucose is not the priority for diabetes insipidus, as it primarily affects fluid balance, not glucose metabolism. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive water loss, not glucose dysregulation.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking about medication administration or neurological assessment, but the priority is always to address the immediate threat to the patient's physiological stability, which in this case is dehydration. Recognizing the potential for rapid dehydration and its associated complications is key to selecting the correct answer.",
