  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The patient's low oxygen saturation (88%) and signs of respiratory distress (increased respiratory rate, wheezing, crackles) indicate hypoxemia that requires intervention. Initiating low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula is the appropriate first step to improve oxygenation while monitoring the patient's response.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen therapy could lead to further hypoxia and potential complications such as organ damage. While further interventions may be necessary, addressing the immediate hypoxemia is the priority.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory effort closely after initiating oxygen therapy.",
      "Titrate oxygen flow rate to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90-94% as prescribed (or facility policy).",
      "Assess for signs of carbon dioxide retention, especially in patients with COPD, and be prepared to adjust oxygen delivery if necessary."

    "questionTrap": {
      "distractor": "A common distractor would be to immediately increase the oxygen flow to a higher level (e.g., 6 L/min) without assessing the patient's response to a lower flow rate first, especially in COPD patients at risk for CO2 retention.",
      "reason": "Starting with a lower flow rate allows for careful monitoring of the patient's response and minimizes the risk of hypercapnia in susceptible individuals."
