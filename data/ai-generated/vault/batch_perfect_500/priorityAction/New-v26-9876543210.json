    "correct": "1. **Notify the physician/provider immediately:** The rapid decline in respiratory status, indicated by worsening ABGs and increased respiratory distress, requires immediate medical intervention. 2. **Prepare for intubation and mechanical ventilation:** The patient's PaO2 of 58 on 60% FiO2 indicates severe hypoxemia, and rising PaCO2 suggests respiratory failure. Intubation and ventilation are likely necessary. 3. **Increase FiO2 to 100% via bag-valve-mask:** While preparing for intubation, maximizing oxygen delivery is crucial. Using a bag-valve-mask with 100% FiO2 provides the highest possible oxygen concentration. 4. **Administer a sedative (if ordered) as prescribed:** Sedation is often necessary before intubation to facilitate the procedure and reduce patient anxiety and resistance. 5. **Document the patient's response to interventions:** Accurate and timely documentation is essential for tracking the patient's progress and informing further treatment decisions. Documenting vital signs, respiratory status, and interventions implemented provides a clear picture of the patient's clinical course.",

    "incorrect": "Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is contraindicated as it can worsen respiratory distress. Administering another dose of furosemide could lead to hypovolemia in the setting of already low blood pressure. Requesting a chest x-ray is important, but not the priority action in this acute situation. Titrating morphine would suppress the respiratory drive and is dangerous, especially with the patient's PaCO2 being high already. Obtaining a sputum culture is important for identifying the causative organism of the pneumonia, but is not a priority in this acute situation.",

    "sbar": "S: Robert Miller, a 68-year-old male, was admitted three days ago with pneumonia and is now suspected of having Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). His oxygen saturation is persistently dropping despite increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). His current blood pressure is 100/60, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 36 and labored. At 1700, he is exhibiting increasing dyspnea and agitation.\n\nB: Mr. Miller has a history of hypertension and COPD. He was initially treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. However, his respiratory status has progressively worsened despite treatment.\n\nA: The patient is likely progressing to severe ARDS, not responding to current interventions. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2 of 58 mmHg on FiO2 of 60% via Venturi mask. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 5 cm H2O. Lung sounds reveal diffuse crackles. The patient is on continuous cardiac monitoring.\n\nR: I am requesting orders for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation, increased PEEP, and sedation. We also need to rule out other causes of respiratory failure, such as pulmonary embolism. Please assess current ventilator settings and patient response after interventions. I recommend initiating airborne precautions until infectious etiologies are ruled out, given the pneumonia and potential for atypical pathogens.",
