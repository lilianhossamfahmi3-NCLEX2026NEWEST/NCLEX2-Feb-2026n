        "correct": "The priority actions in thyroid storm involve addressing the hypermetabolic state. Administering a beta-blocker (propranolol) helps to control tachycardia and reduce the effects of excessive thyroid hormones on the heart. Initiating cooling measures (cooling blanket) is crucial to reduce the dangerously high body temperature. Administering an antithyroid medication (PTU or methimazole) blocks further synthesis of thyroid hormones. Providing IV fluids (normal saline bolus) addresses dehydration from fever and diaphoresis and supports blood pressure. Administering oxygen supplementation via a non-rebreather mask addresses the increased oxygen demand due to the hypermetabolic state and the patient's compromised respiratory status.",

        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen addresses fever but is less effective than active cooling measures in this acute situation. Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated due to the patient's altered mental status and risk of aspiration. Monitoring blood glucose is important, but not a *first* priority when the patient is not hypoglycemic and the primary concern is the thyroid storm itself. Elevating the head of the bed may improve oxygenation, but active oxygen supplementation is a higher priority. Administering a diuretic will further dehydrate the patient and is not indicated in this scenario.",

Patient has a history of Graves' disease but reports non-compliance with medications. B: Patient's daughter states that Ms. Vance has been increasingly agitated and confused over the past 24 hours. She also reports a high fever she measured at home. A: On assessment at 06:15, patient is tachycardic (HR 160 bpm), hypertensive (BP 180/100 mmHg), temperature 104.5°F (40.3°C), and exhibiting tremors. She is diaphoretic and restless. Oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Mental status is fluctuating; at times she is oriented to person only. R: I suspect thyroid storm. I have initiated continuous cardiac monitoring and obtained stat labs. I recommend immediate intervention to address hyperthermia, tachycardia, and potential respiratory compromise. Orders for IV fluids, antithyroid medications, and beta-blockers are pending. Oxygen per nasal cannula has been initiated at 2LPM.",
