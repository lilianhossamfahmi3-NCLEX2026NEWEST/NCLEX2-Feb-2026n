        "correct": "Monitor the patient's serum potassium level and administer potassium replacement as prescribed. DKA causes intracellular potassium to shift extracellularly, leading to a falsely normal or elevated serum potassium level. As acidosis is corrected with insulin, potassium shifts back into the cells, potentially causing life-threatening hypokalemia. Therefore, monitoring and correcting potassium levels is crucial to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory muscle weakness.",

Administering sodium bicarbonate is not always indicated in DKA and can worsen intracellular acidosis in some cases. Assessing urine output is important for monitoring fluid balance, but it's secondary to addressing the potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalance.",
