        "correct": "1. **Auscultate the patient's lungs bilaterally:** This is the priority action to assess for pneumothorax or other causes of unequal breath sounds. Diminished breath sounds on the left side, coupled with increased peak inspiratory pressure, are concerning for a pneumothorax. 2. **Manually ventilate the patient with a bag-valve-mask:** If the high-pressure alarm is triggered and the cause is unclear or cannot be immediately resolved, manually ventilating ensures adequate oxygenation and ventilation while troubleshooting. This also allows for assessment of lung compliance. 3. **Notify the physician and request a STAT chest x-ray:** Based on the assessment findings (diminished breath sounds, increased PIP, and desaturation), a chest x-ray is crucial to confirm or rule out a pneumothorax. 4. **Assess the patient for signs of a pneumothorax (e.g., tracheal deviation, subcutaneous emphysema):** This assessment further evaluates the likelihood of a pneumothorax, informing the urgency of interventions. 5. **Suction the patient's airway:** While mucus plugging is a possibility, it is lower priority than ruling out a pneumothorax, especially given the unilateral diminished breath sounds. Suctioning can improve airway patency if mucus is present, but should not delay more critical interventions.",
