Begin continuous regular insulin infusion to gradually reduce blood glucose levels. A slow and steady decrease prevents rapid shifts in osmolality, which can cause cerebral edema.\n3. Monitor potassium levels and administer potassium chloride as prescribed. Insulin administration shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially leading to hypokalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias.\n4. Monitor vital signs and neurological status frequently. Close monitoring is essential to detect changes in BP, HR, RR, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness, indicating response to treatment or complications.\n5. Obtain and analyze arterial blood gas (ABG) results. While the VBG has already been performed, the nurse may still need to assist the provider in analyzing the data. Monitoring acid-base balance helps to assess the effectiveness of treatment and detect metabolic acidosis.",

Rapidly lowering blood glucose without addressing dehydration can cause cerebral edema. Failing to correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Infrequent monitoring can delay the detection of complications. ABG analysis is important, but it is more important to immediately address fluid and electrolyte imbalances.",

Current lab results show a blood glucose of 850 mg/dL and serum osmolality of 340 mOsm/kg. Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28 and deep, labored breathing. Urine output has been minimal (30 ml total) in the last 2 hours. The patient presents as confused and lethargic.\n\nHe is currently on a cardiac monitor and receiving O2 via nasal cannula at 2 LPM, maintaining SpO2 at 92%. The provider was notified at 04:15 and ordered IV fluids (0.9% NaCl), a continuous insulin infusion, and electrolyte monitoring. A STAT BMP and VBG were also ordered. At 04:30, the provider reassessed Mr. Jones and emphasized the importance of addressing his dehydration and hyperglycemia as the immediate priorities. Based on initial assessment, the possibility of an infectious process, such as pneumonia, should be considered due to altered mental status and labored breathing.",
