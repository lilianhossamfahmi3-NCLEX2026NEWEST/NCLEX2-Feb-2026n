    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Administer intramuscular epinephrine. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it rapidly reverses the life-threatening effects of the allergic reaction. It works by constricting blood vessels to raise blood pressure, relaxing smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing, reducing swelling, and stimulating the heart. In acute respiratory distress due to anaphylaxis, immediate epinephrine administration can be life-saving.",
        "incorrect": "Auscultate lung sounds. Assessing lung sounds is important for gathering additional information about the patient's respiratory status, but it should not delay the administration of epinephrine in a patient experiencing acute respiratory distress due to anaphylaxis. Action must be taken immediately to reverse the anaphylactic reaction.",
        "option_3": "Apply oxygen via nasal cannula. While supplemental oxygen is beneficial in managing respiratory distress, it does not address the underlying cause of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the priority to reverse the systemic effects of the allergic reaction.",
        "option_4": "Administer an antihistamine. Antihistamines can help with some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching and hives, but they are not effective in treating the acute respiratory distress associated with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the priority in this situation.",
