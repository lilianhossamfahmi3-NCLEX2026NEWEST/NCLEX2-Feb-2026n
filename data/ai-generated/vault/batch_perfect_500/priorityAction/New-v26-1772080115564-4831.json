The mother reports a history of asthma, well-controlled with daily inhaled corticosteroids. Upon arrival, the patient's respiratory rate was elevated at 32 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed diffuse wheezing bilaterally. An albuterol nebulizer treatment was initiated immediately. At 14:15, after the nebulizer treatment, the patient's oxygen saturation improved slightly to 90%, but the respiratory rate remained elevated.
