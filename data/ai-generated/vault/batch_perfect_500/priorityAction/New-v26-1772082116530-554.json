        "correct": "Massage the fundus. Fundal massage is the priority intervention for a boggy fundus, as it stimulates uterine contractions to control bleeding. Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, and prompt intervention is crucial to prevent further blood loss and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock. Massaging the fundus helps the uterus to contract and compress the blood vessels, thereby reducing bleeding.",
