Administering nitroglycerin to a hypoxic patient can worsen ischemia.\n\nquestionTrap: Prioritizing pain medication before assessing oxygenation and cardiac rhythm is incorrect. While pain management is important, stabilizing the patient is paramount. Addressing the patient's oxygenation is more critical than immediately managing pain.
