    "correct": "Administer furosemide 40mg IV push immediately. The patient is exhibiting signs of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema and hyperkalemia (based on labs). Rapid diuresis is essential to reduce fluid overload and improve respiratory status. The ABG results point to respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, which needs immediate intervention.",
