    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The patient's low oxygen saturation (88% on room air) and arterial blood gas results (PaO2 of 60 mmHg) indicate hypoxemia, necessitating supplemental oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation and prevent further respiratory compromise. Starting with a low flow of 2L/min via nasal cannula is appropriate, especially considering the patient's COPD history, to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive.",

        "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen therapy could lead to worsening hypoxemia and potential organ damage. Higher flow rates might be considered later, but starting low is prudent due to the patient's COPD history and risk of CO2 retention.",

            "trap": "Hesitating to administer oxygen due to concern for CO2 retention, even with documented hypoxemia, is a common but dangerous trap.",
            "explanation": "While caution is warranted, withholding oxygen from a hypoxemic patient is harmful. Start with low flow and monitor closely. The benefits of oxygenation generally outweigh the risks of CO2 retention in the acute setting."
