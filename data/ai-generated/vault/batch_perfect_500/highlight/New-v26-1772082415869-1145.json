This value falls significantly outside the acceptable range (80-100 mmHg) and signifies critical respiratory compromise, demanding urgent action such as increasing oxygen delivery or considering mechanical ventilation. Prompt intervention is crucial to avert further deterioration and potential life-threatening complications.\n\n",

Antibiotics are already ordered, addressing the underlying infection. The patient's elevated temperature requires intervention to manage fever and prevent complications, but is less immediately life-threatening than the low PaO2. While the rapid heart rate is concerning and may indicate hypovolemia or cardiac stress, the low PaO2 presents a more immediate threat to the patient's well-being.",
