    "correct": "The patient's low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg) and elevated heart rate (120 bpm) indicate hypovolemia, a common complication of pancreatitis due to fluid shifts and third spacing. The elevated WBC count (18,000/mm3) suggests a systemic inflammatory response and possible infection, which can occur with pancreatic necrosis. The decreased SpO2 (92%) and increased respiratory rate (28) are indicative of potential ARDS or pulmonary complications due to inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. The elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.0 mg/dL) suggest acute kidney injury, often caused by hypovolemia and decreased renal perfusion. The decreased calcium level (7.0 mg/dL) is indicative of calcium saponification due to enzymatic fat necrosis.",

    "incorrect": "While elevated amylase and lipase confirm the pancreatitis diagnosis, they are not direct indicators of complications. Morphine administration addresses pain management but does not reflect a complication. Pantoprazole helps reduce gastric acid secretion but is preventative, not indicative of a current complication. A temperature of 38.5 is elevated, but the more concerning finding is the elevated WBC which points to possible infection, a complication.",

B: He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A: At 07:00, the patient reports increased abdominal pain rated 8/10. His vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. I&O: minimal urine output since admission. Labs show elevated amylase and lipase. R: I am concerned about possible hypovolemic shock and potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). I recommend STAT CBC, CMP, ABG, and increase IV fluids. Consider a chest X-ray.",
