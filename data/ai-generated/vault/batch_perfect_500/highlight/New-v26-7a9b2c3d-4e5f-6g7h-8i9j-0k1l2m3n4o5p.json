Surgery was uncomplicated. Received morphine for pain control post-op. Last voided at 04:00 this morning. \nA: At 07:30, patient's BP is 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on room air. Skin is cool and clammy. Urine output since 04:00 is 30 mL. Dressing is dry and intact. Patient is increasingly lethargic. Pain level is reported as 2/10 at the surgical site. \nR: I am concerned about hypovolemic shock secondary to possible internal bleeding or inadequate fluid replacement. I recommend STAT CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, and a fluid bolus of 500 mL Normal Saline. Please also assess surgical site for any signs of excessive bleeding. Monitor vital signs every 5 minutes until stable.",
