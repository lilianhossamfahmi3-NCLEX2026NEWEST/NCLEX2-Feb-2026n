        "correct": "A decreased respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute in a COPD patient receiving oxygen suggests potential oxygen-induced hypoventilation. COPD patients rely on chronic hypoxia to stimulate breathing (hypoxic drive). Excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to respiratory depression and CO2 retention (hypercapnia). Immediate intervention is needed to prevent respiratory arrest. The target SpO2 for COPD patients is generally 88-92%.",
        "mnemonic": "Low RR on O2 = Respiratory Risk in COPD",
        "incorrect": "While a pulse oximetry reading of 92% is within the acceptable target range for COPD patients, it does not require immediate intervention. A slight increase in dyspnea from baseline is expected during an exacerbation, but it does not indicate an immediate life-threatening situation. Clear lung sounds bilaterally are a positive finding and do not require immediate intervention.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking that a pulse ox of 92% is bad, but it is actually the target range for COPD patients. The key is recognizing the dangerously low respiratory rate.",
