    "correct": "A decreased respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute in a COPD patient receiving oxygen suggests potential oxygen-induced hypoventilation. COPD patients rely on hypoxia to stimulate breathing, and excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to respiratory depression and CO2 retention.",

    "incorrect": "While a pulse oximetry reading of 92% is acceptable for COPD patients, it does not require immediate intervention. A slight increase in dyspnea from baseline is expected during an exacerbation, but it does not indicate an immediate life-threatening situation. Clear lung sounds bilaterally are a positive finding and do not require immediate intervention.",
