The potassium level is also low, but the hypotension is the priority because it directly impacts tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. Rapid intervention, such as fluid bolus or medication adjustment, may be necessary to stabilize the patient's condition and prevent further complications like shock or organ damage.",
