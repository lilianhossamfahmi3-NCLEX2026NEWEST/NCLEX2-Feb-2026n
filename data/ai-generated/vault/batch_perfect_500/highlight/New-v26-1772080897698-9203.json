        "correct": "The patient's oxygen saturation of 88% on 2L nasal cannula and PaO2 of 55 mmHg indicate severe hypoxemia requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. The use of accessory muscles, altered ABGs, and increasing lethargy point towards impending respiratory failure. Rapid intervention, such as increasing oxygen delivery or considering non-invasive ventilation, is crucial to prevent further deterioration. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and ABGs is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Addressing hypoxemia promptly can prevent complications such as respiratory arrest and organ damage.",

The priority is addressing the inadequate oxygenation. Focusing solely on these symptoms without addressing the hypoxemia can lead to a delay in necessary interventions. These findings should be monitored, but the immediate priority is to improve the patient's oxygenation status.",
