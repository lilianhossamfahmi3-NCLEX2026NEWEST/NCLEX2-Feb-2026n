        "correct": "The arterial blood gas (ABG) results showing a PaCO2 of 60 mmHg indicate acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, requiring immediate intervention to improve ventilation. This is the most life-threatening finding. Elevated PaCO2 indicates that the patient is not effectively eliminating carbon dioxide, leading to a buildup of acid in the blood. Hypoxemia further exacerbates the situation by reducing oxygen delivery to vital organs. Immediate interventions may include increasing oxygen delivery, assisting with ventilation (e.g., BiPAP), and administering bronchodilators to improve airflow.",

        "incorrect": "While tachycardia and elevated blood pressure are concerning, they are less immediately life-threatening than the ABG results indicating respiratory failure. Tachycardia is expected in COPD exacerbation as the body attempts to compensate for hypoxemia and increased work of breathing. The chest X-ray findings are consistent with COPD, but do not require immediate intervention compared to the critical ABG values. Accessory muscle use is an expected finding with COPD exacerbation but alone is not more concerning than the ABG values, which directly reflect the patient's respiratory status and acid-base balance.",
