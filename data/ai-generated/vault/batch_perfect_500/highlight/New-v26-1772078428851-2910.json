        "correct": "A blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg indicates hypotension, which is a critical finding in sepsis and requires immediate intervention such as further fluid resuscitation and potential vasopressor support to improve tissue perfusion and prevent organ damage. The patient's altered mental status further supports the need for immediate action.",

        "incorrect": "An SpO2 of 90% on 2L nasal cannula is low, but acceptable at the moment. The priority is addressing the low blood pressure to improve oxygen delivery. While supplemental oxygen is important, it is secondary to stabilizing blood pressure.",
