Elevated BUN can be related to dehydration or kidney injury, but does not definitively point to septic shock. Hypoxia can be present in pneumonia without the patient necessarily being in septic shock. Acetaminophen is used for fever management and does not directly contribute to the diagnosis of septic shock itself. The current antibiotic orders, though relevant to the patient's overall care, are not direct indicators of the presence of septic shock.",

R: The patient has developed a productive cough with purulent sputum, increased dyspnea, and altered mental status since 04:00 this morning. His blood pressure is trending downward. A: The patient is currently hypotensive with a blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg, a heart rate of 135 bpm, and a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C). His SpO2 is 89% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. He has new onset confusion and decreased urine output over the last 4 hours. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally in the lungs. B: The patient has a history of hypertension, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. He is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia. There is a DNR/DNI order in place for this patient. The patient's condition is concerning and warrants immediate attention due to the rapid deterioration and signs of potential septic shock. Close monitoring and further investigation are necessary.",
