    "correct": "A pH of 7.30 and a PaCO2 of 55 mmHg indicate respiratory acidosis, requiring immediate intervention to improve ventilation. A peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 35 cm H2O is elevated, suggesting increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance, such as from retained secretions, bronchospasm, or pulmonary edema. The respiratory rate of 28 (ventilator rate 14) indicates that the patient is breathing over the set ventilator rate, meaning that the ventilator settings are not adequately supporting the patient's respiratory needs. This can indicate anxiety, pain, or inadequate sedation.",

    "incorrect": "A heart rate of 110 is elevated but may be related to the client's post-operative status, pain, or anxiety. While it should be monitored, it is not the priority. A blood pressure of 160/90 is elevated, but needs to be addressed after the immediate respiratory compromise. The patient's temperature of 37.8°C is slightly elevated but does not require immediate intervention compared to the respiratory issues. An SpO2 of 92% is acceptable on mechanical ventilation with underlying COPD, although further optimization of ventilation might be needed. Coarse crackles bilaterally warrants intervention, but the other values indicate a greater urgency.",

Background: History of COPD and hypertension. He was extubated briefly this morning but exhibited increased work of breathing. Assessment: At 07:00, vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR 28 (ventilator rate 14), SpO2 92%, Temp 37.8°C. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. ET tube is secure at 22 cm at the lip. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O. Client is restless and appears uncomfortable. ABG results from 06:00: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 75, HCO3 24. Receiving continuous IV sedation with propofol per protocol. Recommendation: Please assess respiratory status and consider adjusting ventilator settings. Consider suctioning for increased secretions.",
