        "correct": "A potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L in the context of AKI and muscle weakness is a critical finding. Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and requires immediate intervention, such as administration of Kayexalate, calcium gluconate, or insulin and glucose. The rapid rise in potassium can overwhelm the kidneys' ability to excrete it, leading to dangerous cardiac effects.",

        "incorrect": "While elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and slight skin tenting are concerning, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hyperkalemia in a patient with AKI. The edema is likely related to fluid overload from AKI. These findings should be addressed, but hyperkalemia takes priority. Elevated blood pressure and increased respiratory rate suggest fluid overload and potential pulmonary edema, but hyperkalemia poses a more immediate threat to cardiac function. Skin tenting indicates dehydration, which is being addressed with IV fluids.",
