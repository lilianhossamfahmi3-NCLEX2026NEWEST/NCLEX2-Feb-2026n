        "correct": "A fetal heart rate of 100 bpm is indicative of fetal bradycardia, which can be a sign of fetal distress and requires immediate intervention to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent potential complications. Fetal bradycardia can be caused by several factors, including maternal hypotension, umbilical cord compression, or fetal hypoxia. Immediate interventions may include repositioning the mother, administering oxygen, and notifying the healthcare provider for further evaluation and potential interventions such as amnioinfusion or expedited delivery.",
        "incorrect": "While contractions every 2-3 minutes are frequent, they are expected in active labor and do not require immediate intervention unless they are tetanic or associated with non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. A maternal heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated but may be related to pain, anxiety, or dehydration during labor; it should be monitored but is not the priority. A respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min is slightly elevated but within acceptable limits for a laboring patient. A temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C) is slightly elevated but may be related to dehydration or epidural analgesia; it should be monitored, but the fetal heart rate is the priority.",
