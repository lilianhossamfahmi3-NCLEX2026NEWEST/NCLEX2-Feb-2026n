    "correct": "The patient's SpO2 of 88% indicates hypoxemia and requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. The ABGs also show respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2, low PaO2), confirming respiratory compromise.",

Increased heart rate and blood pressure can be expected with an infection and increased work of breathing. Elevated WBCs and temperature are indicators of infection, and the doctor is already treating with antibiotics. Coarse crackles and diminished breath sounds are typical findings in pneumonia, especially with consolidation, but do not warrant immediate intervention above the low SpO2.",
