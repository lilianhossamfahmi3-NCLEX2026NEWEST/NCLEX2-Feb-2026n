        "correct": "The patient's SpO2 of 88% indicates hypoxemia and requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. The ABGs also show respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2, low PaO2), confirming respiratory compromise. Immediate interventions include increasing oxygen delivery, assessing airway patency, and considering assisted ventilation if necessary. This prevents further respiratory decompensation and potential organ damage.",

        "incorrect": "While the other findings are concerning and require attention, they do not pose as immediate a threat to the patient's life as the low SpO2. Increased heart rate and blood pressure can be expected with an infection and increased work of breathing. Elevated WBCs and temperature are indicators of infection, and the doctor is already treating with antibiotics. Coarse crackles and diminished breath sounds are typical findings in pneumonia, especially with consolidation, but do not warrant immediate intervention above the low SpO2.",
