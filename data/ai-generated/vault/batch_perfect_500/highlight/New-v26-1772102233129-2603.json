Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, and decreased urine output suggests kidney dysfunction due to hypoperfusion. Immediate intervention is needed to prevent organ damage and death. Interventions may include fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to improve blood pressure and perfusion.",

These findings suggest a progression towards organ dysfunction and hemodynamic instability.",
