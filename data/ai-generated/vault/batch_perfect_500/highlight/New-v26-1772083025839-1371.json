        "correct": "Initiating intravenous fluid resuscitation is the priority in DKA to address dehydration and improve perfusion. The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate indicate significant fluid deficit, which needs immediate correction before other interventions can be fully effective. While insulin and electrolyte correction are crucial, they are secondary to restoring fluid volume and stabilizing hemodynamics. Rapid fluid replacement helps stabilize blood pressure and improves organ perfusion, setting the stage for other treatments to be effective. The initial bolus helps to expand intravascular volume quickly.",

        "incorrect": "Administering potassium chloride: While potassium replacement is often necessary in DKA, it should be done cautiously after assessing potassium levels and renal function. Rapid potassium administration can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in the presence of renal impairment. Also, the potassium order is already present in the MAR. The priority is to address the life-threatening hypovolemia first.\nAdministering a bolus of intravenous insulin: A bolus of insulin can cause a rapid drop in blood glucose and potentially lead to cerebral edema or severe hypokalemia. A continuous insulin infusion is preferred for gradual glucose control. Bolus insulin can exacerbate electrolyte imbalances.\nMonitoring blood glucose every 4 hours: While monitoring blood glucose is important, it needs to be done more frequently (e.g., every hour) during the initial stages of DKA treatment to assess the effectiveness of insulin therapy and prevent hypoglycemia. The current context points to immediate, not delayed action. Frequent monitoring is essential, but not the immediate priority.",
