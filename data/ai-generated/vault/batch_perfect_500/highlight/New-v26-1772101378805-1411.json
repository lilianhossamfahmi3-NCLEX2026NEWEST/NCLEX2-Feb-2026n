        "correct": "Hypotension (blood pressure 88/50 mmHg) indicates inadequate tissue perfusion due to vasodilation and decreased cardiac output, characteristic of septic shock. Reduced urine output (20 mL/hr) suggests impaired renal perfusion and potential kidney damage, further compromising the patient's condition. Immediate intervention is crucial to restore blood pressure and improve renal function to prevent irreversible organ damage and death. These findings reflect a critical deterioration in the patient's hemodynamic status, necessitating urgent medical attention, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.",
        "mnemonic": "Think 'STOP Sepsis': Seek source, Take vitals, Oxygenate, Perfusion (BP), Send labs, Initiate antibiotics.",
        "incorrect": "While elevated temperature (101.5°F or 38.6°C), increased heart rate (110 bpm), and elevated white blood cell count (15,000/µL) are indicative of sepsis, hypotension and decreased urine output are more critical and require immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. The question asks for findings requiring IMMEDIATE intervention, making hypotension and decreased urine output the priority.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may focus on the elevated temperature or heart rate, which are common signs of infection, but the question asks for findings requiring IMMEDIATE intervention, making hypotension and decreased urine output the priority. Overlooking the significance of low blood pressure and urine output can lead to delayed treatment and adverse patient outcomes.",
