        "correct": "A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and arrest. In AKI, the kidneys' ability to excrete potassium is impaired, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream. This increased extracellular potassium depolarizes the cell membranes, affecting cardiac conduction and muscle function. Immediate intervention, such as administering calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), is required to stabilize the cardiac membrane and lower the potassium level. ECG monitoring is crucial to detect early signs of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves or widened QRS complexes.",
        "mnemonic": "Think 'kidneys excrete potassium'. If kidneys aren't working, potassium builds up.",
        "incorrect": "A creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL is elevated but expected in AKI due to reduced glomerular filtration rate. While it needs monitoring to track kidney function, it's not the immediate priority. BUN of 45 mg/dL is also elevated in AKI due to the kidneys' inability to excrete urea. Monitoring is necessary, but it's not as critical as addressing hyperkalemia. Urine output of 20 mL/hr indicates oliguria, a common finding in AKI, reflecting decreased kidney perfusion and function. While monitoring fluid balance is important, it's secondary to the immediate threat of hyperkalemia.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into focusing on the renal labs, but the potassium level is the most life-threatening and requires immediate action to prevent cardiac complications.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Hyperkalemia is a common and dangerous complication of AKI, often requiring emergent treatment.",
            "ECG changes are often the first sign of hyperkalemia and should be promptly assessed.",
            "Treatment for hyperkalemia aims to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, and remove potassium from the body."
