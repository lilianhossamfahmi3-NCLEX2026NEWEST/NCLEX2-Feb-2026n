        "correct": "Hypotension (blood pressure 88/50 mmHg) and decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) are critical indicators of septic shock, suggesting inadequate tissue perfusion. Immediate intervention is required to prevent organ damage and death. These findings indicate the patient is not responding adequately to the initial stages of sepsis and requires aggressive management.",
        "incorrect": "While a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F) and a heart rate of 110 bpm are elevated and concerning, they are less immediately life-threatening than hypotension and oliguria in the context of sepsis. These findings are expected in sepsis but do not represent the same level of immediate threat. An oxygen saturation of 94% is acceptable and does not require immediate intervention, although continued monitoring is necessary.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Early recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Hypotension and oliguria are late signs of sepsis and require immediate action.",
            "Monitor vital signs and urine output closely in patients at risk for sepsis. A decreasing blood pressure and urine output despite initial interventions are red flags.",

        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into selecting elevated temperature or heart rate, which are common in sepsis but less critical than signs of end-organ damage. Test takers may focus on the fever and tachycardia, overlooking the more critical signs of hypotension and oliguria.",
