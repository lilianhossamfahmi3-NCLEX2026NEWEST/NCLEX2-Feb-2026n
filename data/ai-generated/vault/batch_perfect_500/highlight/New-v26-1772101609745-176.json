        "correct": "Decreased fetal movement can indicate fetal compromise such as placental insufficiency or fetal hypoxia. The nurse should immediately assess fetal heart rate and activity via a non-stress test (NST) to determine fetal well-being. An NST monitors the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movements. Reactive NST (two accelerations of FHR in 20 minutes) indicates fetal well-being. Non-reactive NST requires further evaluation.",
        "incorrect": "While reassuring the client is important for therapeutic communication, it does not address the potential for fetal compromise. Assessing fetal heart rate is the priority to determine fetal well-being. Inducing labor is premature without first assessing fetal well-being and determining the cause of decreased fetal movement. Documenting the finding is important for legal reasons, but is not the priority action.",
