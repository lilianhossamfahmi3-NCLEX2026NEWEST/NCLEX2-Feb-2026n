        "correct": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning the fetus is not receiving enough oxygen. This requires immediate intervention to improve fetal oxygenation. Actions include repositioning the mother (often to the left side), administering oxygen via face mask, increasing intravenous fluids, and notifying the healthcare provider. These interventions aim to maximize blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus to prevent fetal distress and potential complications.\n\nclinicalPearl: Late decelerations consistently occurring after the peak of a contraction indicate a compromised fetal oxygen supply. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial for a positive outcome.\n\nquestionTrap: Students might focus on other parameters like normal fetal heart rate or clear amniotic fluid, but the late decelerations are the most critical and require immediate action. Ignoring this can lead to fetal hypoxia.\n\nmnemonic: VEAL CHOP: Variable decelerations - Cord compression; Early decelerations - Head compression; Acceleration - Okay; Late decelerations - Placental insufficiency",
        "incorrect": "A fetal heart rate of 140 bpm is within the normal range (110-160 bpm) and does not require immediate intervention. Clear amniotic fluid is a normal finding, indicating the absence of meconium, which would be a concern. A contraction duration of 60 seconds is within the expected range for active labor and is not indicative of a problem.",
