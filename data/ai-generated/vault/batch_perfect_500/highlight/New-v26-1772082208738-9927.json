    "correct": "Administering desmopressin (DDAVP) as prescribed is the most important intervention. DDAVP is a synthetic vasopressin analog that replaces the missing antidiuretic hormone (ADH), reducing urine output and relieving polydipsia. This directly addresses the underlying cause of Diabetes Insipidus.",

    "incorrect": "Encouraging fluid intake is important, but does not address the underlying ADH deficiency. It only temporarily alleviates thirst and may not prevent dehydration, especially with continued excessive urine output. Monitoring urine output is important for evaluation but does not treat the condition. Providing education on sodium restriction is not indicated for Diabetes Insipidus. It is more relevant for SIADH or hypernatremia from other causes.",
