Ms. Jones is experiencing increased muscle weakness, particularly in her face and throat, leading to difficulty swallowing and speaking. She denies fever or recent illness. Her vital signs are stable. She takes Metformin and Lisinopril daily. The patient is alert and oriented but anxious about her new diagnosis and increasing weakness. We initiated pyridostigmine, but it's too early to assess effectiveness. Please advise on priority nursing interventions. Her grip strength is notably diminished bilaterally. She is able to ambulate with assistance, but reports significant fatigue with minimal exertion.",
