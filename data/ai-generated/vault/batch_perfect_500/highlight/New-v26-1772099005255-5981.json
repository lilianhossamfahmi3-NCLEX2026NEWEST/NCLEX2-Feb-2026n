        "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering stool softeners prevents straining during bowel movements, which can increase ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes in ICP, enabling timely intervention. Spacing nursing activities reduces stimulation and prevents sudden increases in ICP. These interventions collectively aim to minimize factors that exacerbate ICP and support cerebral perfusion.\n\nClinical Pearl: Elevating the head of the bed is a cornerstone intervention for managing increased ICP, facilitating venous outflow and reducing cerebral edema.\n\nMnemonic: ELEVATE - Elevate head, Limit stimulation, Evaluate neuro status, Venous drainage, Avoid straining, Time activities.",

        "incorrect": "Clustering nursing activities can increase ICP due to increased stimulation and metabolic demand. Encouraging coughing can increase ICP due to increased intrathoracic pressure, impeding venous return from the brain. Placing the client in a Trendelenburg position increases blood flow to the brain, which can exacerbate ICP by increasing cerebral blood volume.\n\nQuestion Trap: The question requires the nurse to differentiate between interventions that directly mitigate increased ICP and those that could potentially worsen the condition.
