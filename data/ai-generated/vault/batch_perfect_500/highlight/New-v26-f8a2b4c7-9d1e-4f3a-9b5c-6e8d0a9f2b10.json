    "correct": "Septic shock is characterized by hypotension (BP 90/50 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 122 bpm), tachypnea (RR 28 breaths/min), fever (102.5°F/39.2°C), elevated white blood cell count (18,000/µL), and elevated lactate levels (4.0 mmol/L). Reduced urine output (20 mL/hr) indicates impaired renal perfusion, a key sign of hypoperfusion in septic shock. These findings, combined with the patient's recent hospitalization for pneumonia and current antibiotic regimen, strongly suggest septic shock. The patient's Penicillin allergy is also important to note, as it restricts antibiotic choices and highlights the need for careful medication management.",

    "incorrect": "While elevated creatinine and BUN may indicate renal impairment, they are not specific indicators of septic shock and can be elevated in other conditions such as dehydration or chronic kidney disease. The patient's current medications (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Acetaminophen) are treatments for the underlying pneumonia and fever and do not directly indicate the presence of septic shock. Pending blood cultures are relevant for identifying the causative organism but do not, in themselves, confirm the presence of septic shock. The patient's oxygen administration (2L NC) is a supportive measure, not a diagnostic criterion for septic shock. Hemoglobin and platelet levels are within normal limits and do not directly contribute to the diagnosis of septic shock.",

He is currently being treated with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. At 0700 this morning, the patient was stable and resting comfortably. However, at 1400, the patient was noted to be increasingly confused and restless. His blood pressure has dropped significantly from 130/80 mmHg to 90/50 mmHg. His heart rate has increased from 88 bpm to 122 bpm. The patient's temperature is now 102.5°F (39.2°C). Respiratory rate is 28 and labored. Oxygen saturation is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. The WBC count is elevated at 18,000/µL. Lactate level is 4.0 mmol/L. Blood cultures have been drawn and sent to the lab for analysis. I have already notified the physician of these changes and am awaiting further orders. Please note the Penicillin allergy when reviewing medication orders.",
