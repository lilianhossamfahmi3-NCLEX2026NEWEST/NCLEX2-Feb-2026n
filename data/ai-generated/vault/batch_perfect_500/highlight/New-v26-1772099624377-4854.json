These findings suggest the patient is not perfusing adequately and is in a state of shock. The body's response to infection leads to systemic inflammation, causing vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, resulting in hypotension. The heart rate and respiratory rate increase to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery. Elevated WBC and lactate levels confirm the presence of infection and tissue hypoxia.",

        "incorrect": "While an elevated temperature, elevated WBC, and elevated lactate are concerning, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. These findings, in conjunction with the other vital signs, indicate a critical situation requiring immediate action. Focusing solely on individual lab values without considering the overall clinical picture can lead to delayed intervention.",
