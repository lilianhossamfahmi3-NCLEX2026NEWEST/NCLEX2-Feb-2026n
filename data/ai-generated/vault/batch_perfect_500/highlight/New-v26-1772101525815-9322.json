These findings suggest the patient is not adequately perfusing vital organs.",
        "incorrect": "While a temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and a heart rate of 110 bpm are common signs of infection and inflammation, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension and decreased urine output in the context of suspected sepsis. Altered mental status (confusion) is concerning but less immediately critical than hemodynamic instability. The body is trying to compensate for the infection, but the blood pressure and urine output indicate decompensation.",
