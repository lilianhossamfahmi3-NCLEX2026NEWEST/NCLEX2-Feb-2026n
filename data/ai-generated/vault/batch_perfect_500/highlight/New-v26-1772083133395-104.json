        "correct": "The patient's PaCO2 of 60 mmHg indicates acute respiratory acidosis and requires immediate intervention to improve ventilation. Elevated PaCO2 levels in COPD patients can lead to severe respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure. Immediate interventions may include increasing oxygen support, administering bronchodilators, and considering non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to improve gas exchange and reduce the PaCO2.",

        },
        "incorrect": "While elevated, the WBC count of 12,000/mm3 is consistent with an inflammatory response related to the COPD exacerbation, but does not require immediate intervention as respiratory compromise takes precedence. The heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated, but is expected with the exacerbation and treatment, and isn't the priority. While important to address, a pain level of 2/10 is lower priority than the patient's respiratory distress.",
