        "correct": "Refrain from performing a vaginal examination. Painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester is a classic sign of placenta previa. Performing a vaginal examination could disrupt the placenta and cause severe hemorrhage.\n\nclinicalPearl: Painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester is highly suggestive of placenta previa. Vaginal exams are contraindicated in patients with suspected placenta previa until placental location is confirmed via ultrasound. Placenta previa can lead to significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.",

        "incorrect": "Assess the patient's pain level. The patient reports painless bleeding. While pain assessment is important in general, it is not the priority in this situation where painless bleeding suggests placenta previa.\n\nquestionTrap: Students may focus on general assessment measures or preparing for delivery without understanding the potential danger of a vaginal exam in the presence of placenta previa. A common mistake is failing to recognize the significance of painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester and prioritizing other interventions.",

        "pathophysiology": "Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment, partially or completely covering the cervical os. During the third trimester, the lower uterine segment thins and contracts, which can disrupt placental vessels and cause painless bleeding. Vaginal examination can further disrupt the placenta, leading to severe hemorrhage."

Her prenatal care has been unremarkable, and she has had no previous episodes of bleeding during this pregnancy.\nA: On initial assessment at 08:15, the patient is alert and oriented.
