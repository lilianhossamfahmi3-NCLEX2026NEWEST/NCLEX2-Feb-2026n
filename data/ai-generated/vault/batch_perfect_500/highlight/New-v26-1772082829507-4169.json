        "correct": "A blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg indicates severe hypertension and requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as stroke, placental abruption, or eclampsia. This BP reading meets the threshold for treatment per the MAR, necessitating urgent action to lower the blood pressure and prevent further maternal and fetal compromise. The goal is to maintain BP within a safe range to optimize perfusion and prevent end-organ damage.",
