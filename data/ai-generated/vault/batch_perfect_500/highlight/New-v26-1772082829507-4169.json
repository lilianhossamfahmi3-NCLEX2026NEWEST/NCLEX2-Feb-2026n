    "correct": "A blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg indicates severe hypertension and requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as stroke, placental abruption, or eclampsia. This BP reading is meeting the threshold for treatment per the MAR.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "BP_SEVERE": "BP > 160/110 = Brain Perfusion SEVERELY compromised. Requires immediate action!"
