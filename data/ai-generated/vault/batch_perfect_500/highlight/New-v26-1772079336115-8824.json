        "correct": "Massage the fundus. A boggy fundus is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contractions, which helps to compress the blood vessels and reduce bleeding. This action directly addresses uterine atony, the primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Continuous assessment of the fundus and lochia is crucial in the immediate postpartum period to prevent complications.",
