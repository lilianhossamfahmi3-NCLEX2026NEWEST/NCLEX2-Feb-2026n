Assessment: At 07:30, her contractions are every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. Vital signs: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 20, Temp 98.8°F (37.1°C). Fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline is 140 bpm with moderate variability. Late decelerations are noted.

        "correct": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning the fetus is not receiving enough oxygen. Immediate interventions are required to improve fetal oxygenation, such as repositioning the mother to her left side, administering oxygen via face mask, increasing intravenous fluids, and notifying the healthcare provider. These actions aim to maximize blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus.",
        "incorrect": "A fetal heart rate of 140 bpm is within the normal range of 110-160 bpm, indicating fetal well-being. Moderate variability in the fetal heart rate is a reassuring sign of a healthy fetal nervous system. Contractions every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds, are expected findings in the active phase of labor.",
