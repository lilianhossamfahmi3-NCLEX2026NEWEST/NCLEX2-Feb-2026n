        "correct": "A decreased respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute in a COPD patient receiving oxygen suggests potential oxygen-induced hypoventilation. COPD patients rely on hypoxia to stimulate breathing, and excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to respiratory depression and CO2 retention. The ABG values (pH 7.30, PaCO2 60 mmHg) support this, indicating respiratory acidosis. Immediate intervention is needed to prevent respiratory failure. The elevated WBC count (12,000/mm3) suggests a possible infection contributing to the exacerbation.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry reading of 92% is within the acceptable range for COPD patients on oxygen therapy, although it should be monitored. The target SpO2 for COPD patients is typically 88-92%. While not immediately life-threatening, it warrants continued assessment.\n\nClear breath sounds bilaterally are a positive finding, but in the context of the patient's overall condition (low respiratory rate, elevated PaCO2), they do not negate the need for intervention. The patient's respiratory rate is more concerning.\n\nPink, dry oral mucosa indicates adequate hydration, which is a positive finding. However, it does not address the primary concern of respiratory depression.",
