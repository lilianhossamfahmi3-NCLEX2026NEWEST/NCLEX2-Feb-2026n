A: Continue oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 between 88-92%. Administer scheduled bronchodilators. Monitor respiratory status closely, including ABGs if needed. Consider chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. R: Please evaluate patient for possible initiation of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics.

The ABG values (pH 7.32, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 30 mEq/L) indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia, which is a critical finding in a COPD patient. This requires immediate intervention to improve ventilation and oxygenation.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry reading of 92% is within the acceptable range for patients with COPD, who often have chronically lower oxygen saturation levels. While a SpO2 of 90% on 2L NC is below the target range, it does not represent the most immediate threat to the patient's well-being compared to a severely depressed respiratory rate or critical ABG values. Complaints of mild dyspnea are expected in a COPD exacerbation but do not indicate the need for immediate intervention unless accompanied by other critical findings. Clear breath sounds bilaterally, while generally a positive finding, do not negate the need for intervention if other parameters are compromised. In this case, the severely depressed respiratory rate and critical ABG values take precedence.",
