            "correct": "A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The elevated potassium affects the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them hyperexcitable and prone to dysrhythmias. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, and enhance potassium elimination from the body. This may include administering calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, and potentially dialysis.",
            "mnemonic": "Think 'K' for Potassium and 'K' for Cardiac Arrest when prioritizing interventions in AKI.",
            "incorrect": "A urine output of 30 mL/hr is within the acceptable range for kidney function, but it should be monitored closely as it can indicate worsening AKI. However, it does not require immediate intervention compared to hyperkalemia.\n\nWhile a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is elevated, it is not immediately life-threatening in the context of AKI. Addressing hyperkalemia takes precedence.\n\nMild nausea is a common symptom in AKI due to the accumulation of uremic toxins, but it is not the priority compared to the risk of cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia.",
            "questionTrap": "The other options may seem concerning, but hyperkalemia poses the most immediate threat to the patient's life due to the risk of cardiac arrest. Always prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and address life-threatening conditions first.",
