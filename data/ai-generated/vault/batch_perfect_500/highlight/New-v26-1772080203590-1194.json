        "correct": "A fetal heart rate (FHR) of 110 bpm is below the normal range of 110-160 bpm, indicating potential fetal distress. Bradycardia can result from fetal hypoxia, maternal hypotension, or umbilical cord compression. Immediate intervention is required to assess fetal well-being, determine the underlying cause of the bradycardia, and implement appropriate measures to improve fetal oxygenation and prevent further complications.",
