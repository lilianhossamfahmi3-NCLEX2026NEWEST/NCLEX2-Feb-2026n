  "rationale": {
    "correct": "A respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute indicates hypoventilation and potential respiratory failure, requiring immediate intervention such as reducing or temporarily discontinuing oxygen and providing ventilatory support if needed. High oxygen concentrations in COPD patients can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort.",
    "mnemonic": "ABC - Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Always prioritize breathing issues.",
    "incorrect": "While a pulse oximetry of 92% is acceptable for COPD patients, it does not require immediate intervention. A slight increase in confusion is concerning but less urgent than a severely depressed respiratory rate. Mild cyanosis around the lips is concerning but less urgent than a respiratory rate of 8.",
    "questionTrap": "The question trap is to focus on the acceptable SpO2 for COPD patients and overlook the dangerously low respiratory rate.",
