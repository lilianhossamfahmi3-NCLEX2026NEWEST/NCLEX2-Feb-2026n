    "correct": "The findings that require immediate notification of the healthcare provider are: SpO2 88% on room air, BP 90/60 mmHg, and Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. The SpO2 of 88% indicates significant hypoxemia, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary complications of pancreatitis. A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg indicates hypotension, suggesting possible hypovolemic shock due to third spacing of fluids and decreased perfusion. The decreased urine output of 20 mL/hr indicates potential renal hypoperfusion or failure secondary to hypovolemia and requires immediate intervention.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Elevated amylase and lipase levels are expected findings in acute pancreatitis, though they confirm the diagnosis, they don't necessitate immediate notification unless drastically changing. While abdominal distention and tenderness are concerning, they are expected findings; the *change* in condition is more important. Elevated WBC is also expected with inflammation and infection but doesn't require *immediate* notification in this scenario. Increased respiratory rate could be a compensatory mechanism, but the low SpO2 is more concerning. Elevated Hematocrit is likely due to hemoconcentration from dehydration, however, the low BP and SpO2 are greater priorities.",

      "trap": "The test-taker may focus on the elevated amylase, lipase, and WBC as indicators of pancreatitis and inflammation, overlooking the critical signs of hypoxemia, hypotension, and decreased urine output that represent immediate threats to the patient's well-being.",

    "sbar": "S: John Smith is a 58-year-old male admitted three days ago with acute pancreatitis. He reports abdominal pain as 8/10. B: The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, contributing to his current condition. A: He is currently receiving IV fluids and pain medication. This morning's 06:00 assessment revealed a distended and tender abdomen upon palpation. The patient is also reporting increased shortness of breath. His vital signs at 06:00 are as follows: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 32, SpO2 88% on room air, and Temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr for the past two hours. Recent lab results from 06:15 show: Amylase 1500 U/L, Lipase 2000 U/L, WBC 18,000/mm3, Hematocrit 55%, and Platelets 100,000/mm3. P: I am requesting an urgent evaluation for possible complications, including potential transfer to the ICU. I recommend considering fluid resuscitation and respiratory support given the patient's current status.",
