Elevated blood pressure and heart rate are compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. Crackles indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs due to increased pulmonary capillary pressure. Edema and JVD are signs of increased venous hydrostatic pressure, leading to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space.",

While elevated BUN and creatinine levels can sometimes be associated with fluid overload due to impaired renal function, they are not direct indicators without further context. Albumin is slightly decreased. This can be related to fluid overload but on its own, it is not an indicator.",
