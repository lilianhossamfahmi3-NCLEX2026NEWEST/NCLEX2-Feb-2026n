        "correct": "A blood pressure of 90/58 mmHg indicates hypotension, a critical sign of septic shock, necessitating immediate intervention to improve perfusion. Hypotension compromises oxygen delivery to vital organs, potentially leading to organ damage and failure. Immediate actions include fluid resuscitation to increase intravascular volume and, if fluids are insufficient, vasopressors to constrict blood vessels and elevate blood pressure. Monitoring the patient's response to these interventions is crucial to prevent further complications.\n\nclinicalPearl: Hypotension in sepsis is a late sign of decompensation, requiring rapid and aggressive management to prevent irreversible organ damage.",

        "incorrect": "A temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C) indicates fever, which is expected in sepsis as part of the body's inflammatory response. While fever contributes to increased metabolic demands, hypotension poses a more immediate threat to organ perfusion. Addressing the fever is important but secondary to stabilizing blood pressure.\n\nA respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute indicates tachypnea, a common compensatory mechanism in sepsis to increase oxygen delivery due to increased metabolic demands and potential hypoxemia. While respiratory support may be needed, hypotension requires more immediate attention to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.\n\nA white blood cell count of 18,000/μL indicates leukocytosis, consistent with an infection. Although it confirms the presence of an infection driving the sepsis, it does not require immediate intervention in the same way that hypotension does. The underlying infection needs to be treated with antibiotics, but restoring adequate blood pressure takes precedence.\n\nquestionTrap: Prioritization questions require the nurse to identify the most life-threatening finding and intervene accordingly. Hypotension is a more immediate threat to patient survival than fever, tachypnea, or leukocytosis.",
