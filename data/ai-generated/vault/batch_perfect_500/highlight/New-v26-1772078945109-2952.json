While fever needs to be addressed, the primary concern is the dangerously low blood pressure.\nRespiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute indicates tachypnea, which is common in sepsis due to increased metabolic demands. While respiratory support may be needed, hypotension is the more immediate priority.\nWhite blood cell count of 18,000/μL indicates leukocytosis, which is consistent with infection. However, it does not require immediate intervention in the same way that hypotension does. The underlying infection needs to be treated, but immediate action is needed to increase the BP first.",
