    "correct": "The critically low SpO2 of 68% indicates severe hypoxemia and requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. The elevated respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min signifies respiratory distress and increased work of breathing. The pH of 7.30 indicates acidosis, likely respiratory due to hypoventilation and increased CO2. The PaO2 of 50 mmHg confirms hypoxemia, necessitating immediate action to improve oxygen delivery to the tissues.",

    "incorrect": "While a heart rate of 180 bpm is elevated (tachycardia), it is expected during a 'tet spell' as the body attempts to compensate for hypoxemia. However, it is not the priority over severely decreased oxygen saturation. Hemoglobin of 18.5 g/dL and Hematocrit of 55% are elevated, indicating polycythemia, a common finding in children with cyanotic heart defects. These values are not an immediate threat. PaCO2 of 55 mmHg is elevated, indicating hypercapnia, but addressing oxygenation and ventilation is the priority. Although the infant is diaphoretic and retracting, these are symptoms of respiratory distress, it is the measurable vitals and lab values that will provide the most immediate data.",

    "sbar": "Situation: Ethan Miller, a 6-month-old male with Tetralogy of Fallot, is experiencing a 'tet spell'. Background: Admitted at 07:00 for elective surgical repair. He was stable until 13:30 when he became acutely cyanotic and agitated. Assessment: At 13:45, his SpO2 is 68%, heart rate 180 bpm, respiratory rate 60 breaths/min, and he is grunting. He is diaphoretic and retracting. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. Current medications include morphine sulfate PRN for pain and oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. Mother is at bedside, visibly distressed. Recommendation: Please assess immediately and prepare for interventions to manage the hypercyanotic spell. Consider increasing oxygen, administering morphine, and positioning the infant in knee-chest position. Prepare for possible intubation if condition worsens. Need immediate orders at 13:50.",
