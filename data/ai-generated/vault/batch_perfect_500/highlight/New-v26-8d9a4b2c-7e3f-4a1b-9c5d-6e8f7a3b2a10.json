    "correct": "The patient's vital signs at 07:30 indicate hypotension (88/52 mmHg) and tachycardia (122 bpm), which are classic signs of hypovolemic shock. The increased respiratory rate (28) reflects the body's attempt to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery. A low CVP (2 mmHg) also supports hypovolemia. The decreased urine output (15 mL/hr) suggests reduced renal perfusion due to decreased circulating volume. The hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL indicates significant blood loss, contributing to the hypovolemia. Lactate of 3.5 mmol/L indicates anaerobic metabolism due to poor perfusion.",

    "incorrect": "Although the patient received morphine, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the hypotension. The patient did receive fluids, so fluid replacement is not the finding contributing to hypovolemic shock. The BUN and Creatinine are elevated but do not directly contribute to the acute hypovolemic state but are more likely related to the patient's dehydration. Although the patient is post-op, the post-operative status itself is not a direct indicator of hypovolemic shock. Electrolytes, platelets and cefazolin administration have no bearing on the patient exhibiting signs of hypovolemic shock.",

B: History includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and recent colon cancer resection. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively due to blood loss. A: At 07:30, the patient's blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg, heart rate is 122 bpm, respirations are 28 and shallow, and SpO2 is 91% on 2L nasal cannula. He is pale, diaphoretic, and reports increased thirst. Urine output from the foley catheter is 15 mL/hr. His surgical dressing has a moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage. CVP is 2 mmHg. I have already increased the IV fluid rate to 200 mL/hr per protocol. R: I recommend immediate evaluation for possible hypovolemic shock and further orders.",
