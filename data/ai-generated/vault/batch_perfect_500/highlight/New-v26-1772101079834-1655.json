        "correct": "A fetal heart rate of 110 bpm indicates fetal bradycardia, which can be a sign of fetal distress and requires immediate intervention to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent potential complications. Fetal bradycardia can be caused by several factors, including maternal hypotension, umbilical cord compression, or fetal hypoxia. Immediate interventions may include repositioning the mother, administering oxygen, and notifying the healthcare provider for further evaluation and potential interventions such as amnioinfusion or expedited delivery. Continuous fetal monitoring is essential to assess the fetal response to interventions.",
        "incorrect": "While contractions every 2-3 minutes are frequent, they are expected in active labor and do not require immediate intervention unless they are tetanic or associated with non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. The client's blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg is slightly elevated but not critically high at this stage of labor; however, it should be monitored. A temperature of 37.2°C (99.0°F) is slightly elevated but not indicative of immediate infection or sepsis; it should be monitored, and further assessment should be performed to rule out infection.",
