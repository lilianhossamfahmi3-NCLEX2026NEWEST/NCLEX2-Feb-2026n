        "correct": "Elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial damage, suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Hypotension (90/60 mmHg) indicates inadequate perfusion to vital organs, potentially leading to shock. Tachycardia (HR 110 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the setting of decreased stroke volume. Oxygen saturation of 92% on 2L via nasal cannula indicates hypoxemia, requiring intervention to improve oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rapid identification and management of these critical findings are essential to prevent further myocardial damage and improve patient outcomes.",
