        "correct": "Massage the fundus. A boggy fundus is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage and should be addressed immediately with fundal massage to promote uterine contraction and reduce bleeding. Fundal massage stimulates the uterine muscles to contract, which helps to compress the blood vessels and reduce blood flow.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Administer oxygen. While oxygen may be considered if the client shows signs of hypovolemia, addressing the source of the bleeding (uterine atony) is the priority. Oxygen administration does not directly address the cause of the hemorrhage.\n\nIncrease the oxytocin infusion rate. The client is already receiving oxytocin. While increasing the rate might be considered if the fundus does not respond to massage, the priority is physical intervention first. Increasing oxytocin without addressing the atony may not be effective.\n\nNotify the healthcare provider. While the healthcare provider should be notified if the bleeding does not subside after interventions, the nurse's initial action should be to address the boggy fundus directly. Delaying immediate intervention can lead to increased blood loss and potential complications.",
