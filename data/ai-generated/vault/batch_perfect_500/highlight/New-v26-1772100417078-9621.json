A: Currently, he is receiving oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. His oxygen saturation is 92%. Respiratory rate is 8 breaths per minute and shallow. He appears drowsy. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with some wheezing. C: I am concerned about possible oxygen-induced hypoventilation and potential respiratory failure. I recommend immediate assessment by the provider and possible reduction in oxygen flow rate and possible BiPAP initiation.",

        "correct": "A decreased respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute in a COPD patient receiving oxygen suggests potential oxygen-induced hypoventilation. COPD patients rely on hypoxia to stimulate breathing, and excessive oxygen can diminish this drive, leading to respiratory depression and CO2 retention. The ABG values (pH 7.30, PaCO2 60 mmHg) further support this, indicating respiratory acidosis.",
        "incorrect": "While a pulse oximetry reading of 92% is acceptable for COPD patients, it does not require immediate intervention as it is within the target range. A slight increase in dyspnea from baseline is expected during an exacerbation, but it does not indicate an immediate life-threatening condition on its own. Clear lung sounds bilaterally are a positive finding and do not require intervention.",
