    "correct": "The selected findings include: 'BP 120/78', 'HR 90', and 'RR 20'. These vital signs show improvement. The blood pressure is normalizing, the heart rate is decreasing, and the respiratory rate is decreasing, indicating a reduction in the body's compensatory mechanisms to combat the hyperosmolar state. This is indicative of effective fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Selecting 'Glucose 650 mg/dL' is incorrect because while it is lower than the initial glucose of 980 mg/dL, it is still significantly elevated and not within the normal range, indicating continued hyperglycemia. Selecting 'Mental Status Lethargic' is incorrect because the patient's mental status has only improved from 'Lethargic, Confused' to just 'Lethargic'. This demonstrates only slight improvement. Selecting 'Urine Output (03:00-07:00) 400 mL' is incorrect because the urine output of 400 mL over four hours may not be sufficient given the patient's hyperglycemic state. Adequate urine output is essential to eliminate excess glucose. The urine output should be closer to 0.5-1 mL/kg/hour to ensure adequate renal perfusion and glucose excretion.",

Blood glucose on arrival was 980 mg/dL. B: Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She lives alone and reportedly missed several doses of her oral hypoglycemic medications. A: Currently, the patient is receiving IV fluids (0.9% normal saline at 200 mL/hr) and an insulin infusion (5 units/hr). Vitals are monitored q1h. Urine output is being closely tracked via Foley catheter. Neuro checks are performed q2h. O: At 07:00, the patient's blood glucose is 650 mg/dL. Mental status remains unchanged. The current plan is to continue the insulin infusion and fluid resuscitation until the blood glucose reaches 200 mg/dL, then transition to subcutaneous insulin. The electrolyte panel is being monitored closely. We are awaiting the morning report from the night shift nurse. We are concerned about cerebral edema due to the rapid decrease in serum glucose.",
