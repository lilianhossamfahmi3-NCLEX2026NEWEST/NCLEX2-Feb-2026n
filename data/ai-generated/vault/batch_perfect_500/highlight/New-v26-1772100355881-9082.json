The nurse should prioritize assessing fetal heart rate and activity via a non-stress test (NST) to determine fetal well-being. An NST monitors the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movements. A reactive NST (normal) shows a normal baseline heart rate with accelerations, indicating adequate oxygenation and fetal well-being.",

Notifying the healthcare provider is important, but the nurse should first gather data to provide a more complete report. Instructing the client to drink a sugary beverage and monitor fetal movement might be a component of the assessment, but it delays a more comprehensive evaluation like an NST.",
