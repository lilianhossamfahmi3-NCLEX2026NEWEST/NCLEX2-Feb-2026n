        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 8 breaths/min in a COPD patient receiving oxygen is a critical finding indicating hypoventilation and potential respiratory failure. COPD patients are susceptible to oxygen-induced hypoventilation due to the suppression of their hypoxic drive. Immediate intervention is required, such as reducing or discontinuing oxygen and providing ventilatory support. The ABG values (pH 7.32 and PaCO2 58 mmHg) further support the presence of respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation.  clinicalPearl: Always assess respiratory rate and depth when administering oxygen to COPD patients. questionTrap: Test-takers may focus on the SpO2 of 92%, which seems acceptable, but the dangerously low respiratory rate is the priority. mnemonic: 'Rate Before Sat' – prioritize assessing respiratory rate before relying solely on oxygen saturation readings.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry reading of 92% is within the acceptable range for patients with COPD, who often have chronically elevated CO2 levels and rely on hypoxic drive for breathing. An oxygen saturation of 88-92% is generally considered acceptable. The ABG shows hypoxemia (PaO2 60 mmHg), but the respiratory rate is the more acute concern. Mild cyanosis of the nail beds may be an expected finding in COPD patients with chronic hypoxemia. While concerning, it is not the priority over a dangerously low respiratory rate. A productive cough with thick, yellow sputum is common in COPD exacerbations, and the elevated WBC (12,000/mm3) suggests an infection. Although it should be addressed with interventions like hydration and chest physiotherapy, it is not the priority over the immediate threat of respiratory failure indicated by the low respiratory rate.",
