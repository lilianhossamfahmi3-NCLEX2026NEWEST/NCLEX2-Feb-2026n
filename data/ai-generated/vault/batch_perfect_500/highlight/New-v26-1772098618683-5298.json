    "incorrect": "While a temperature of 101.5°F is elevated, it is not the priority finding. Acetaminophen is ordered to manage the fever. Red and swollen tonsils with white exudate are common findings in viral pharyngitis and do not require immediate intervention unless accompanied by respiratory distress. Decreased oral intake is concerning for dehydration, but stridor poses a more immediate threat to the patient's well-being.",
