These findings can compromise cardiac output and tissue perfusion, especially in a post-MI client. Immediate intervention is required to address these vital sign abnormalities. Bradycardia reduces the heart's ability to pump sufficient blood, while hypotension decreases the pressure needed to perfuse vital organs. The combination can lead to shock and further cardiac damage. Post-MI, maintaining adequate perfusion is critical to prevent complications and promote healing.",
        "incorrect": "While mild chest discomfort should be monitored, it is not the priority finding. The client rates it as 2/10, suggesting it is stable and tolerable. Potassium and Sodium levels are within normal limits. Trending down Troponin is a positive sign indicating the MI is resolving. A temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) is within normal limits. These findings, while important to note, do not pose the same immediate threat to the client's well-being as bradycardia and hypotension. Focusing solely on the chest pain could delay critical interventions needed to stabilize the client's cardiovascular status.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Bradycardia and hypotension post-MI can be caused by medications (e.g., beta-blockers), damage to the heart's electrical conduction system, or hypovolemia. Beta-blockers slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure, which can be beneficial but also lead to complications if not carefully monitored.",
            "Assess for signs and symptoms of decreased cardiac output, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and altered mental status. These symptoms indicate that the brain and other vital organs are not receiving enough oxygenated blood."

        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into focusing on the chest pain, which is present but stable. The critical findings are the bradycardia and hypotension. Test-takers may be inclined to address the chest pain first, overlooking the more immediate threats to the client's hemodynamic stability.",
