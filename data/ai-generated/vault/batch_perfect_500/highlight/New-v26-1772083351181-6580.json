        "correct": "Obtain a STAT non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out hemorrhage. This is the crucial first step to determine if the patient is eligible for thrombolytic therapy (tPA). Rapid identification of the stroke type (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic) is paramount because the treatment pathways diverge significantly. tPA, a potent thrombolytic agent, is indicated for ischemic stroke to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke, as it would exacerbate the bleeding and worsen the patient's condition.",

        "incorrect": "Prepare for immediate intubation. While airway management is always a consideration, the patient is currently maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Intubation is not indicated at this time unless there is further deterioration of respiratory status or level of consciousness. Addressing the airway is a secondary concern to determining the stroke type and potential for thrombolytic intervention.\nAdminister aspirin 325 mg PO. Aspirin is a standard treatment for ischemic stroke, but it is not the immediate priority. It is typically administered after a non-contrast CT scan has ruled out hemorrhage. Administering aspirin before knowing the stroke type could be detrimental if the patient is experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke.\nAdminister labetalol 20 mg IV to reduce blood pressure. While blood pressure management is important in stroke patients, it is not the immediate priority. Guidelines recommend carefully managing blood pressure, but the first step is to determine the stroke type. Rapidly lowering blood pressure without knowing the stroke type could worsen outcomes, especially in ischemic stroke.",

            "whyItIsWrong": "These interventions are important but secondary to ruling out hemorrhage, as they could be harmful in the presence of a hemorrhagic stroke. Prioritizing interventions without first determining the stroke type can lead to inappropriate and potentially harmful treatments.",
            "commonMistake": "Assuming that blood pressure management or aspirin administration is the immediate priority before determining the type of stroke. Many students focus on general stroke management principles without recognizing the critical importance of differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke before initiating treatment."
