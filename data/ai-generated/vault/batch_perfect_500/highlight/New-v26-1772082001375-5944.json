        "correct": "The elevated potassium level (5.8 mEq/L) poses the most immediate threat to the patient's well-being. Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, and requires prompt intervention to stabilize the patient and prevent adverse outcomes. Immediate interventions may include administering calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, insulin with glucose to shift potassium intracellularly, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body. ECG monitoring is crucial to detect cardiac changes associated with hyperkalemia.\n\nclinicalPearl: Hyperkalemia is a common complication of AKI due to the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium effectively. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent life-threatening cardiac complications.\nquestionTrap: Students may focus on other abnormal lab values or symptoms of AKI, such as low urine output or elevated creatinine, but fail to recognize the immediate danger of hyperkalemia.\nMnemonic: \"MURDER\" - Muscle weakness, Urine (oliguria/anuria), Respiratory distress, Decreased cardiac contractility, ECG changes, Reflexes (hyperreflexia or areflexia).",
