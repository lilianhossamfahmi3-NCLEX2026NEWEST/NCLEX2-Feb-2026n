In COPD patients, excessive oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to CO2 retention and respiratory acidosis.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry reading of 92% is within the acceptable range for patients with COPD, who often have chronically elevated PaCO2 levels and rely on hypoxic drive to breathe. A slight decrease in oxygen saturation is expected and acceptable. Increased work of breathing is a common finding in COPD patients, especially during exacerbations. While it should be monitored, it does not require immediate intervention unless it is severe or rapidly worsening. Mild wheezing is also a common finding in COPD patients and may be managed with bronchodilators. It does not require immediate intervention unless it is severe or accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress.",
