A slight decrease in oxygen saturation is expected and acceptable. Increased work of breathing is a common finding in COPD patients, especially during exacerbations. While it should be monitored, it does not require immediate intervention unless it is severe or rapidly worsening. Mild wheezing is also a common finding in COPD patients and may be managed with bronchodilators. It does not require immediate intervention unless it is severe or accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress.",
