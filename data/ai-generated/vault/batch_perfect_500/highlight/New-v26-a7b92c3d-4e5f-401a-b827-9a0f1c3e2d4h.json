    "correct": "Increased ICP in stroke patients can manifest as changes in level of consciousness (LOC), pupillary changes (sluggish or unequal), increasing blood pressure, decreased motor response, and vomiting. The decreasing GCS score from 14 to 11 is a significant indicator of declining LOC. The rise in BP to 210/125, HR to 105 and RR to 26 are all signs of increased ICP. A sluggish pupil indicates pressure on the oculomotor nerve, contributing to pupillary dysfunction.",

    "incorrect": "While an elevated temperature can occur with stroke, it is not a primary indicator of increased ICP. Normal saline infusion is a standard treatment and does not directly indicate increased ICP. Stable lab values are not indicative of increased ICP; they are within normal limits. Right-sided weakness is a symptom of the stroke itself, not necessarily indicative of increasing ICP, although worsening weakness, along with other symptoms, could suggest it.",

      "trap": "Students might focus on the stroke symptoms themselves rather than the specific signs of increased ICP. They also might misinterpret the interventions as indicators of increased ICP.",
      "howToOvercome": "Carefully differentiate between the symptoms of the stroke and the signs of increasing ICP. Focus on changes from baseline and interpret vital signs in context with neurological assessment findings. Pay close attention to trends and deviations from the patient's initial presentation."

    "sbar": "S: Michael Jones, a 72-year-old male, was admitted at 03:00 today due to an acute ischemic stroke affecting his right side. His last known well time was 22:00 last night. On admission, his NIHSS score was 14. B: Mr. Jones has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes lisinopril and atorvastatin. A: He is currently receiving IV alteplase as per stroke protocol, initiated at 03:30. We are performing neurological assessments every 30 minutes. His oxygen saturation is maintaining at 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. His blood pressure has been trending upwards since admission. R: At 05:00, the patient's condition changed significantly. He became increasingly restless and agitated. While his pupils were initially equal and reactive, the right pupil is now sluggishly reactive. He also experienced a new onset of vomiting and reports a headache. Given these changes, I am requesting an immediate evaluation to rule out increased intracranial pressure (ICP). We are concerned about potential complications related to the stroke and the possibility of cerebral edema. Further interventions may be necessary to manage his condition effectively.",
