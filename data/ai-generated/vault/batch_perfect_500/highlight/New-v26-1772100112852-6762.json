Troponin I is elevated at 0.8 ng/mL, and Creatine Kinase (CK) is elevated at 250 U/L. He is currently receiving routine post-MI medications as per MAR. I am concerned about his hypotension and potential for decreased cardiac output. I recommend assessing for signs of cardiogenic shock and considering interventions to improve blood pressure.",

While it warrants monitoring, hypotension is a more critical finding indicating potential cardiogenic shock or inadequate tissue perfusion.\nRespiratory rate of 24 breaths/min can be a compensatory mechanism for decreased oxygenation or pain, but it is less immediately life-threatening than hypotension in a post-MI client.\nA temperature of 99.1°F (37.3°C) is a low-grade fever and less concerning than hypotension in the immediate post-MI period. It should be monitored, but it is not the priority.",
