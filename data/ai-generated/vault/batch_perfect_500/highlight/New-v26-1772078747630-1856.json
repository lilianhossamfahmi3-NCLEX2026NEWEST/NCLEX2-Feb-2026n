        "correct": "The patient's oxygen saturation of 88% despite supplemental oxygen indicates severe respiratory compromise requiring immediate intervention. This could be due to worsening pulmonary edema related to fluid overload from CKD, and requires immediate intervention such as increasing oxygen delivery and potentially escalating care. The reduced oxygen saturation impairs tissue oxygenation, potentially leading to organ damage and failure if not promptly addressed.",

        "incorrect": "While a potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L is elevated and requires treatment, the respiratory compromise poses a more immediate threat to the patient's life. Addressing the hypoxemia is the priority. Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, but the immediate threat to airway and breathing takes precedence. The blood pressure of 170/98 is elevated, but not immediately life-threatening compared to the respiratory distress. While the glucose of 180 mg/dL needs to be addressed, it is less immediately life-threatening than the respiratory distress.",
