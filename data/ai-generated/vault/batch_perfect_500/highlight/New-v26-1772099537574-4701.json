        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 8 breaths/min indicates hypoventilation and potential respiratory failure, requiring immediate intervention such as reducing or discontinuing oxygen and supporting ventilation. COPD patients are at risk for hypercapnic respiratory failure, and a low respiratory rate can exacerbate this condition. The normal respiratory rate for an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute. A rate of 8 indicates significant respiratory depression.",
        "mnemonic": "ABC - Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Always prioritize breathing issues.",
        "incorrect": "A productive cough with thick, yellow sputum is common in COPD exacerbations and requires intervention such as encouraging coughing and deep breathing, but it is not the priority over hypoventilation. While concerning, it does not pose an immediate threat to the patient's life. Mild cyanosis of the nail beds indicates hypoxemia, but a respiratory rate of 8 is a more immediate threat. A pulse oximetry reading of 92% is acceptable for a COPD patient, as their target saturation is often lower than the general population (88-92%).",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking about the expected findings of COPD, rather than the most dangerous finding. Test takers may focus on the sputum production, which is common in COPD exacerbations, but the low respiratory rate is the priority.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "In COPD patients, high concentrations of oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive to breathe, leading to hypoventilation. Monitor respiratory rate and oxygen saturation closely in COPD patients receiving oxygen therapy.",
