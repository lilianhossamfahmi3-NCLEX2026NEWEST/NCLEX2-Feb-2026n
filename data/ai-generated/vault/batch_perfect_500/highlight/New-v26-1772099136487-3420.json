        "correct": "A temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) in a child receiving chemotherapy is a sign of neutropenic fever, a potentially life-threatening complication. Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia impairs the body's ability to fight infection, making even a mild fever a serious concern. Immediate intervention, including blood cultures and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, is required to prevent sepsis and other severe outcomes. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is likely very low, increasing the risk of rapid infection progression.",
        "mnemonic": "Fever in chemo = FAST action!",
        "incorrect": "While fatigue is a common side effect of chemotherapy due to anemia and metabolic changes, it does not require immediate intervention unless accompanied by other concerning symptoms such as severe weakness or altered mental status. Mild nausea and decreased appetite are also common side effects of chemotherapy, managed with antiemetics and nutritional support, respectively. These do not pose the same immediate threat as neutropenic fever.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking about common side effects of chemotherapy, rather than focusing on the most life-threatening complication. Recognizing the subtle but critical sign of fever in an immunocompromised child is key.",
