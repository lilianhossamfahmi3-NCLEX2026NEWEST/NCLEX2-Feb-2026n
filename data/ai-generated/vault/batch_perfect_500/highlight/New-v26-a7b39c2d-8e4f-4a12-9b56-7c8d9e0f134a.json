Peaked T waves on ECG are a classic sign of hyperkalemia. A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L is significantly elevated and confirms hyperkalemia. Tingling in extremities (paresthesia) is another symptom of hyperkalemia due to altered nerve excitability.",

'Missed dialysis appointment' is a risk factor for hyperkalemia in CKD patients but does not directly confirm it. 'Bradycardia' can be related, but other factors such as medications may cause it. 'BP 100/60' is hypotension, which may be related to the patient's condition but not specific to hyperkalemia. 'Patient feels lethargic' is a non-specific symptom.",

He reports missing his dialysis appointment yesterday due to transportation issues. B: His baseline creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. He takes lisinopril and metoprolol daily. A: At 04:00, his ECG showed peaked T waves. Current vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 95% on room air. Labs drawn at 03:30 revealed a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L. The patient is currently awake but lethargic and reports tingling in his extremities. O: The patient is on continuous ECG monitoring. I've started him on a cardiac monitor and notified the nephrologist. I anticipate orders for calcium gluconate and possibly insulin/dextrose. Renal diet initiated. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG is ongoing. Repeat potassium level is pending at 05:30.",
