        "correct": "A potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L requires immediate follow up. Hypokalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients taking digoxin or those with underlying heart conditions. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can further deplete potassium levels. A respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute indicates respiratory distress and potential pulmonary edema, requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation. A blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg indicates hypertension, which increases cardiac workload and afterload, exacerbating heart failure. Immediate management is needed to reduce blood pressure and prevent further cardiac strain. A BNP of 1500 pg/mL indicates significant cardiac strain and heart failure exacerbation, requiring immediate assessment and treatment adjustments to reduce fluid overload and improve cardiac function.",
