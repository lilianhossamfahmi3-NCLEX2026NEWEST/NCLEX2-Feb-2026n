  "rationale": {
    "correct": "A potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L requires immediate follow up. Hypokalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients taking digoxin or those with underlying heart conditions. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can further deplete potassium levels.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "device": "Remember 'Potassium Problems Prompt Priority' to recall the urgency of addressing potassium imbalances in cardiac patients.",
      "application": "This mnemonic helps prioritize hypokalemia over other abnormal but less immediately life-threatening findings."
    },
    "incorrect": "A blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and BNP of 1500 pg/mL, while elevated and indicative of heart failure exacerbation, may not require immediate intervention above protocol. These findings support the diagnosis and need for continued monitoring and treatment adjustments, but the potassium level presents a more acute and dangerous risk.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "why": "Test-takers might focus on the obvious signs of heart failure exacerbation (elevated BP, RR, BNP) and overlook the more immediate threat of hypokalemia.",
      "details": "The question asks for the finding requiring 'immediate follow up.' While elevated BP, RR and BNP indicate worsening heart failure, hypokalemia poses an immediate threat to cardiac function and patient safety."
