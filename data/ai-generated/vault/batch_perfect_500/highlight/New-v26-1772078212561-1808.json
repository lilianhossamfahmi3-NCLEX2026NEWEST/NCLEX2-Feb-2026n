    "correct": "A potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L requires immediate follow up. Hypokalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients taking digoxin or those with underlying heart conditions. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can further deplete potassium levels.",
    "incorrect": "A blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and BNP of 1500 pg/mL, while elevated and indicative of heart failure exacerbation, may not require immediate intervention above protocol. These findings support the diagnosis and need for continued monitoring and treatment adjustments, but the potassium level presents a more acute and dangerous risk.",
