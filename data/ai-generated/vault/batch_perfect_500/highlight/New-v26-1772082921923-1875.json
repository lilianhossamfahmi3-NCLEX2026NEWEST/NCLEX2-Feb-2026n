Rationale: In the setting of suspected placental abruption, continuous fetal monitoring is crucial to assess fetal well-being and detect signs of fetal distress. A non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern necessitates immediate intervention. Continuous fetal monitoring allows for prompt identification of fetal distress, guiding timely interventions such as emergency cesarean section to optimize fetal outcomes. Placental abruption can compromise fetal oxygenation, making continuous monitoring essential.",
