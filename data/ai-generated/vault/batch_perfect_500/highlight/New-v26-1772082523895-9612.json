        "correct": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal compromise, requiring immediate intervention to improve fetal oxygenation and prevent further fetal distress. This can be caused by maternal hypotension, uterine tachysystole, or placental abnormalities. Interventions include repositioning the mother to her left side, administering oxygen via face mask, increasing intravenous fluids, and notifying the healthcare provider. Continuous monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions.",

        "incorrect": "While elevated blood pressure, temperature, and anxiety are important findings, they are not as immediately threatening to the fetus as late decelerations. Elevated blood pressure may indicate preeclampsia, but it does not pose an immediate threat to fetal oxygenation. Elevated temperature may indicate infection, but it is not as critical as addressing fetal distress. Anxiety is a common symptom during labor, but it does not directly impact fetal well-being.",
