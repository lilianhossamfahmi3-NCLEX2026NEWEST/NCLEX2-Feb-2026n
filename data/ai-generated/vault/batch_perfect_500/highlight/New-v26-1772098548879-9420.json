        "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. This position optimizes cerebral perfusion and minimizes pressure. Administering stool softeners prevents straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver), which can acutely increase ICP. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary response) allow for early detection of changes in ICP, guiding timely interventions. A quiet environment reduces external stimuli that can exacerbate ICP by minimizing neuronal excitation and metabolic demand. Limiting stimulation is key to preventing further increases in ICP.",
        "mnemonic": "ELEVATE: Elevate head, Limit stimuli, Evaluate neuro status, Ventilate, Avoid straining, Titrate fluids",
        "incorrect": "Clustering nursing activities can cause transient increases in ICP due to increased stimulation and manipulation. Spacing out care activities helps maintain a stable intracranial environment. Suctioning can increase ICP; it should be done only when necessary and with preoxygenation to minimize hypoxia-induced ICP elevation. Coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain, increasing ICP. Encouraging deep breathing can increase intrathoracic pressure, potentially hindering cerebral venous drainage and elevating ICP. Controlled ventilation is preferred.",
        "questionTrap": "The question requires the nurse to differentiate between interventions that increase and decrease ICP. Nurses must understand the physiological impact of each intervention on intracranial dynamics.",

Background: He has a history of hypertension and is currently post-operative day 1 from a craniotomy to evacuate a subdural hematoma. Assessment: His current ICP is 22 mmHg (elevated), with a MAP of 90 mmHg. He is on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 40%, RR 16, TV 500. GCS is 9 (E2, V2, M5). Pupils are equal and reactive, but sluggish. There is a Penlight reflex. He is receiving mannitol 0.25 g/kg IV q6h. Recommendation: Continue to monitor ICP and neurological status closely. Titrate mannitol as needed to maintain ICP < 20 mmHg. Consider further interventions if ICP remains elevated, such as increasing sedation or adjusting ventilator settings.
