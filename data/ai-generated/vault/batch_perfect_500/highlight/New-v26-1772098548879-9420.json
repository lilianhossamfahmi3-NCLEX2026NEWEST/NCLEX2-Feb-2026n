    "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering stool softeners prevents straining during bowel movements, which can increase ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes in ICP. Maintaining a quiet environment reduces external stimuli that can increase ICP.",

    "incorrect": "Clustering nursing activities can cause transient increases in ICP. Suctioning can increase ICP; it should be done only when necessary and with preoxygenation. Coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressure, which can increase ICP. Encouraging deep breathing can increase intrathoracic pressure, which can increase ICP.",
