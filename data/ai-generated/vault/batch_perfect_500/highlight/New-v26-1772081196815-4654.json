        "correct": "A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg indicates hypotension, which, in the context of chest pain and elevated troponin, suggests cardiogenic shock or severe myocardial dysfunction. Immediate intervention is required to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion, making this the most critical finding. The low blood pressure indicates that the heart is not effectively pumping blood to meet the body's needs, potentially leading to organ damage and failure if not promptly addressed.",

        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated (tachycardia), but is expected with pain and stress; the hypotension is more concerning. While an oxygen saturation of 92% on 2L is not optimal, it's not immediately life-threatening compared to hypotension. A pain level of 6/10 is significant, but addressing the underlying cause (hypotension and potential ischemia) is the priority. Crackles in bilateral lower lobes is a concerning finding, but hypotension is more immediately life-threatening. Elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac damage; however, the low blood pressure necessitates immediate intervention to prevent further damage. Diaphoresis, while concerning, is not as immediately life-threatening as the low blood pressure.",
