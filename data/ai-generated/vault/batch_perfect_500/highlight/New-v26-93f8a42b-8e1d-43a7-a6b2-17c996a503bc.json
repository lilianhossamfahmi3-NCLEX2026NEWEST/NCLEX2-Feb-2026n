    "correct": "The highlighted findings support hypovolemic shock. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) indicates reduced circulating volume and decreased cardiac output. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased stroke volume. Tachypnea (RR 28 bpm) is another compensatory mechanism to improve oxygenation. Decreased SpO2 (92% on 2L NC) signifies impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL and Hematocrit of 29% both indicate blood loss. Urine output of 15 mL/hr suggests decreased renal perfusion due to hypovolemia. Diaphoresis is a sympathetic response to hypovolemia. The patient's complaint of dizziness further supports the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock due to reduced cerebral perfusion from decreased blood volume.",

B: History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Surgical procedure was uncomplicated. A: At 07:30, the patient is pale, diaphoretic, and complaining of dizziness. Current vital signs: BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 28 bpm, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, Temp 37.0°C. Urine output over the past hour was 15 mL. Dressing saturated with blood; estimated blood loss 300 mL since last assessment. U: I am concerned about hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss. I recommend immediate assessment, fluid resuscitation, and notification of the surgeon. Labs drawn at 07:45. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated at 07:40. Requesting orders for a STAT complete blood count and coagulation studies.",
