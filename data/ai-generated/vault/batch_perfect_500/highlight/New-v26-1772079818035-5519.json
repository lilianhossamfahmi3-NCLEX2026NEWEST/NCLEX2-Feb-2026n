He is confused and disoriented. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Skin is warm and flushed. Foley catheter in place with cloudy urine. R: Concerned for sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection. Requesting orders for blood cultures, urine culture, antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation.",

    "correct": "Elevated white blood cell count (WBC > 12,000) and hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) are two key criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis. Elevated lactate is also a sign of tissue hypoperfusion, often associated with sepsis.",
    "incorrect": "While fever is a common symptom of infection, it is not specific to sepsis. Confusion is also a common symptom of sepsis, but by itself is not enough to diagnose. Tachycardia and tachypnea, while concerning, are less specific than hypotension and leukocytosis in this context. Elevated creatinine and BUN suggest worsening kidney function, likely related to hypoperfusion from sepsis but are less indicative of the initial diagnosis.",
