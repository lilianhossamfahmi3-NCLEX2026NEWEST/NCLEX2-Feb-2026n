        "correct": "Elevated white blood cell count (WBC > 12,000) and hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) are two key criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis. Elevated lactate is also a sign of tissue hypoperfusion, often associated with sepsis. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The body's response to an infection can spiral out of control, leading to widespread inflammation and damage to tissues and organs. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to improving patient outcomes.",

            "name": "qSOFA Criteria",
            "description": "qSOFA (quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) is a simplified tool to identify patients with suspected infection who are likely to have poor outcomes. The criteria include: Altered mental status, Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, Respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min."
        },
        "incorrect": "While fever is a common symptom of infection, it is not specific to sepsis. Confusion is also a common symptom of sepsis, but by itself is not enough to diagnose. Tachycardia and tachypnea, while concerning, are less specific than hypotension and leukocytosis in this context. Elevated creatinine and BUN suggest worsening kidney function, likely related to hypoperfusion from sepsis but are less indicative of the initial diagnosis. These findings can be indicative of other conditions or complications, and should not be prioritized over the key diagnostic criteria for sepsis.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Students often prioritize common symptoms of infection (fever, confusion) over more objective and specific findings like hypotension and significantly elevated WBC count. This is because common symptoms are more frequently encountered, but are less specific to sepsis.",
            "commonMistake": "Focusing solely on fever or altered mental status can lead to a delayed diagnosis. It's crucial to consider the constellation of findings. The diagnosis of sepsis requires a comprehensive assessment of clinical and laboratory data."
