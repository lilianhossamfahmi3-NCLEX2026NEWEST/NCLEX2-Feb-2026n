Heart rate of 180 bpm and respiratory rate of 60 are elevated, indicative of distress and compensatory mechanisms, but addressing the underlying hypoxemia and acidosis is the priority. WBC count of 9,000/mm3 and platelet count of 300,000/mm3 are within normal limits and do not contribute to the acute presentation requiring immediate intervention.",

Mother reports increased frequency of spells in the past week. A: At 0930, infant became acutely cyanotic, agitated, and hyperpneic, consistent with a hypercyanotic spell. O2 saturation dropped from 92% to 78%. Heart rate increased from 120 to 180 bpm. Respiratory rate increased from 32 to 60 bpm, with increased work of breathing. Noted circumoral cyanosis and nasal flaring. Mother at bedside is visibly distressed and anxious. Current IV infusing D10W at 15 mL/hr. Last dose of morphine given at 0300. Respiratory assessment reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally. R: Requesting immediate orders for management of hypercyanotic spell. Consider stat blood gas, morphine administration, and increased oxygen support. Need guidance on further interventions and escalation of care if condition worsens.",
