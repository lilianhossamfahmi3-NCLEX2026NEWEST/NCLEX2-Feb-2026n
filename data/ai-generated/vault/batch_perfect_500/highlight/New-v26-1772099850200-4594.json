The nurse must immediately initiate interventions to lower the potassium level, such as administering medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate). ECG monitoring is also crucial to assess for cardiac changes associated with hyperkalemia.\n\nclinicalPearl: Hyperkalemia in AKI can rapidly progress to a medical emergency. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent adverse cardiac events.\nquestionTrap: While elevated creatinine, BUN, and decreased urine output are expected findings in AKI, hyperkalemia poses the most immediate and life-threatening risk to the client.\nmnemonic: \"K-EXIT\" - Kidneys EXcrete IT (potassium). When kidneys fail, potassium EXits the cells and builds up in the blood.",
