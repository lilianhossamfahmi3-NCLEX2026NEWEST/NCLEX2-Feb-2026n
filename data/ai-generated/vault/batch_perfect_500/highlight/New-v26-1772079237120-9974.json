        "correct": "The patient's oxygen saturation of 90% on 2L nasal cannula, combined with a respiratory rate of 28 and the presence of crackles, indicates impaired gas exchange and potential respiratory distress. This requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and prevent further respiratory compromise. Addressing the respiratory distress is paramount to prevent further deterioration and potential respiratory failure. The elevated respiratory rate and adventitious lung sounds are indicative of the body's attempt to compensate for inadequate oxygenation. Prompt intervention, such as increasing oxygen delivery or assisting with ventilation, is crucial.",

        "incorrect": "Although decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) is concerning in a patient with CKD and fluid overload, the immediate threat is the patient's respiratory compromise. While monitoring urine output is important for assessing fluid balance, it does not take precedence over addressing acute respiratory distress. The kidneys' ability to excrete fluid is compromised in CKD, but the priority is to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Students may be drawn to the elevated potassium level, but the question asks for the MOST immediate intervention, making respiratory distress the higher priority. Hyperkalemia is a significant concern in CKD and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, but the respiratory distress presents a more immediate threat to the patient's life. Addressing the airway and breathing is always the first step in managing a deteriorating patient.",
