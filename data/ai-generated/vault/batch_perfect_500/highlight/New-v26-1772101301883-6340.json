Background: History of central diabetes insipidus, managed with desmopressin. Recent labs show elevated serum osmolality. Assessment: Alert, but reports persistent thirst and frequent urination. Current urine output is high. Vitals stable except for tachycardia (HR 98). Concerns: High urine output (800 mL/hr) despite medication, indicating potential desmopressin resistance or worsening condition. Requires immediate intervention to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Notify provider for potential medication adjustment and further evaluation.",

This requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as hypovolemic shock and electrolyte abnormalities. The nurse should notify the provider immediately for potential adjustments to the desmopressin dosage or alternative interventions.",
        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 96 bpm is within the normal range or slightly elevated, but not an immediate threat in the context of diabetes insipidus. While it should be monitored, it is not the priority compared to the excessive urine output. A blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg is within the normal range and does not require immediate intervention in this scenario. A serum sodium level of 148 mEq/L is slightly elevated, indicating hypernatremia, but the excessive urine output poses a more immediate threat to the client's fluid balance and overall stability. Addressing the urine output will likely help stabilize the sodium levels.",
