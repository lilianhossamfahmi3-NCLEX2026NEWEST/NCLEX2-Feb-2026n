    "sbar": "Sgt. Miller, a 32-year-old male veteran, was admitted at 07:00 today after expressing suicidal ideation to his wife, indicating a pre-existing vulnerability. He served two tours in Afghanistan, a factor known to contribute to PTSD and mental health challenges. His history as a veteran adds complexity to his current state.\n\nAt 09:00, the patient reports feeling increasingly hopeless and states, \"Nothing matters anymore,\" demonstrating a deepening sense of despair. The patient's history of PTSD and depression further exacerbates his current mental state, requiring careful consideration. He is currently on suicide watch, emphasizing the severity of his condition and need for constant monitoring.\n\nAssessment at 11:00 reveals increased agitation, pacing, and tearfulness, all indicators of escalating distress. He is refusing to eat or drink, potentially due to a loss of interest in self-care and a sign of worsening depression. Vital signs are stable, but he is increasingly withdrawn during interactions, signaling a detachment from reality and potential isolation. He’s started making statements such as, \"I'm a burden on everyone,\" expressing feelings of worthlessness and self-blame.\n\nRequesting immediate psychiatric evaluation and consideration for medication adjustment to address his escalating symptoms. Continue close observation and maintain a safe environment to prevent self-harm. Documented plan of care is in place and must be strictly adhered to. Further assessment is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the plan.",
