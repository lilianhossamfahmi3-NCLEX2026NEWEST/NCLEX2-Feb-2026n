B: History of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on warfarin. CT scan confirmed ischemic stroke, and he is eligible for thrombolytic therapy with alteplase. A: NIHSS score is 12. Vital signs are stable (BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air). He is receiving alteplase per protocol. R: We need to closely monitor his neurological status, blood pressure, and for any signs of bleeding. We also need to ensure that his blood pressure is within the acceptable range for alteplase administration.",
