    "correct": "Accurate monitoring of fluid balance is crucial in diabetes insipidus due to the body's inability to regulate fluid. Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin used to reduce urine output. Monitoring for signs of water intoxication is important as desmopressin can cause fluid retention. Maintaining a strict intake and output record helps in assessing fluid balance. Weighing the client daily provides information about fluid retention or loss.",

    "incorrect": "Restricting fluids is contraindicated in diabetes insipidus as it can lead to severe dehydration. Encouraging a low-sodium diet is not a primary intervention for diabetes insipidus; sodium levels are usually normal or high due to water loss. Administering a diuretic would worsen the client's condition by further increasing fluid loss.",
