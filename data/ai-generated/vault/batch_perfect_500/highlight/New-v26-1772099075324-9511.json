        "correct": "Accurate monitoring of fluid balance is crucial in diabetes insipidus due to the body's inability to regulate fluid, preventing dehydration or hypervolemia. Desmopressin, a synthetic vasopressin, reduces urine output, mitigating the primary symptom of DI. Monitoring for water intoxication is vital because desmopressin can cause fluid retention, leading to hyponatremia. Strict intake and output records provide quantifiable data for assessing fluid balance and medication effectiveness. Daily weights are essential for detecting subtle fluid retention or loss, guiding treatment adjustments.",

        "incorrect": "Restricting fluids is contraindicated as it exacerbates dehydration, the primary concern in diabetes insipidus. A low-sodium diet is not indicated; sodium levels are typically normal or elevated due to disproportionate water loss. Diuretics would worsen the client's condition by further increasing fluid loss, leading to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.",
