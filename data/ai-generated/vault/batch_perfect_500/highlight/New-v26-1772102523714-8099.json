A non-stress test (NST) is a non-invasive way to assess fetal well-being by monitoring fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement. It is the priority action to assess fetal status and determine if further intervention is needed. An NST helps to evaluate fetal oxygenation and identify potential fetal distress.",

An NST is needed first to assess fetal well-being. Palpating the abdomen provides limited information about fetal well-being and does not assess fetal oxygenation. Documenting the finding is important for maintaining accurate records, but it is not the priority action. Further assessment via NST is needed first to determine the cause of decreased fetal movement.",
