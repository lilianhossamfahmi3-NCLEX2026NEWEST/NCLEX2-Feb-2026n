        "correct": "Oxygen saturation of 88% on 2L NC and respiratory rate of 28 indicate significant respiratory distress and hypoxemia, requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. A blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg indicates a hypertensive crisis and requires treatment to avoid end-organ damage. Immediate intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration and potential complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction.",

        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 118 bpm, while elevated, is expected given the patient's condition and medications; however, the hypoxia takes priority. A BNP of 850 pg/mL is elevated but is consistent with heart failure and does not require immediate intervention relative to the hypoxia or hypertension. The presence of 3+ pitting edema is consistent with fluid overload in heart failure but is not immediately life-threatening compared to the hypoxemia or hypertensive crisis.",

            "whyItIsWrong": "While elevated BNP and edema are concerning, they do not pose the same immediate threat to life as severe hypoxemia or dangerously high blood pressure. Focusing on these less critical findings can delay necessary interventions.",
