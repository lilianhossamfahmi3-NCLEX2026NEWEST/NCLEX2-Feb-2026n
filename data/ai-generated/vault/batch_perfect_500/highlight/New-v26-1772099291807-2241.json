Actions include repositioning the mother to her left side to relieve pressure on the vena cava, administering oxygen via face mask at 8-10 L/min, increasing intravenous fluids to improve maternal blood volume, and notifying the healthcare provider immediately. Continuous fetal monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions.",
