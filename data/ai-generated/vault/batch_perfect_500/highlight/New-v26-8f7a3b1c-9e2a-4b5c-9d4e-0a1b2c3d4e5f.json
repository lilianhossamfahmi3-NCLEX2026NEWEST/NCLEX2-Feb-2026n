He had a Foley catheter placed this morning at 08:00 due to urinary retention. His last bowel movement was three days ago. \nA: At 14:00, his blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 55 bpm, and he's diaphoretic above the level of injury. He is also complaining of blurred vision. The Foley catheter is draining clear urine. Assess for potential causes of autonomic dysreflexia and implement appropriate interventions.\nR: I recommend checking for kinks in the Foley catheter, assessing for bowel impaction, and administering PRN antihypertensive medication as ordered. Monitor blood pressure closely.",
