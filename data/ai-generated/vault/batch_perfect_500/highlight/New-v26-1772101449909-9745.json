        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP by decreasing cerebral blood volume. Administering stool softeners prevents straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver), which can acutely increase ICP. Maintaining a quiet environment reduces external stimuli that can exacerbate ICP by minimizing neuronal activity and metabolic demand. Frequent neurological assessments allow for early detection of changes in ICP, enabling timely intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
        "incorrect": "Clustering nursing activities can cause transient increases in ICP due to increased stimulation and manipulation, negating the benefits of rest. Encouraging coughing increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can transiently increase ICP. Hyperextending the neck can obstruct venous drainage from the brain, increasing ICP by compressing jugular veins.",
