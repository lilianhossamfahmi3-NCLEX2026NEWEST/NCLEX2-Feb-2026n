        "correct": "Hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) and decreased oxygen saturation (92% on room air) are critical findings in sepsis indicating impaired tissue perfusion and respiratory compromise, requiring immediate intervention such as fluid resuscitation and oxygen administration. The body's compensatory mechanisms are failing, necessitating immediate action to support vital organ function.",
        "mnemonic": "Think 'STOP Sepsis': Signs, Treatment, Oxygen, Perfusion. Perfusion issues (hypotension, low O2 sat) are top priority.",
        "incorrect": "Elevated temperature (101.5°F) and increased heart rate (110 bpm) are expected findings in sepsis as the body attempts to fight infection, but hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation are more immediately life-threatening. Increased respiratory rate (24 breaths/min) is also expected as the body tries to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery, but the oxygen saturation indicates the patient is not compensating adequately. These findings, while important, are not the priority for immediate intervention compared to perfusion and oxygenation issues.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may focus on the elevated temperature and heart rate, which are common in sepsis, but the critical findings are hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation, indicating a failure of compensatory mechanisms and a higher risk of organ damage.",

Current vital signs: Temperature 38.6°C, Heart Rate 110 bpm, Respiratory Rate 24 breaths/min, Blood Pressure 90/60 mmHg, Oxygen Saturation 92% on room air. The patient appears lethargic and slightly confused. Urine output has decreased over the last 2 hours. The patient is currently on IV fluids at 100 mL/hr. I am concerned about possible septic shock and the need for more aggressive fluid resuscitation and possible vasopressors. I recommend reassessing the patient and considering escalation of care.",
