        "correct": "A decreased respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute in a COPD patient receiving oxygen is concerning for oxygen-induced hypoventilation. COPD patients rely on hypoxia to stimulate breathing, and excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to respiratory depression. The ABG results show elevated PaCO2, which supports the concern for hypoventilation.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry reading of 90% is within the acceptable range for many COPD patients, who often have chronically lower oxygen saturation levels. While ideal saturation may vary, 90% is not immediately life-threatening.\nMild wheezing heard on auscultation is a common finding in COPD patients, especially during exacerbations. While it indicates airway narrowing, it does not necessarily require immediate intervention unless accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress.\nComplaints of increased dyspnea with exertion are expected in COPD patients and do not represent an acute change requiring immediate intervention.",
