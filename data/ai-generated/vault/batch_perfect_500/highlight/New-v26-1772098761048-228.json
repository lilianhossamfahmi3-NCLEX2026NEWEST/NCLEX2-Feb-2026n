        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 8 breaths/min indicates significant hypoventilation and potential respiratory failure in a COPD patient. This requires immediate intervention, such as assisted ventilation, to prevent further respiratory compromise, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis. COPD patients rely on hypoxic drive to breathe, and excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to a dangerously low respiratory rate.",
        "mnemonic": "SLOW: Severely Low Oxygen Warning. Be alert for dangerously low respiratory rates in COPD patients on oxygen.",
        "incorrect": "A pulse oximetry of 92% is within the acceptable range for COPD patients, who often have a lower baseline oxygen saturation target (88-92%). While it should be monitored, it does not require immediate intervention. Mild dyspnea and a productive cough with clear sputum are common in COPD patients and do not necessarily indicate an emergency.",
        "questionTrap": "The question focuses on 'immediate intervention,' so the correct answer is the one that poses the most immediate threat to the patient's well-being. While other findings may warrant attention, a respiratory rate of 8 is the most critical.",

            "COPD patients are at risk for hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis due to impaired gas exchange.",
            "Oxygen therapy should be carefully titrated to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive, which can lead to respiratory depression.",
            "Monitor respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness closely in COPD patients receiving oxygen.",
            "A respiratory rate below 12 breaths/min in a COPD patient should be promptly addressed."
