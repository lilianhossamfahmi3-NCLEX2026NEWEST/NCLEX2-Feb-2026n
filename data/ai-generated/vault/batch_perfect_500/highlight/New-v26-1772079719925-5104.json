        "correct": "Blood pressure 90/50 mmHg indicates hypotension, which can compromise coronary perfusion and worsen ischemia in the setting of AMI. This requires immediate intervention to improve blood pressure and cardiac output. Elevated troponin (0.8 ng/mL) is a cardiac-specific marker of myocardial damage, strongly suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. This finding warrants immediate intervention to limit infarct size and prevent complications.",

        "incorrect": "Heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated but is expected given the patient's pain and anxiety. Addressing the underlying cause (AMI) will likely resolve the tachycardia. Respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute is elevated, but the oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, suggesting adequate oxygenation. While monitoring is important, it is not the most critical issue requiring immediate intervention. Pain scale 8/10 indicates significant pain, but pain management is already addressed in the care plan with morphine PRN. Addressing the underlying cause (AMI) will ultimately reduce the pain. Glucose of 210 mg/dL is elevated, but not the most immediate concern compared to the hypotension and elevated troponin in the setting of suspected AMI. Oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, while not ideal, is acceptable in the acute setting. The patient's hypotension and elevated troponin are of greater immediate concern.",
