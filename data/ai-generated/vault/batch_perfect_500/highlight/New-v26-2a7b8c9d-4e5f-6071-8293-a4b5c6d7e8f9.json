        "correct": "Elevated WBC count (18,000/mm3) indicates the body is fighting an infection. Elevated Lactate (4.5 mmol/L) suggests tissue hypoperfusion. Elevated Creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (35 mg/dL) point to kidney injury, possibly due to decreased perfusion. Low Platelets (140,000/mm3) can be a sign of DIC. Elevated Procalcitonin (8 ng/mL) is a strong indicator of bacterial infection and sepsis. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) is a key sign of septic shock. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is the body's attempt to compensate for decreased perfusion. Tachypnea (RR 28) is the body's attempt to increase oxygenation. Fever (38.9°C) is a systemic inflammatory response to infection.",

B: Mr. Smith has a history of COPD and hypertension. I've noticed an increased work of breathing and altered mental status during my shift. O: At 07:00, his temperature was 38.9°C, heart rate 122 bpm, respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 88/52 mmHg, and SpO2 90% on 2L NC. The patient is lethargic and confused. Urine output has decreased significantly to 20 mL/hr. There's also a notable wound site on his right forearm, at the IV insertion point, which is erythematous with purulent drainage. A: I suspect sepsis secondary to pneumonia and a possible IV site infection. I'm requesting orders for blood cultures, lactate level, and a fluid bolus. I will notify the provider STAT if his condition continues to deteriorate or if any concerning changes occur.",
