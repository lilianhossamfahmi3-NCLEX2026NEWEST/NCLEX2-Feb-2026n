    "correct": "The patient's blood pressure of 90/60 in the context of a recent MI, ongoing chest pain, elevated troponin, and S3 gallop is indicative of cardiogenic shock. This requires immediate intervention to improve cardiac output and perfusion.",

    "incorrect": "While the elevated troponin and CK-MB are concerning for myocardial infarction, they do not require as immediate intervention as the low blood pressure. The low blood pressure suggests the heart is unable to pump effectively. While the S3 gallop is indicative of heart failure, the hypotension is a more immediate threat to organ perfusion. While the elevated glucose needs addressing, the blood pressure is far more important right now.",
