Urine protein of 3+ is expected with preeclampsia, but does not warrant immediate intervention compared to thrombocytopenia or hyperreflexia. Notifying the provider is important but less immediate than addressing the patient's oxygenation and fluid status. Preparing for intubation is premature without further assessment of respiratory status. Administering analgesia does not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia.",
