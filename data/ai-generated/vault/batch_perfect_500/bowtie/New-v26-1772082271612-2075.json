        "correct": "Tachycardia is a common manifestation of hyperthyroidism due to increased sympathetic activity on the heart, leading to an elevated heart rate. Heat intolerance occurs because of increased metabolism, resulting in increased heat production and sensitivity to warmer temperatures. Weight loss occurs due to the hypermetabolic state associated with hyperthyroidism, where the body burns calories at a faster rate. Insomnia is a frequent symptom due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, making it difficult to fall or stay asleep. Fine tremors are a result of the stimulation of the neuromuscular system by excess thyroid hormone, causing involuntary shaking.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Bradycardia is associated with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, as hypothyroidism leads to a slowed metabolic rate and decreased heart rate. Constipation is more common in hypothyroidism due to slowed metabolism, leading to reduced bowel motility. Weight gain is associated with hypothyroidism due to decreased metabolism, causing the body to store more calories as fat. Decreased appetite is not typical; increased appetite with weight loss is more characteristic of hyperthyroidism due to the body's increased energy demands. Coarse hair is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism, where decreased thyroid hormone levels can affect hair texture and growth.",
