    "correct": "Tachycardia is a common manifestation of hyperthyroidism due to increased sympathetic activity on the heart. Heat intolerance occurs because of increased metabolism leading to increased heat production. Weight loss occurs due to the hypermetabolic state associated with hyperthyroidism. Insomnia is a frequent symptom due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Fine tremors are a result of the stimulation of the neuromuscular system by excess thyroid hormone.",
    "incorrect": "Bradycardia is associated with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Constipation is more common in hypothyroidism due to slowed metabolism. Weight gain is associated with hypothyroidism due to decreased metabolism. Decreased appetite is not typical; increased appetite with weight loss is more characteristic of hyperthyroidism. Coarse hair is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism.",
