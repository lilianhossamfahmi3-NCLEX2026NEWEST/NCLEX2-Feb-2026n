    "correct": "The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke due to the sudden onset of focal neurological deficits. Rapid blood pressure reduction is crucial to minimize further brain injury and prevent hemorrhagic transformation. Activating the stroke team is paramount for timely assessment, diagnosis, and potential intervention (e.g., thrombolysis).",
    "incorrect": "While hemorrhagic stroke is a possibility, it is less likely given the absence of headache or altered level of consciousness.  Waiting for lab results or a CT scan before acting delays potentially life-saving treatment. While further investigation is needed, the patient's symptoms indicate a highly likely ischemic stroke which requires immediate intervention. Allowing permissive hypertension may worsen the patient's condition by increasing edema and possibly causing hemorrhage.",
