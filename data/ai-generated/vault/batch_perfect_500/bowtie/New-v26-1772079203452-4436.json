        "correct": "The patient's presentation (sudden onset right-sided weakness, slurred speech) strongly suggests acute stroke.  Ischemic stroke is more likely given the history of atrial fibrillation. Activating the stroke team ensures rapid assessment and intervention. A CT scan is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Permissive hypertension is often allowed initially to maintain cerebral perfusion in ischemic stroke, unless there are other contraindications.

While labs are important, they should not delay immediate actions. Aspirin is contraindicated until hemorrhage is ruled out.
