    "correct": "Hyperkalemia requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiac complications. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium into cells, and remove potassium from the body, respectively. Monitoring ECG changes is crucial to detect cardiac arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Restricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Encouraging fluid intake is generally beneficial for kidney patients but not specifically indicated for hyperkalemia and could be harmful depending on the patient's fluid status.",
