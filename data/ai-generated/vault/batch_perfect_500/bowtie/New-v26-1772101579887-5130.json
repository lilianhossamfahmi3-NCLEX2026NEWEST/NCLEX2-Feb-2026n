        "correct": "Hyperkalemia requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiac complications. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium into cells, and remove potassium from the body, respectively. Monitoring ECG changes is crucial to detect cardiac arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Restricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Encouraging fluid intake is generally beneficial for kidney patients but not specifically indicated for hyperkalemia and could be harmful depending on the patient's fluid status.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardiac stabilization but does not lower potassium levels. Insulin and glucose offer a temporary shift of potassium into cells, while Kayexalate removes potassium from the body more slowly.\n\n**Question Trap:** Focus on immediate, life-saving interventions for hyperkalemia, not long-term management or interventions that don't directly address the elevated potassium.",
        "incorrect": "Some options are long-term management strategies or not directly related to the immediate treatment of hyperkalemia. Others may be contraindicated or less effective in acutely lowering potassium levels.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize interventions based on the immediacy of the threat to the patient's life. In hyperkalemia, cardiac complications are the primary concern.\n\n**Question Trap:** Be wary of options that seem generally beneficial but are not specific to the acute management of hyperkalemia.",
