    "correct": "Rapid assessment and intervention are critical in managing acute ischemic stroke to minimize brain damage and improve patient outcomes.  Immediate actions include: (1) Obtaining a CT scan of the head without contrast to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. Thrombolytics are contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke. (2) Establishing IV access for medication administration and fluid resuscitation. (3) Monitoring vital signs frequently, paying particular attention to blood pressure and oxygen saturation. (4) Performing a neurological assessment using a standardized scale like NIHSS to quantify the deficit and track changes.",
    "incorrect": "(1) Administering aspirin before confirming the type of stroke can be harmful if the stroke is hemorrhagic. (2) Delaying a CT scan will delay treatment and increase the risk of permanent brain damage. (3) Waiting for lab results (beyond a point-of-care glucose) before obtaining a CT scan will delay diagnosis and treatment. (4) Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position can increase intracranial pressure and is not indicated in stroke. (5) Encouraging oral fluids before swallowing evaluation can lead to aspiration.",
