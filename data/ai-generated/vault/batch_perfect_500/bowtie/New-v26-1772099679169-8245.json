    "correct": "Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, and remove potassium from the body, respectively. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage any arrhythmias. A low-potassium diet helps prevent further elevation of potassium levels. Dialysis may be necessary if other measures are ineffective.",
    "incorrect": "While monitoring potassium levels is important, it is not an action. Administering potassium supplements would worsen the hyperkalemia. Encouraging potassium-rich foods would exacerbate the condition. Restricting fluids may be appropriate for other conditions but is not the primary intervention for hyperkalemia. Administering a diuretic alone is not sufficient to address severe hyperkalemia.",
