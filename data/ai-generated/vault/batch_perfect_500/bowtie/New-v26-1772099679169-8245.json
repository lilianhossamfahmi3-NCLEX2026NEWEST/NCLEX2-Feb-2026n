        "correct": "Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Administering calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of arrhythmias. Insulin with glucose shifts potassium intracellularly, lowering serum potassium levels. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) binds to potassium in the GI tract, facilitating its removal from the body. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial for detecting and managing arrhythmias. A low-potassium diet helps prevent further elevation of potassium levels. Dialysis may be necessary if other measures are ineffective. clinicalPearl: ECG changes are common in hyperkalemia and can include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and widened QRS complex. questionTrap: The question focuses on the MOST important actions, requiring prioritization of interventions that directly address the life-threatening hyperkalemia. mnemonic: K-BIG: Kayexalate, Beta-agonists, Insulin, Glucose",
        "incorrect": "While monitoring potassium levels is important, it is not an immediate action to address the hyperkalemia. Administering potassium supplements would worsen the hyperkalemia. Encouraging potassium-rich foods would exacerbate the condition. Restricting fluids may be appropriate for other conditions but is not the primary intervention for hyperkalemia. Administering a loop diuretic alone is not sufficient to address severe hyperkalemia. clinicalPearl: Hyperkalemia is a critical electrolyte imbalance that requires prompt intervention. questionTrap: The question focuses on the MOST important actions, requiring prioritization of interventions that directly address the life-threatening hyperkalemia. mnemonic: K-BIG: Kayexalate, Beta-agonists, Insulin, Glucose",
