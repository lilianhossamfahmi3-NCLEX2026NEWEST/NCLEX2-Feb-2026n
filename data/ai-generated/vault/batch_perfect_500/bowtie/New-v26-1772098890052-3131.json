    "correct": "Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist that causes bronchodilation, relieving wheezing and improving airflow. Oxygen administration is crucial to address hypoxemia. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic that can further reduce bronchospasm. Monitoring heart rate is important because albuterol can cause tachycardia.",
    "mnemonic": "A-Airway, B-Breathing, C-Circulation (for initial assessment); Albuterol Opens Airways (for medication)",
    "incorrect": "Administering a sedative is contraindicated in a patient with respiratory distress as it can further depress respiratory drive. Withholding oxygen in a hypoxemic patient is detrimental. Administering antihistamines is not indicated for acute asthma exacerbation. Placing the patient in a supine position can worsen respiratory distress.",
