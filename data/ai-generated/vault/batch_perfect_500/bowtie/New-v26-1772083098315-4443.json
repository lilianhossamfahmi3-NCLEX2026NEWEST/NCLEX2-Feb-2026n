    "correct": "Monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g., tachycardia, anxiety, insomnia) is crucial as levothyroxine can cause hyperthyroidism if the dose is too high. Educating the client to take the medication on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning, improves absorption. Checking the client's heart rate and blood pressure is essential, as levothyroxine can affect cardiovascular function.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the medication with food can decrease its absorption. Discontinuing the medication if the client feels better is incorrect, as it's a long-term treatment, and stopping abruptly can lead to relapse of hypothyroid symptoms. Waiting until bedtime to administer the medication is incorrect; morning administration on an empty stomach is preferred for optimal absorption.",
