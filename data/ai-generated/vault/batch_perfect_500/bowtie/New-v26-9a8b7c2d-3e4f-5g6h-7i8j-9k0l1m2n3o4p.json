    "correct": "The patient's presentation (fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated WBC and lactate) strongly suggests sepsis. Administering antibiotics after obtaining cultures is crucial to combat the infection. Initiating a fluid bolus addresses the hypotension and supports organ perfusion. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess kidney function and response to fluid resuscitation. The primary reason for the client's condition is likely a bacterial infection due to recent antibiotic use, increasing the risk of multi-drug resistant organisms. Potential complications include septic shock, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Septic shock results from widespread vasodilation and impaired tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury occurs due to decreased renal blood flow. DIC is a life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body.",

    "incorrect": "Holding antibiotics delays treatment of the infection and can lead to worsening sepsis. Administering an anti-diarrheal is not indicated and does not address the underlying problem. Encouraging oral fluids is insufficient for a hypotensive patient and may not be tolerated due to altered mental status. While monitoring blood glucose is important, it is not the priority in the acute management of sepsis. While viral infections can cause sepsis, the patient's recent antibiotic use and clinical presentation are more suggestive of a bacterial etiology. Hypovolemic shock can occur, but in this case, it is secondary to the vasodilation caused by sepsis rather than primary fluid loss. Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is possible given the elevated glucose, but the primary concern is the sepsis and hemodynamic instability. Pulmonary embolism is less likely given the clinical picture.",
