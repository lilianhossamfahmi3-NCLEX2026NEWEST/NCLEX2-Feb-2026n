His overdose, coupled with feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, strongly indicates Major Depressive Disorder. Given the recent overdose and expressed suicidal ideation with a plan, he is at high risk for suicide.\n\nNursing Actions: Implementing suicide precautions is paramount to ensure the patient's safety. This includes removing potentially harmful objects and continuous observation. Notifying the psychiatric provider is crucial to discuss the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan. Initiating a thorough mental health assessment is necessary to gather more information about the patient's history, current state, and needs.\n\nParameters to Monitor: Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential due to the recent opioid overdose and potential for complications. Frequent assessment of the patient's mental status, including suicidal ideation and mood, is critical to detect any changes in risk. Monitoring for signs of opioid withdrawal is important, as abrupt cessation of opioid use can lead to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms.",
