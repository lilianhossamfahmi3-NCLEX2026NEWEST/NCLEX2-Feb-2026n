    "correct": "Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, or remove potassium from the body, respectively. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage any arrhythmias. Restricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but is not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Monitoring urine output is important for overall kidney function assessment but does not directly address the elevated potassium level. Administering a diuretic may help excrete potassium, but it is not the first-line treatment for severe hyperkalemia and may not be appropriate depending on the patient's kidney function.",
    "incorrect": "Options that do not directly address the immediate threat of hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias are incorrect. Restricting dietary potassium is a long-term strategy, not an acute intervention. Monitoring urine output is important but doesn't directly lower potassium.
