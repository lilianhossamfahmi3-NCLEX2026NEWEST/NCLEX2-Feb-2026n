    "correct": "The patient is in cardiogenic shock, requiring immediate interventions to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The priority nursing actions are: 1. Administer prescribed vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine): To increase blood pressure and improve tissue perfusion by vasoconstriction. 2. Administer prescribed inotropes (e.g., dobutamine): To enhance myocardial contractility and increase cardiac output. 3. Monitor hemodynamic status continuously: Closely monitor blood pressure, heart rate, CVP, PAWP, and urine output to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Potential conditions include: Worsening renal failure due to decreased perfusion, and pulmonary edema due to increased PAWP and fluid overload. Hemodynamic instability is reflected by: Decreased blood pressure (hypotension), elevated CVP indicating increased preload, elevated PAWP indicating pulmonary congestion, and decreased urine output indicating inadequate renal perfusion.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock and the appropriate nursing interventions. Delaying vasopressor administration in the setting of hypotension can lead to further tissue hypoperfusion and organ damage. Failing to administer inotropes compromises cardiac output. Administering large boluses of fluids can exacerbate pulmonary edema and worsen the patient's respiratory status. Ignoring the signs of renal dysfunction and pulmonary edema can lead to further complications and increased morbidity.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "Many students may be tempted to administer a fluid bolus due to the low blood pressure. However, in cardiogenic shock, the problem is not hypovolemia, but rather the heart's inability to pump effectively. Fluid boluses can worsen pulmonary edema.",
      "howToOvercome": "Carefully assess the patient's hemodynamic parameters, particularly CVP and PAWP. Elevated CVP and PAWP suggest fluid overload, making fluid boluses contraindicated. Focus on improving cardiac contractility and reducing afterload instead."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In cardiogenic shock, avoid aggressive fluid boluses unless hypovolemia is clearly present, as it can worsen pulmonary edema.",

      "Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is essential to assess the patient's response to therapy and detect any complications."
