    "correct": "Sudden loss of bowel or bladder control can indicate cauda equina syndrome, a surgical emergency. Clear fluid leaking from the incision site could indicate a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which increases the risk of meningitis. New onset lower extremity weakness is concerning for nerve compression or damage.",
    "incorrect": "Increased pain at the surgical site is expected in the immediate post-operative period, although it should be managed with pain medication. A temperature of 99.2°F (37.3°C) is within the normal range or slightly elevated and may be due to the inflammatory response from surgery. While frequent monitoring is necessary, it does not require immediate intervention unless accompanied by other signs of infection. Mild edema at the incision site is a normal finding in the early post-operative phase.",
