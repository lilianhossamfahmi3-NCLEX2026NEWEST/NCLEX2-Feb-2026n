However, a sudden increase disproportionate to the expected level should raise concern. A temperature of 99.2°F (37.3°C) is within the normal range or slightly elevated and may be due to the inflammatory response from surgery. While frequent monitoring is necessary, it does not require immediate intervention unless accompanied by other signs of infection. Mild edema at the incision site is a normal finding in the early post-operative phase due to the surgical trauma and inflammatory response.",
