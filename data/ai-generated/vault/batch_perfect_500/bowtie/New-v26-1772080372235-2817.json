        "correct": "Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is indicated to lower elevated potassium levels by exchanging sodium for potassium in the intestines, facilitating potassium excretion. Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring is essential due to the risk of arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Administering a bolus of normal saline is indicated to improve hydration and renal perfusion, addressing the dehydration component of AKI. Restricting fluid intake is important to prevent fluid overload, given the decreased urine output and AKI. Consulting nephrology is indicated for specialist input on the management of AKI and potential need for dialysis.",

        "incorrect": "Administering furosemide (Lasix) is contraindicated because the patient is hypotensive and potentially volume depleted; it can worsen AKI by further reducing renal perfusion. Providing a high-potassium diet is contraindicated as the patient is already hyperkalemic, and increasing potassium intake would exacerbate this life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. Administering NSAIDs is contraindicated as these are nephrotoxic and likely contributed to the AKI; they can further impair renal function.",
