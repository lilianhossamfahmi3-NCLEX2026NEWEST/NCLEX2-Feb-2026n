    "correct": "Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps lower the elevated potassium. Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring is essential due to the hyperkalemia and potential for arrhythmias.  Administering a bolus of normal saline helps to improve hydration and renal perfusion. Restricting fluid intake is important to prevent fluid overload, given the decreased urine output and AKI. Consult nephrology for specialist input on management of AKI.",
    "incorrect": "Administering furosemide (Lasix) is contraindicated because the patient is hypotensive and potentially volume depleted; it can worsen AKI. Providing a high-potassium diet is contraindicated as the patient is already hyperkalemic. Administering NSAIDs is contraindicated as these are nephrotoxic and likely contributed to the AKI.",
