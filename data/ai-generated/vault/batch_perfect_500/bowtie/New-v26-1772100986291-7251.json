Mastitis presents with localized breast pain, redness, and fever. Deep vein thrombosis presents with unilateral leg pain, swelling, and warmth. While postpartum depression is a concern, it does not directly cause the physical symptoms described. Cervical laceration would likely have been identified during the delivery process.
