Displacement to the right suggests a full bladder, which interferes with uterine contraction by physically preventing the uterus from contracting properly.

While postpartum depression is a concern, it does not directly cause the physical symptoms described. Cervical laceration would likely have been identified during the delivery process. Normal lochia rubra is expected in the first few days postpartum, but not with large clots and a boggy uterus in conjunction with a boggy uterus.",
