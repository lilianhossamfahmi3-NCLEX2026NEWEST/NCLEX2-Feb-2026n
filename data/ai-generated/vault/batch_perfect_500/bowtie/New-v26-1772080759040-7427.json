    "correct": "Administering IV fluids helps to improve renal perfusion and potentially reverse AKI caused by dehydration. Monitoring potassium levels is crucial in AKI patients due to the risk of hyperkalemia. Restricting fluids is essential to prevent fluid overload, especially with decreased urine output and pulmonary congestion. Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to lower elevated potassium levels. Assessing daily weights helps to monitor fluid balance and response to treatment.",
