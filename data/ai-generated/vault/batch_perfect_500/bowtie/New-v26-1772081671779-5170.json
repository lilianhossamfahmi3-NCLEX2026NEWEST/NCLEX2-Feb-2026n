    "correct": "Decreased fetal movement can indicate fetal distress and requires immediate investigation. Continuous fetal monitoring helps assess fetal heart rate and identify potential problems such as fetal hypoxia. Initiating oxygen administration can improve fetal oxygenation if fetal distress is suspected. Notifying the healthcare provider promptly ensures timely medical intervention based on the assessment findings.",

    "incorrect": "Palpating the fundus for contractions is important but not the priority when assessing decreased fetal movement; fetal well-being is the primary concern. Documenting the finding without further action delays necessary interventions. Reassuring the client without assessment could be harmful if fetal distress is present. Offering the client juice may be appropriate later, but assessment of fetal status takes priority. Repositioning the client can be a helpful intervention but after the fetal heart rate has been assessed.",
