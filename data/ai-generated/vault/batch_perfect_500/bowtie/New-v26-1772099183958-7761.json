        "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is crucial in COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Assisting with effective coughing helps clear secretions and improve ventilation. Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Assessing lung sounds helps monitor the effectiveness of interventions and detect any changes in respiratory status. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps slow the respiratory rate and increase alveolar ventilation.",

        "incorrect": "Increasing the albuterol nebulizer frequency without assessment may lead to adverse effects such as tachycardia and tremors. Administering a sedative is contraindicated as it can further depress the respiratory drive. Encouraging fluid restriction is not appropriate as hydration helps thin secretions. Placing the client in a supine position can worsen dyspnea. Performing chest physiotherapy without assessing the client's tolerance may cause discomfort and increased dyspnea.",
