  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Administering prescribed bronchodilators (Albuterol/Ipratropium) helps open airways. Monitoring oxygen saturation continuously allows for timely adjustments to oxygen therapy. Encouraging effective coughing helps clear secretions from the airway.",
    "incorrect": "Limiting fluid intake can thicken secretions and hinder expectoration. (Rationale: Adequate hydration is crucial for thinning secretions in COPD exacerbation.) Encouraging pursed-lip breathing is helpful but less immediately essential than the other interventions in an acute exacerbation. (Rationale: Pursed-lip breathing is a useful technique but less critical in the acute phase of an exacerbation.) Decreasing activity level won't directly improve gas exchange. (Rationale: While rest is important, controlled activity and pulmonary rehabilitation are beneficial long-term.)",
