        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Administering prescribed bronchodilators (Albuterol/Ipratropium) helps open airways by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. Monitoring oxygen saturation continuously allows for timely adjustments to oxygen therapy, preventing hypoxemia or oxygen toxicity. Encouraging effective coughing helps clear secretions from the airway, reducing the risk of infection and improving ventilation. Pursed-lip breathing creates slight back pressure in the airways, preventing alveolar collapse and improving gas exchange.",
