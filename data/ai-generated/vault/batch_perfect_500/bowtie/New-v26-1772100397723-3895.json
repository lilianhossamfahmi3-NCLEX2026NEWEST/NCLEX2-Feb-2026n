Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to bind potassium in the GI tract for excretion, although it may take several hours to have a significant effect. Administering IV calcium gluconate helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmias by raising the threshold potential. Initiating continuous ECG monitoring is crucial to detect any cardiac changes related to hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves or widened QRS complexes.\n\nRestricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Monitoring urine output is important for overall kidney function assessment but is not the priority in acute hyperkalemia. Administering IV fluids may be necessary for hydration but is not the most immediate action to address the elevated potassium level.",
