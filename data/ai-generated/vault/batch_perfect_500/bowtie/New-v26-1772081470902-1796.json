Monitoring serum glucose levels regularly is crucial because cortisol deficiency can lead to hypoglycemia. Encouraging a high-sodium diet helps compensate for sodium loss due to aldosterone deficiency. Teaching the client about the importance of lifelong hormone replacement therapy ensures adherence to treatment and prevents future crises. Educating the client on recognizing signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency enables prompt intervention and prevents Addisonian crisis.",
