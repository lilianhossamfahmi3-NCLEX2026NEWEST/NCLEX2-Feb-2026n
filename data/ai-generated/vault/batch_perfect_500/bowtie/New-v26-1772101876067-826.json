    "incorrect": "While monitoring TSH levels is important, the patient is already symptomatic, indicating a need for more immediate intervention than just routine monitoring. Suggesting the patient is non-compliant without further assessment is premature and potentially harmful. Switching to a different brand of levothyroxine might be considered later if absorption issues are suspected, but the initial step should be to assess the current dose and TSH levels.",
