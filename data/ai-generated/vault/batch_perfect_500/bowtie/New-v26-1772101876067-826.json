        "correct": "The patient's symptoms suggest inadequate thyroid hormone replacement. The current dose of levothyroxine may be insufficient to meet the patient's needs, or there may be issues with absorption or compliance. Further investigation and potential dose adjustment are warranted. The low temperature and heart rate, along with the reported symptoms, are consistent with hypothyroidism.",
        "incorrect": "While monitoring TSH levels is important, the patient is already symptomatic, indicating a need for more immediate intervention than just routine monitoring. Suggesting the patient is non-compliant without further assessment is premature and potentially harmful. Switching to a different brand of levothyroxine might be considered later if absorption issues are suspected, but the initial step should be to assess the current dose and TSH levels. Normal blood pressure and respiratory rate are not directly indicative of hypothyroidism.",
