The priority is to address the underlying metabolic derangement, correct dehydration, and prevent complications such as cerebral edema. Administering oxygen supports tissue perfusion, while IV fluids help correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Continuous monitoring and provider notification are essential for managing this complex condition. Insulin administration is crucial to reduce hyperglycemia and ketogenesis. Potassium replacement is often necessary due to intracellular shifts during insulin therapy.",

Inadequate assessment and delayed treatment can worsen the patient's condition. Administering analgesia without addressing the underlying metabolic issue is inappropriate.
