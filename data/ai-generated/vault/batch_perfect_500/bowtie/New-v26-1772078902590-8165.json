This reflects the intended effect of the medication in diabetes insipidus.",
        "incorrect": "Increased urine output would indicate vasopressin is NOT working effectively, as the client would continue to excrete large volumes of dilute urine.\nDecreased serum osmolality indicates the blood is becoming more dilute as vasopressin reduces free water excretion; however, this alone does not confirm effectiveness and must be considered with other factors like urine output and sodium levels.\nIncreased serum sodium indicates the vasopressin is NOT effectively promoting water reabsorption, leading to a more concentrated sodium level in the blood, which is the opposite of the desired effect.",
