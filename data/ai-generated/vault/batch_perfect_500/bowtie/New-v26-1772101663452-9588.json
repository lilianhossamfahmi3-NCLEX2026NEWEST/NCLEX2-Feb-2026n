        "correct": "A boggy uterus indicates uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contraction, helping to control bleeding. A displaced uterus often indicates bladder distention, which interferes with uterine contraction. Assisting the client to empty her bladder allows the uterus to return to its midline position and contract effectively. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential if the bleeding does not subside after these interventions, as further medical management may be required. The order is crucial to address the immediate risk of hemorrhage.",
        "incorrect": "While assessing vital signs is important, addressing the boggy uterus and bladder distention are the priority to prevent further blood loss. Administering oxygen is not indicated based on the provided information; the client's respiratory rate is within normal limits. Documenting findings is important but should occur after initial interventions to stabilize the client. Increasing IV fluids may be necessary later if hypovolemia develops, but the immediate priority is to address the uterine atony and bladder distention. Applying ice packs is for perineal discomfort and swelling, not uterine atony. Encouraging breastfeeding can help contract the uterus through oxytocin release, but it is not as immediately effective as massage and bladder emptying. Assessing pain is important for client comfort, but not the priority in this situation.",
