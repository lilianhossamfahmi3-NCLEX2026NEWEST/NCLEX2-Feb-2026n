    "correct": "A boggy uterus and displaced uterus indicate uterine atony and bladder distention, increasing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the uterus helps to contract it and expel clots. Assisting the client to empty her bladder allows the uterus to return to its midline position and contract effectively. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential if the bleeding does not subside after these interventions.",
    "incorrect": "While vital signs are important, addressing the boggy uterus and bladder distention are the priority. Administering oxygen is not indicated based on the provided information. Documenting findings is important but should occur after interventions. Increasing IV fluids may be necessary later, but the immediate priority is to address the uterine atony and bladder distention. Applying ice packs is for perineal discomfort, not uterine atony. Encouraging breastfeeding can help contract the uterus, but not as effective as massage and bladder emptying. Assessing pain is important, but not the priority.",
