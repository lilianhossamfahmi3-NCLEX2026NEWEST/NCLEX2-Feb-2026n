Initial post-op course was stable.\nA: At 06:00, patient's SpO2 decreased to 88% despite FiO2 of 50%. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 cm H2O to 35 cm H2O. ABG at 06:30: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, HCO3- 24 mEq/L. The patient is restless and attempting to cough against the ventilator. Current ventilator settings: Assist-Control, Rate 12, Tidal Volume 450 mL, FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O. 06:45: Suctioned moderate amount of thick, white secretions.\nR: I recommend assessing for possible causes of increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance, such as retained secretions, atelectasis, or pneumothorax. Consider adjusting ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Obtain a chest x-ray if indicated. Notify the physician.",
