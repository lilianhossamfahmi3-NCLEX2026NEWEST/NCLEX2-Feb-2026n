Upon arrival, the child is visibly wheezing, has a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The nurse is preparing to administer medications and interventions based on the physician's orders and established protocols. Using the information provided in the chart, identify the interventions that are most likely to improve the child's respiratory status and those that are least likely or potentially harmful.",

        "correct": "Administering albuterol via nebulizer is a first-line treatment for asthma exacerbations because it acts as a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), causing bronchodilation and opening the airways, which facilitates improved airflow. Administering oxygen via nasal cannula is essential to increase the oxygen saturation and alleviate hypoxemia resulting from impaired gas exchange in the lungs. Administering corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, helps reduce inflammation in the airways, which is a key component of asthma exacerbations, leading to improved respiratory function.  \n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and treatment of asthma exacerbations are crucial in preventing respiratory failure. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) used for quick relief of asthma symptoms. Corticosteroids help reduce airway inflammation and prevent further exacerbations.",
        "incorrect": "Administering an antihistamine is not indicated for acute asthma exacerbations because antihistamines target histamine-mediated allergic responses, not the primary bronchoconstriction and inflammation seen in asthma. Encouraging deep breathing exercises may be difficult and ineffective for a child in acute distress, and it may not provide immediate relief from bronchoconstriction. Placing the child in a supine position can worsen respiratory distress by increasing pressure on the diaphragm and reducing lung expansion. \n\nquestionTrap: The question focuses on immediate interventions for an acute asthma exacerbation. Some options might be beneficial in the long term but are not appropriate for immediate relief. \n\nmnemonic: ABC - Albuterol, Breathing support (Oxygen), Corticosteroids",
