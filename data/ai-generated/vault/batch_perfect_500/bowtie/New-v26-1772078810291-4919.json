Respiratory rate of 32 bpm (Kussmaul respirations) is expected in DKA as the body attempts to compensate for metabolic acidosis; while concerning, it's a compensatory mechanism and is being addressed with treatment. Sodium level of 130 mEq/L is low, but not as immediately life-threatening as the potassium level or hypotension.
