Elevated glucose level (580 mg/dL) is expected in DKA and is being addressed with an insulin drip (as per the care plan). Respiratory rate of 32 bpm (Kussmaul respirations) is expected in DKA as the body attempts to compensate for metabolic acidosis; while concerning, it's a compensatory mechanism and is being addressed with treatment. Sodium level of 130 mEq/L is low, but not as immediately life-threatening as the potassium level or hypotension. The acidosis (pH 7.25) is severe, but the insulin drip will help correct this over time.",
