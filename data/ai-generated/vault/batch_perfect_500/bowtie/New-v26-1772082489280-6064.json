  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%: The patient's current SpO2 is 90% on room air, indicating hypoxia. Oxygen administration is a priority to improve oxygenation.\nAdminister nebulized albuterol: Albuterol is a bronchodilator that helps to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow. The patient has received one dose with minimal improvement, so continued administration is indicated.\nAdminister IV corticosteroids: Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation, which is a key component of asthma exacerbations. IV administration is appropriate for a patient with significant respiratory distress.\nAssess respiratory status continuously: Frequent assessment of respiratory status is crucial to monitor the patient's response to treatment and identify any deterioration.\nElevate head of bed: Elevating the head of bed promotes lung expansion and improves breathing.\nMonitor for signs of hypokalemia: Frequent albuterol administration can cause hypokalemia due to intracellular potassium shift, necessitating monitoring of potassium levels.",
    "incorrect": "Withhold albuterol if heart rate increases: While tachycardia is a potential side effect of albuterol, withholding the medication is not appropriate unless there are signs of significant cardiac compromise. The benefits of bronchodilation outweigh the risk of mild tachycardia in this case.\nAdminister a cough suppressant: Cough suppressants are generally contraindicated in patients with asthma exacerbations because they can inhibit airway clearance and worsen mucus plugging.\nEncourage deep breathing exercises: While deep breathing exercises are beneficial for asthma management in stable patients, they can be tiring and ineffective during an acute exacerbation when the patient is already experiencing significant respiratory distress. The priority is to open the airways with bronchodilators first.\nDiscontinue IV fluids if patient is not dehydrated: Maintaining adequate hydration is important to thin secretions and promote airway clearance. Dehydration can worsen mucus plugging.\nPerform chest physiotherapy: Chest physiotherapy is generally contraindicated in acute asthma exacerbations due to the risk of bronchospasm and increased work of breathing.\nInitiate oral antibiotics: There is no indication of bacterial infection in this case. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of pneumonia or other bacterial infection.",
