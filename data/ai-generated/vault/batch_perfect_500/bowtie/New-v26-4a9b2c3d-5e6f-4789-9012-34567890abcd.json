    "correct": "Administering vasopressors is crucial in septic shock when fluid resuscitation alone is insufficient to maintain adequate blood pressure and compromised perfusion. Monitoring urine output is essential for assessing renal perfusion and response to treatment, indicative of end-organ damage. Preparing for mechanical ventilation is necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates despite oxygen therapy, potentially leading to respiratory failure. Starting airborne isolation is crucial to prevent the spread of potentially infectious respiratory illness. The elevated lactate level, creatinine, and BUN, along with minimal urine output, suggest possible acute kidney injury and hypoperfusion. Vasopressors will help increase MAP and improve perfusion to vital organs. Mechanical ventilation will support respiratory function if the patient becomes fatigued or develops ARDS. Airborne isolation will prevent the spread of infection if the patient has a respiratory illness such as TB or influenza.",

    "incorrect": "Administering antipyretics alone will not address the underlying cause of the fever or improve perfusion. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can impair respiratory function and increase intracranial pressure without significantly improving blood pressure. Delaying vasopressor administration in persistent hypotension can lead to irreversible organ damage. While infection control is important, delaying airborne precautions can expose staff and other patients. Restricting fluids further exacerbates hypoperfusion and can worsen kidney injury. The patient needs fluid resuscitation, not restriction.",

B: History of COPD and hypertension. Patient has a productive cough with green sputum. Initial vitals: Temperature 39.5°C, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, BP 80/50 mmHg, SpO2 90% on 2L NC. A: Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) per protocol at 04:15. Lactate is 4.2 mmol/L. Urine output minimal since admission, less than 30 ml/hr. CVP line placed at 04:30. Chest X-ray ordered to rule out pneumonia. R: Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, monitor vital signs closely every 15 minutes, and prepare for possible vasopressor administration if hypotension persists despite fluid boluses. Monitor for signs of end-organ damage, especially renal function. Notify provider of any deterioration in respiratory status or vital signs. Repeat lactate and blood cultures in 2 hours. Initiate airborne isolation precautions immediately due to suspected respiratory infection.",
