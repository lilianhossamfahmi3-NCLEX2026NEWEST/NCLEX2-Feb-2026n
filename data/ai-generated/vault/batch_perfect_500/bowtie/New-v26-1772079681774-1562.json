Hypotension poses a more immediate threat to organ perfusion. \nElevated WBC (18,000/mm3) is indicative of infection, but it's not the MOST immediate threat compared to hypotension. Antibiotics are already initiated. \nUrine output of 30 mL in the past 2 hours, while concerning for decreased output, does not pose the same immediate threat as hypotension. Further assessment and interventions (e.g., fluid bolus) are needed but after addressing the hypotension.",
