        "correct": "Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane by raising the threshold potential, protecting the heart from the adverse effects of hyperkalemia. Insulin with glucose shifts potassium intracellularly, reducing serum potassium levels. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) binds to potassium in the GI tract, facilitating its removal from the body. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage any arrhythmias. Restricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Assessing deep tendon reflexes may be relevant in neurological assessments but is not the priority in this situation. Encouraging fluid intake may be contraindicated in patients with fluid overload or kidney failure.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to address hyperkalemia promptly can lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Some interventions are not immediate or are not the priority in the acute management of hyperkalemia. Dietary restrictions and fluid intake adjustments are important for long-term management of CKD but do not address the immediate threat posed by elevated potassium levels.",
