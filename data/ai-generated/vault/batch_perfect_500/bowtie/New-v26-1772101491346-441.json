    "correct": "Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Administering prescribed medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, or remove potassium from the body, respectively. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage any arrhythmias. Restricting dietary potassium intake is a long-term management strategy but not an immediate intervention for acute hyperkalemia. Assessing deep tendon reflexes is important but not the priority in this situation. Encouraging fluid intake is generally beneficial for kidney patients but may be contraindicated in patients with fluid overload or kidney failure.",
