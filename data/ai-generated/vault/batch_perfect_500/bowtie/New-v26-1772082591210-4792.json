    "correct": "Fluid restriction is crucial to prevent fluid overload in AKI due to the kidneys' reduced ability to excrete fluids. Monitoring potassium levels is essential because AKI can lead to hyperkalemia, which is life-threatening. Administering prescribed diuretics helps manage fluid overload and potentially stimulate urine output. Strict intake and output (I&O) monitoring allows for precise assessment of fluid balance and response to treatment.",
