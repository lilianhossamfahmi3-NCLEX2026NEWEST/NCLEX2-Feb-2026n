    "correct": "The patient is most likely experiencing Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with Hyperkalemia. The elevated potassium, BUN, and creatinine levels, combined with the patient's history, lethargy, bradycardia, and oliguria, strongly suggest AKI. The metabolic acidosis (low pH and HCO3) further supports this diagnosis. Immediate actions include administering calcium gluconate to stabilize the myocardium against the effects of hyperkalemia and initiating continuous cardiac monitoring to detect and manage arrhythmias. Anticipated actions include administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to bind potassium in the GI tract and preparing for possible hemodialysis to remove excess potassium and correct the metabolic acidosis.",

    "incorrect": "While Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can present with similar lab values, the acute onset of symptoms and the rapid deterioration suggest AKI as the more immediate concern. While addressing the underlying hypertension and diabetes is crucial, the immediate threat is the hyperkalemia-induced cardiac instability. Other interventions might be necessary later, but addressing the life-threatening electrolyte imbalance must take precedence. Prioritizing fluid boluses without addressing the hyperkalemia can lead to fluid overload and exacerbate the patient's condition. Lastly, while a renal ultrasound might be ordered eventually, it's not an immediate priority in the face of life-threatening hyperkalemia.",

At 03:50, EMS obtained the following vital signs: BP 80/50 mmHg, HR 45 bpm, RR 10 and shallow, SpO2 85% on room air. Upon arrival to the ICU at 04:00, the patient is lethargic and responds only to painful stimuli. Current vital signs: BP 78/48 mmHg, HR 42 bpm, RR 12 and shallow, SpO2 88% on 2L NC. He has a Foley catheter inserted by EMS, draining minimal dark amber urine. Lab results are pending. Significant findings include bradycardia, hypotension, and oliguria.
