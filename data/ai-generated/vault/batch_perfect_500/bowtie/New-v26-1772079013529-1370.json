        "correct": "AHF is characterized by fluid overload, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, edema, and elevated BNP. Hypovolemic shock results from inadequate circulating volume, presenting with hypotension and tachycardia, but typically without signs of fluid overload. In AHF, the heart's inability to effectively pump blood leads to fluid accumulation in the lungs and periphery. Hypovolemic shock, on the other hand, is marked by a critical reduction in blood volume, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Prompt recognition and differentiation are crucial for appropriate intervention.",

Failing to recognize the significance of S3 heart sound and JVD in AHF.
