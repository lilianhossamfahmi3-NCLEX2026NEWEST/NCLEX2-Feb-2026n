    "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is correct because COPD patients retain CO2 and high oxygen can decrease their respiratory drive. Elevate the head of the bed to high Fowler's position is correct because it promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Encourage the client to perform pursed-lip breathing is correct because it helps to slow the respiratory rate and increase exhalation. Assess lung sounds and respiratory effort is correct because it provides data to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect changes in the client's condition.",

    "incorrect": "Increase the client's oral fluid intake to 3 liters per day is incorrect because while hydration is important, excessive fluids can worsen dyspnea in COPD. Administer a sedative to reduce anxiety is incorrect because sedatives can depress the respiratory drive in COPD patients. Prepare the client for immediate intubation is incorrect because intubation is a last resort and other interventions should be tried first.",
