  "stem": "A 68-year-old male is admitted to the cardiac unit with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI). He reports chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. His vital signs are: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 90% on room air. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. The patient is diaphoretic and anxious. Based on the information provided, determine which actions are indicated, contraindicated, or irrelevant for this patient.",

    "correct": "Administering oxygen is indicated to improve oxygen saturation. Administering aspirin is indicated as it is an antiplatelet and helps prevent further clot formation. Administering nitroglycerin is indicated to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood flow. ECG monitoring is indicated to assess for changes in cardiac rhythm. Morphine is indicated for pain management and vasodilation. Elevating the head of the bed helps improve breathing. Monitoring vital signs is crucial to assess the patient's response to interventions.",
    "mnemonic": "MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin) - a common mnemonic for initial MI management.",
    "incorrect": "Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is contraindicated as it can worsen respiratory distress and increase cardiac workload. Withholding nitroglycerin is contraindicated as it helps alleviate chest pain and improve blood flow. Administering a beta-blocker without an order and in the presence of hypotension is contraindicated as it can further lower blood pressure. Initiating ambulation is contraindicated due to the patient's unstable condition. Encouraging deep breathing exercises is irrelevant in the acute phase of MI when the priority is to improve oxygenation and reduce cardiac workload. Providing a high-sodium meal is irrelevant and potentially harmful for a patient with cardiac issues.",
    "questionTrap": "The question traps are related to interventions that are either harmful or not immediately relevant in the acute phase of MI. For example, Trendelenburg position can worsen respiratory distress, and ambulation is not appropriate for an unstable patient.",
