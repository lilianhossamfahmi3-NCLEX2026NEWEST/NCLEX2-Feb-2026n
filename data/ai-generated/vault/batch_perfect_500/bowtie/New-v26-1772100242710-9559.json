    "correct": "The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate that the current levothyroxine dosage is inadequate. The nurse should anticipate an order to increase the levothyroxine dosage. Monitoring for signs of hyperthyroidism is crucial after any dosage adjustment. Educating the patient about the signs and symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is essential for self-management. Assessing medication adherence is important to rule out non-compliance as a cause of the elevated TSH. Consulting with the healthcare provider regarding the need for further diagnostic testing is also appropriate to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.",

Not monitoring for hyperthyroidism could lead to overlooking adverse effects of dosage adjustments. Not educating the patient about signs and symptoms of thyroid imbalances hinders self-management.
