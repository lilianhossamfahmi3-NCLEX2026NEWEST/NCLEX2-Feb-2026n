        "correct": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance, muscle cramps) and lab results (elevated TSH, low Free T4) indicate that the current levothyroxine dosage is inadequate. The nurse should anticipate an order to increase the levothyroxine dosage to achieve euthyroidism. Monitoring for signs of hyperthyroidism (tachycardia, anxiety, insomnia) is crucial after any dosage adjustment. Educating the patient about the signs and symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is essential for self-management and early detection of dosage-related issues. Assessing medication adherence is important to rule out non-compliance as a cause of the elevated TSH, although the patient reports adherence. Consulting with the healthcare provider regarding the need for further diagnostic testing is also appropriate to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, although the clinical picture strongly suggests inadequate levothyroxine dosage.\n\nclinicalPearls: Hypothyroidism symptoms can be subtle and easily overlooked. TSH and Free T4 levels are key indicators of thyroid function. Levothyroxine dosage adjustments should be made gradually and monitored closely.\nquestionTrap: Students may focus on individual symptoms without recognizing the overall pattern of hypothyroidism and the need for dosage adjustment.\nmnemonic: THINK: Thyroid Hormone Is Needed to Keep body functions working normally.",
        "incorrect": "Not increasing the levothyroxine dosage would leave the patient in a hypothyroid state, leading to continued and worsening symptoms. Not monitoring for hyperthyroidism could lead to overlooking adverse effects of dosage adjustments, such as tachycardia or anxiety. Not educating the patient about signs and symptoms of thyroid imbalances hinders self-management and delays prompt reporting of adverse effects. Not assessing medication adherence could lead to incorrect assumptions about the cause of the elevated TSH, potentially delaying appropriate intervention. Not consulting with the healthcare provider could delay necessary diagnostic testing and optimization of the treatment plan.",
