  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Hypotension and decreased urine output are indicative of potential hypovolemia or decreased cardiac output post-CABG.  The elevated heart rate is a compensatory mechanism.  New onset chest pain requires immediate investigation for potential graft occlusion or other cardiac issues. Crackles indicate possible fluid overload and impaired gas exchange.",
    "incorrect": "While elevated WBC and glucose, edema, and coarse crackles are important findings requiring attention, they are not the MOST immediate threats to the patient's life. Elevated WBC could indicate infection, elevated glucose in a diabetic is common post-op, edema is expected after CABG, and coarse crackles may indicate fluid overload, but hypotension, decreased urine output and new onset chest pain are more concerning and require immediate intervention.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Following CABG, maintaining adequate blood pressure and urine output are critical for graft patency and renal perfusion.",
      "New onset chest pain in a post-CABG patient should always be treated as a potential cardiac event until proven otherwise.",

      "trap": "Focusing on the expected post-operative findings (e.g., mild edema, elevated glucose) can distract from the more critical signs of hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac ischemia.",
