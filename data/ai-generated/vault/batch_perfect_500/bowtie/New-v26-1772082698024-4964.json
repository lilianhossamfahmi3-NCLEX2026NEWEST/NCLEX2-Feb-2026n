Elevated WBC could indicate infection, elevated glucose in a diabetic is common post-op, edema is expected after CABG, and coarse crackles may indicate fluid overload, but hypotension, decreased urine output and new onset chest pain are more concerning and require immediate intervention. Administering analgesia, while important for pain management, does not address the immediate physiological threats. Notifying the provider is necessary but is a secondary action to immediate interventions. Preparing for intubation is not immediately indicated based on the provided findings.",
