His current medications include lisinopril 20mg daily, metformin 500mg twice daily, and furosemide 40mg daily. The physician orders an intravenous (IV) infusion of dobutamine at 5 mcg/kg/min to improve cardiac output. The pharmacy provides a dobutamine solution of 500 mg in 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. Mr. Jones weighs 200 lbs. Use the bowtie format to address the following aspects of Mr. Jones' care regarding the dobutamine infusion.",

The initial action should be to slow or stop the infusion. Calculating the correct infusion rate is essential for patient safety. The physician needs to be notified promptly about the patient's status change and the actions taken. Continuously monitoring the patient's vital signs is critical to assess the response to the changes in the infusion rate and other interventions. Lastly, documenting the patient's status, the interventions performed, and the patient's response is crucial for maintaining a clear and accurate record of care. An elevated potassium level should also be addressed but it is not the priority.",
