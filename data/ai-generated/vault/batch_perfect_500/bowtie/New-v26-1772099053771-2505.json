        "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is crucial in COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Assessing lung sounds helps determine the presence of wheezes, crackles, or diminished breath sounds, guiding further interventions. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps slow the respiratory rate and increase exhalation, improving gas exchange. Monitoring respiratory rate and effort provides essential data on the client's respiratory status and response to interventions.",

        "incorrect": "Administering a sedative is contraindicated as it can further depress the respiratory drive. Increasing the theophylline dose without checking serum levels can lead to toxicity. Performing chest physiotherapy is not indicated without assessing the client's tolerance and specific needs. Restricting fluids can thicken secretions, making them harder to expectorate. Placing the client in a supine position can worsen dyspnea.",
