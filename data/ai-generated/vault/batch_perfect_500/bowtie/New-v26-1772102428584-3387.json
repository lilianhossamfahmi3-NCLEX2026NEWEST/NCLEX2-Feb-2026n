She has been on this dose for the past 6 months. \n<b>Assessment:</b> At 09:00, the patient reports increased fatigue, weight gain (approximately 5 lbs in the last month), and constipation that has persisted for the last 3 weeks, despite adherence to her levothyroxine regimen. She also reports feeling cold all the time and experiencing muscle cramps, particularly in her legs. Vital signs are as follows: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 60 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min, Temp 97.0°F (36.1°C).\n<b>Recommendation:</b> I recommend checking her TSH, free T4 levels, and a complete metabolic panel to evaluate her current thyroid function and electrolyte balance. Consider adjusting her levothyroxine dosage based on lab results and symptom severity. Further evaluation for other potential causes of fatigue and constipation may be warranted if thyroid function is optimized and symptoms persist."
