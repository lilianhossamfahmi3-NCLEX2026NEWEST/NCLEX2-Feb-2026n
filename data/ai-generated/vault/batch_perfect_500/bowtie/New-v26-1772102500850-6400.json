        "correct": "A urine output of 10 mL/hr indicates inadequate kidney perfusion and potential organ damage due to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. The kidneys are highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and volume. Reduced urine output signals that the kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow to filter waste products effectively. This requires immediate intervention, such as fluid resuscitation and vasopressor adjustment, to improve renal perfusion and prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). clinicalPearl: Monitoring urine output is a key indicator of organ perfusion in critically ill patients. questionTrap: Other options are expected findings in sepsis, but low urine output indicates a critical problem with organ perfusion. Mnemonic: UO - Urine Output: Low UO = Low Organ Perfusion.",
        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated (tachycardia) but is a common compensatory mechanism in sepsis to maintain cardiac output in the face of vasodilation and hypotension. While it should be monitored, it is not the priority finding compared to critically low urine output. An oral temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) is consistent with the inflammatory response in sepsis. While antipyretics may be administered to manage fever, it is not the priority finding compared to critically low urine output. A white blood cell count of 15,000/mm³ is elevated (leukocytosis), indicating infection, which is expected in sepsis. While it should be monitored, it is not the priority finding compared to critically low urine output.",
