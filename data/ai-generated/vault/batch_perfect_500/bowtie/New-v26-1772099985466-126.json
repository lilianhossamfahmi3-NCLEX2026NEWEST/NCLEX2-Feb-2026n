        "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is correct because COPD patients often retain CO2, and excessive oxygen can diminish their respiratory drive, potentially leading to CO2 narcosis. Maintaining SpO2 in the 88-92% range provides adequate oxygenation without suppressing the drive to breathe. Elevating the head of the bed to high Fowler's position is correct because it facilitates lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm and promoting better air exchange. Encouraging the client to perform pursed-lip breathing is correct because it creates back pressure in the airways, preventing premature airway collapse during exhalation, which prolongs exhalation and reduces air trapping. Assessing lung sounds and respiratory effort is correct because it provides essential data to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect any changes in the client's respiratory status. Continuous monitoring helps in tailoring the care plan to the client's needs. ",
        "incorrect": "Administer a bronchodilator medication via nebulizer is incorrect because while it is an important intervention for COPD exacerbation, it is not the FIRST action to take when the client is acutely hypoxemic. Oxygenation takes priority. Increasing the client's oral fluid intake to 3 liters per day is incorrect because while hydration is important for mobilizing secretions, it is not the FIRST action in the presence of acute hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Encourage the client to cough and deep breathe every 2 hours is incorrect because while it may be needed to mobilize secretions, it is not the FIRST action. Addressing hypoxemia is the priority.",
