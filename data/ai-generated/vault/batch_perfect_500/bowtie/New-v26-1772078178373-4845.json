The goal is to provide adequate oxygenation while avoiding hypercapnia.\nAdministering bronchodilators via nebulizer will help to open the airways and improve airflow, reducing wheezing and shortness of breath. These medications relax the smooth muscles in the airways.\nEncouraging pursed-lip breathing will help to prolong exhalation and prevent airway collapse, improving gas exchange and reducing air trapping.\nAdministering antibiotics as prescribed will treat the underlying infection contributing to the exacerbation, reducing inflammation and sputum production.",
