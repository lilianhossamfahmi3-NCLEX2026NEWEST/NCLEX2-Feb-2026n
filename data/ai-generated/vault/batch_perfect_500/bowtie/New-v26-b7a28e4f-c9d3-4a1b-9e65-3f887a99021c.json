The patient expresses feelings of hopelessness and being overwhelmed due to financial strain and relationship issues. He verbalized, 'I just want the pain to stop.'\n\nB: Mr. Doe is a veteran with a history of anxiety but no prior psychiatric admissions. He reportedly took an unknown quantity of acetaminophen approximately four hours before arrival at the hospital. He denies any other substance use. \n\nA: The patient presents as anxious, tearful, and expresses significant hopelessness. Vital signs are currently stable: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air, and Temp 98.6°F (37°C). The primary concerns are a high suicide risk and potential acetaminophen toxicity.\n\nR: The immediate priorities are to initiate suicide precautions to ensure patient safety. Contact the attending provider for orders, including obtaining an acetaminophen level and scheduling an urgent psychiatric consultation. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial to detect any deterioration related to acetaminophen toxicity or escalating suicidal ideation. Provide ongoing emotional support and encourage the patient to express his feelings in a safe and therapeutic environment. Implement strategies to mitigate immediate suicide risk and address underlying psychological distress.",
