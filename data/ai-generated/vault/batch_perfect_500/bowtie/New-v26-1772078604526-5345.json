Interventions to manage fluid overload include administering diuretics (furosemide), restricting fluids, monitoring intake and output, monitoring daily weights, and providing supplemental oxygen.",

While monitoring potassium is important in AKI, it's not directly related to identifying fluid overload. Enalapril should be used with caution due to the AKI.
