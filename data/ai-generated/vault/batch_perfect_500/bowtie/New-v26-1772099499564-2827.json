This results in hypotension, tachycardia, and often, an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) as the body attempts to fight the infection. Lactic acid levels are also typically elevated due to tissue hypoperfusion.\n\nAdministering oxygen helps improve tissue oxygenation, counteracting the effects of hypoperfusion. IV fluids are essential to address the vasodilation and capillary leak, helping to restore blood pressure and improve organ perfusion.",

Bradycardia and decreased WBC are not typical findings in sepsis and would warrant further investigation for other underlying conditions. Hypertension is not typically associated with sepsis.\n\nAnalgesia is important for patient comfort but does not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis. While intubation may be necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, it is not the initial priority. Notifying the provider is important, but immediate interventions are needed to stabilize the patient.",
