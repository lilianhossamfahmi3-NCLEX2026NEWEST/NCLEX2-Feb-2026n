Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, while elevated lactate suggests anaerobic metabolism due to cellular hypoxia.

Addressing these critical parameters is essential to stabilize the patient and prevent further deterioration.",

Addressing hypotension and elevated lactate is paramount to preventing organ damage and death. The elevated WBC is concerning and supports the diagnosis of infection, but it does not require immediate intervention compared to the hemodynamic instability indicated by hypotension and the metabolic derangement indicated by elevated lactate. The nurse must prioritize interventions based on the severity and immediacy of the threat to the patient's life.",
