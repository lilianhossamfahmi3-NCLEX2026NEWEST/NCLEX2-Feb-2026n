Monitoring potassium levels is crucial because AKI can lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Holding lisinopril is important because ACE inhibitors can worsen AKI by reducing renal perfusion pressure. Restricting fluids helps prevent fluid overload, a common complication of AKI. Administering oxygen can help address hypoxemia, which may occur due to fluid overload or underlying respiratory issues. Starting IV fluids can help restore intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion, especially if dehydration is a contributing factor to AKI.",
