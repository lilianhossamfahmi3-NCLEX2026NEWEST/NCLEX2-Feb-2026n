        "correct": "A urine output of 10 mL/hr indicates inadequate kidney perfusion and potential acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Immediate intervention, such as increasing intravenous fluids or adjusting vasopressor support, is needed to improve renal perfusion and prevent further kidney damage. Sepsis causes systemic vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to decreased circulating volume and reduced organ perfusion. The kidneys are particularly vulnerable to this hypoperfusion, and a urine output of less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr is a critical indicator of renal dysfunction.",
        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated (tachycardia) but is a common compensatory response in sepsis to maintain cardiac output. While it requires monitoring, it is not the priority finding compared to critically low urine output. Temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) indicates fever, which is expected in sepsis due to the inflammatory response. While fever management is important, it is not the priority compared to critically low urine output. A white blood cell count of 15,000/µL is elevated (leukocytosis), indicating an infection. This is expected in sepsis, but the critically low urine output is more concerning.",
