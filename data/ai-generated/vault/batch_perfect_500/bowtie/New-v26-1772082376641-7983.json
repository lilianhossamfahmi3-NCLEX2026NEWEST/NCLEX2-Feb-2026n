    "correct": "Administer IV fluids: IV fluids help to improve renal perfusion and can help flush out toxins, especially in cases of AKI secondary to dehydration. Restrict potassium intake: Hyperkalemia is a common and dangerous complication of AKI. Restricting potassium intake helps to prevent or manage hyperkalemia. Monitor electrolyte levels: Electrolyte imbalances are common in AKI and can lead to serious complications. Frequent monitoring allows for timely intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Administer a loop diuretic: While diuretics may be used in some cases of AKI, they are contraindicated in the setting of hypovolemia. Consider administering a bolus of normal saline first before considering diuretics. Encourage high protein diet: Protein is broken down into nitrogenous waste products which will further exacerbate AKI. Provide sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate): While kayexalate can treat hyperkalemia, it is not the first line treatment and can have adverse effects. It should not be administered unless more conservative methods such as dietary potassium restriction, or IV calcium gluconate have been tried.",
