Restrict potassium intake: Hyperkalemia is a common and dangerous complication of AKI. Restricting potassium intake helps prevent or manage hyperkalemia, reducing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Monitor electrolyte levels: Electrolyte imbalances are common in AKI and can lead to serious complications. Frequent monitoring allows for timely intervention to prevent adverse outcomes.",

Administering a bolus of normal saline first is crucial before considering diuretics. Encourage high protein diet: Protein is broken down into nitrogenous waste products, exacerbating AKI. A low-protein diet reduces the workload on the kidneys. Provide sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate): While kayexalate can treat hyperkalemia, it is not the first-line treatment and can have adverse effects. Conservative methods such as dietary potassium restriction or IV calcium gluconate should be tried first.",
