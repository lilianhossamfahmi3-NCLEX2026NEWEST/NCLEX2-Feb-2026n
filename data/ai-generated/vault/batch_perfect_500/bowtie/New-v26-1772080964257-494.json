Hyperkalemia (potassium 6.1 mEq/L) is a result of decreased aldosterone, which impairs potassium excretion. This requires immediate treatment to prevent cardiac dysrhythmias. Hypoglycemia (glucose 70 mg/dL) is due to decreased glucocorticoid production and impaired gluconeogenesis, leading to insufficient glucose supply for the brain and other vital organs. All of these findings require immediate intervention to stabilize the client.",

The respiratory rate (24 breaths/min) is elevated, but the oxygen saturation is acceptable, indicating adequate gas exchange for now. Abdominal pain (4/10) is a symptom of Addisonian crisis, but addressing the life-threatening vital sign abnormalities takes priority. These findings should be addressed after the client is stabilized.",
