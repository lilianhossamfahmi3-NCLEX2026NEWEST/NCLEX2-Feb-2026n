She admits to stopping her hydrocortisone a week ago because she felt better. B: Diagnosed with Addison's disease 5 years ago. Normally compliant with medications. A: Suspecting Addisonian crisis. BP is 88/50, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. She is lethargic. R: I recommend immediate administration of IV fluids and hydrocortisone. We need to monitor her vital signs closely and check electrolyte levels.",

    "correct": "Hypotension is a hallmark sign of Addisonian crisis due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity leading to fluid and sodium loss. Hyperkalemia is a result of decreased aldosterone and requires immediate treatment to prevent cardiac dysrhythmias. Hypoglycemia is due to decreased glucocorticoid production and impaired gluconeogenesis.",
    "incorrect": "Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism for hypotension and while important to monitor, is not the highest priority. The respiratory rate is elevated, but the oxygen saturation is acceptable, indicating adequate gas exchange. Abdominal pain is a symptom of Addisonian crisis, but addressing the life-threatening vital sign abnormalities takes priority.",
