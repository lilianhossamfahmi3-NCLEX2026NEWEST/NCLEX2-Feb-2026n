    "correct": "Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is correct because COPD patients retain CO2 and high oxygen can decrease their respiratory drive. Elevate the head of the bed to high Fowler's position is correct because it promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Encourage the client to perform pursed-lip breathing is correct because it helps to slow the respiratory rate and keep airways open longer. Assess lung sounds and respiratory effort is correct because it provides information about the client's current respiratory status and response to interventions.",
    "mnemonic": "O-B-A-L: Oxygen, Breathing, Assessment, Liquids (later)",
    "incorrect": "Administer a bronchodilator medication via nebulizer is incorrect because while it may be needed, it is not the FIRST action. Increase the client's oral fluid intake to 3 liters per day is incorrect because while hydration is important, it is not the priority action for acute dyspnea. Prepare for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation is incorrect because it is a later step if other interventions are not effective.",
