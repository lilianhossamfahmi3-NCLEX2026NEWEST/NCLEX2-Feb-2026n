Obtaining a CT scan is essential to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, guiding further treatment. Monitoring vital signs closely helps to detect any changes in the patient's condition and allows for timely intervention. Elevating the head of the bed can help reduce intracranial pressure.\n\nclinicalPearl: Remember \"time is brain\" – every minute counts in stroke management. A CT scan is the priority to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as treatment differs significantly. IV access is needed for potential medication administration.\nquestionTrap: Students may be tempted to administer aspirin immediately, but this is contraindicated until a CT scan rules out hemorrhagic stroke.",
        "incorrect": "Administering aspirin without knowing the type of stroke can be harmful, especially in hemorrhagic stroke. Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated due to the risk of aspiration in patients with impaired swallowing. Waiting for further orders delays critical interventions in stroke management. Applying restraints is not indicated at this time and can cause agitation.\n\nclinicalPearl: Never administer aspirin to a suspected stroke patient before a CT scan is performed. Oral fluids are contraindicated until swallowing ability is assessed.\nquestionTrap: Students may choose interventions that are generally helpful but not the priority in acute stroke management, such as waiting for further orders.",
