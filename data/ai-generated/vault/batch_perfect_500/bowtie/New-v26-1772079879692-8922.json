    "correct": "Late decelerations in fetal heart rate indicate uteroplacental insufficiency and require immediate intervention to improve fetal oxygenation. Persistent elevated blood pressure (140/90 mmHg) can indicate preeclampsia and requires further assessment and potential intervention.",
    "incorrect": "A temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C) is slightly elevated but may be related to the labor process and dehydration. Requires monitoring, but not immediate action in the absence of other signs of infection. A fetal heart rate baseline of 140 bpm with moderate variability and occasional accelerations is within normal limits and reassuring. The client being GBS positive requires penicillin administration, but not until active labor is confirmed. Contractions every 5 minutes lasting 45-60 seconds is consistent with early labor and not an immediate concern. Cervical dilation of 3cm, 50% effaced, and -2 station also suggest early labor and not an immediate threat to the client or fetus.",

      "Late decelerations always warrant immediate intervention to improve fetal oxygenation.",

      "While GBS prophylaxis is essential, it is administered once active labor is confirmed to minimize unnecessary antibiotic exposure."
