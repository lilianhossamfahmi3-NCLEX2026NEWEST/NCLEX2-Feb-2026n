    "correct": "Oxygen administration improves myocardial oxygen supply. ECG monitoring allows for early detection of arrhythmias or re-infarction. Administering morphine reduces pain and anxiety, decreasing myocardial workload. Placing the patient on bed rest minimizes myocardial oxygen demand. Starting a clear liquid diet minimizes the risk of aspiration should the patient become nauseated or vomit. Assessing bowel sounds would rule out ileus related to the MI.",

    "incorrect": "Encouraging ambulation increases myocardial oxygen demand and may exacerbate ischemia. Administering a beta-blocker too soon post-MI without assessing contraindications (hypotension, bradycardia) can be detrimental. Initiating a high-sodium diet can worsen fluid retention. Providing large meals can increase myocardial workload.",
