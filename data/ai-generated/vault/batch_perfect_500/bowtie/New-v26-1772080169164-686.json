Obtaining blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration is essential to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (e.g., Normal Saline or Lactated Ringer's) is vital to address hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion.",

Monitoring urine output hourly is important, but not as critical as immediate interventions like antibiotics and fluid resuscitation in the initial hour. Initiating nutritional support is important for long-term care but is not a priority intervention within the first hour of sepsis management. It's important to focus on stabilizing the patient first.",
