    "correct": "Implementing suicide precautions ensures patient safety by minimizing access to harmful objects and providing continuous monitoring. Assessing the patient's coping mechanisms helps identify strengths and weaknesses in managing distress and tailor interventions. A psychiatric consult is crucial for comprehensive evaluation, differential diagnosis, and development of an individualized treatment plan. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common in veterans and can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, aligning with the patient's history and symptoms. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and impaired functioning, all of which are evident in the patient's presentation. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) can occur after a traumatic event and involves symptoms similar to PTSD but within a shorter timeframe (3 days to 1 month); given the recent deployment and symptom presentation, ASD should be considered in the differential diagnosis.",

    "incorrect": "Initiating group therapy may not be appropriate at this acute stage, as the patient requires individual attention, stabilization, and processing of trauma. Encouraging physical activity, while beneficial long-term, is not the immediate priority when addressing acute suicidal ideation. While substance abuse can exacerbate mental health issues, the patient's urine drug screen was negative, making Substance Use Disorder less likely as the primary diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms following deployment and the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes in the patient's history. Schizophrenia is unlikely given the lack of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and the presence of a clear triggering event (deployment). Adjustment disorder, while possible, is less likely given the severity of the suicidal ideation, the presence of flashbacks, and the significant functional impairment; PTSD, MDD, and ASD are more fitting diagnoses based on the clinical picture.",

    "sbar": "SGT David Miller, a 22-year-old male and active-duty soldier, was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit at 16:30. Situation: During a counseling session earlier today at 14:00, SGT Miller expressed suicidal ideation, stating, 'Sometimes I just don't want to be here anymore,' and feelings of profound hopelessness. He is struggling to adjust to civilian life after returning from a recent deployment. Background: SGT Miller's deployment involved exposure to combat situations. He reports experiencing frequent flashbacks, disturbing nightmares, and significant difficulty concentrating, all of which are impacting his daily functioning. He also describes feeling increasingly isolated from his family and friends. Assessment: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. However, he exhibits noticeable signs of anxiety and depression, including a blunted affect and tearfulness during the interview. His vital signs are as follows: HR 98 bpm, BP 140/90 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air, and Temp 99.1°F (37.3°C). Laboratory results, including a urine drug screen and blood alcohol level, were negative, and liver function tests were within normal limits. He denies current substance use. Recommendation: Initiate continuous suicide precautions to ensure patient safety. Consult with the psychiatric team for a comprehensive evaluation and to refine the treatment plan. Continue to monitor vital signs and assess for medication effectiveness and potential side effects from the newly prescribed Sertraline. Provide a structured, safe, and therapeutic environment to promote stabilization and engagement in treatment. Initiate individual therapy sessions to address underlying trauma and develop coping strategies.",
