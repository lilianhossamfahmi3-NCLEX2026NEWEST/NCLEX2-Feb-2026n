    "correct": "Managing a patient with sepsis requires a multifaceted approach focusing on early identification, source control, hemodynamic support, and antibiotic administration. The interventions selected directly address these priorities, including addressing the potential medication error related to the penicillin allergy. Addressing the source of infection and preventing its spread are crucial. Monitoring the patient's response to treatment and preventing complications are also vital. Rapid intervention and comprehensive care are essential to improve patient outcomes in sepsis. The administration of Zosyn, despite the patient's penicillin allergy, needs immediate attention.",

    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices often reflect a misunderstanding of the urgency and complexity of sepsis management or a failure to recognize the potential adverse effects of medications. Some actions may be appropriate in other contexts but are less critical in the acute phase of sepsis. Prioritizing less important tasks over critical interventions or failing to recognize the need for immediate action can lead to poorer patient outcomes. The incorrect options might address symptoms without addressing the underlying cause or could delay critical interventions. Ignoring the potential medication error related to the penicillin allergy could lead to serious harm.",
