They report increased wheezing, shortness of breath, and a non-productive cough that started this morning. The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min, heart rate is 120 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The nurse is reviewing the orders.

He has no known allergies. Parents report he has been exposed to seasonal allergens recently.\nAssessment: Respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min, heart rate is 120 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally. He is alert but anxious.\nRecommendation: I recommend administering a bronchodilator such as albuterol via nebulizer, supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 94%, and continuous monitoring of his respiratory status. Consider chest X-ray to rule out other causes.",

        "correct": "Bronchoconstriction, inflammation of the airways, and increased mucus production are all causes of asthma exacerbation. Administering albuterol via nebulizer helps to reverse bronchoconstriction. Administering oxygen via nasal cannula helps to increase oxygen saturation levels. Monitoring respiratory status frequently allows for early detection of changes in the patient's condition. Decreased wheezing, increased oxygen saturation, and decreased respiratory rate are expected outcomes of effective treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Allergic reaction and infection are potential causes of asthma exacerbation, but are not the primary causes in this scenario. Administering an antihistamine is not typically used in acute asthma exacerbations. Encouraging oral fluids may be difficult due to the child's respiratory distress and is not the priority. Placing the child in a supine position can worsen respiratory distress. Increased anxiety and decreased heart rate are not expected outcomes of treatment.",
