The priority is to reduce the infant's oxygen demand and increase systemic vascular resistance to shunt blood back to the lungs. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position decreases venous return from the legs, increasing systemic vascular resistance. Administering oxygen can help improve oxygen saturation, although it may not be fully effective due to the right-to-left shunting. Calming the infant reduces oxygen consumption. Morphine can help to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, promoting pulmonary blood flow. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can decrease heart rate and contractility, further reducing oxygen demand.",
