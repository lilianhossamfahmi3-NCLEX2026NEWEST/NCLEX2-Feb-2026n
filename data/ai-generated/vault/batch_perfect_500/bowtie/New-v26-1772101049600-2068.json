Dietary modifications, including limiting sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, are essential to slow the progression of CKD and manage symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments with a nephrologist are necessary to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment as needed. These actions help prevent complications and slow disease progression. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize the importance of adherence to medication and dietary recommendations to optimize outcomes in CKD patients.
