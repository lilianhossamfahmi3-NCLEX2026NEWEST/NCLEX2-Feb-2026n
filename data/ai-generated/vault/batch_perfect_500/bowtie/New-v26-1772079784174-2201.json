    "correct": "The child's presentation (fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, drooling, sitting upright, leaning forward, stridor) is highly suggestive of epiglottitis or another upper airway obstruction. Maintaining airway patency is the priority. Monitoring for increasing respiratory distress is crucial. Administering oxygen can help improve oxygen saturation. Notifying the provider immediately is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Preparing for intubation is a proactive step in case the child's airway becomes completely obstructed.",

    "incorrect": "Administering antibiotics (while potentially needed) is not the immediate priority; securing the airway comes first. Obtaining a throat culture and administering corticosteroids are not the initial steps in managing a potential airway obstruction; these actions can delay necessary interventions and potentially worsen the situation. Applying a cool compress is not relevant to the immediate management of a potential airway obstruction.",
