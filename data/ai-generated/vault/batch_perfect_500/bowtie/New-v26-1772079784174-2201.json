Maintaining airway patency is the FIRST priority to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Administering oxygen as needed helps improve oxygen saturation. Notifying the provider immediately is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment, including potential intubation. Preparing for intubation is a proactive step in case the child's airway becomes completely obstructed. Monitoring for increasing respiratory distress allows for timely intervention if the child's condition worsens.",

        "incorrect": "Administering antibiotics, while potentially needed to treat the underlying infection, is not the immediate priority; securing the airway comes first. Obtaining a throat culture and administering corticosteroids are not the initial steps in managing a potential airway obstruction; these actions can delay necessary interventions and potentially worsen the situation. Applying a cool compress is not relevant to the immediate management of a potential airway obstruction.",
