    "correct": "Prioritizing interventions in sepsis requires a rapid and systematic approach. Measuring serum lactate levels is crucial to assess the severity of sepsis and guide treatment. Obtaining blood cultures before administering antibiotics is essential for identifying the causative organism and determining antibiotic sensitivities. Administering a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, is indicated for patients with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion. The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and potential source of infection (UTI) strongly suggest sepsis. Given his history of chronic kidney disease and the lack of improvement after the initial fluid bolus, septic shock is a likely condition. Considering the patient's recent hospitalization and catheter use, multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) infection is also a possibility. Anticipated interventions include the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential pathogens while awaiting culture results. Monitoring urine output is crucial for assessing renal function and the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Finally, preparing for central line insertion is necessary for administering vasopressors and monitoring central venous pressure (CVP).",

    "incorrect": "Administering antipyretics alone will not address the underlying infection and hemodynamic instability. Ordering a chest x-ray is not the immediate priority in this scenario, as the primary concern is sepsis secondary to a UTI. Administering a second fluid bolus without assessing fluid responsiveness could lead to fluid overload, especially in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Hypovolemic shock is less likely given the fluid bolus already administered. Cardiogenic shock is less likely given the absence of specific cardiac symptoms. Hypoglycemia is not supported by the presented data and would require a blood glucose check. Initiating comfort measures alone does not address the life-threatening condition of sepsis. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis, as fluid resuscitation is a critical component of treatment. Administering a diuretic would worsen the patient's hypotension and is contraindicated in sepsis.",

    "sbar": "S: Mr. Jones is a 78-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU at 03:00 with altered mental status and suspected urinary tract infection. He presented from home after family reported increasing confusion. B: His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. He has an indwelling urinary catheter inserted at home due to urinary retention. In the emergency department, he received a 1-liter normal saline bolus. A: His current vital signs are: BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 91% on 2L nasal cannula, and temperature 38.9°C (102°F). Lab results show a WBC count of 18,000/µL, lactate level of 3.5 mmol/L, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL and BUN of 60mg/dL. His urine is cloudy and has a foul odor. The patient is currently confused and lethargic. Current orders include ceftriaxone 1 gram IV every 24 hours and IV fluids. R: I am highly concerned about sepsis, potentially leading to septic shock, and the possibility of a multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) infection given his indwelling catheter, recent hospitalization, and broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure. He requires immediate intervention to stabilize his blood pressure, address the presumed infection, and prevent further deterioration. The patient's condition remains unstable at 04:00 despite the initial fluid bolus. A central line might be necessary if hypotension persists.",
