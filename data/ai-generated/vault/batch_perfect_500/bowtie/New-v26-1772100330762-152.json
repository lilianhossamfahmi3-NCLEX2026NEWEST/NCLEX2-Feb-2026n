Ipratropium is an anticholinergic bronchodilator that can further reduce bronchospasm. Oxygen supplementation is essential to address hypoxemia. Monitoring respiratory effort is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Administering IV fluids at 1/2 maintenance rate is appropriate to prevent dehydration without overhydration, considering the child's respiratory distress.",
