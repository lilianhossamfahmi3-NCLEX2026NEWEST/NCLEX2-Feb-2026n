Measuring lactate levels helps assess tissue perfusion and guides resuscitation efforts. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first hour of sepsis recognition significantly improves survival rates. Initiating IV fluid resuscitation helps to restore intravascular volume and improve blood pressure in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and kidney function. Obtaining blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration helps identify the causative organism and guides antibiotic selection. Administering oxygen helps maintain adequate oxygen saturation.",

Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated in patients with altered mental status and hemodynamic instability. While a low-Fowler's position may be appropriate for some patients, it does not directly address the underlying sepsis and associated hypotension. Avoiding invasive procedures is incorrect as sepsis requires prompt interventions such as IV access, blood cultures, and possibly arterial line placement.",
