        "correct": "Massaging the uterus stimulates uterine contractions, helping to control bleeding by compressing the blood vessels at the placental site. Assisting the client to empty her bladder helps the uterus return to its normal position in the pelvis, allowing it to contract effectively. A full bladder can displace the uterus and prevent it from contracting properly. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential if bleeding persists despite initial interventions, as further medical management may be required. Administering oxygen is not indicated based on the client's current stable respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (assumed to be normal). Increasing the IV rate is not the initial action but may be necessary if bleeding continues and the client shows signs of hypovolemia. Documenting findings is important but should occur after implementing immediate interventions to address the client's unstable condition.",
