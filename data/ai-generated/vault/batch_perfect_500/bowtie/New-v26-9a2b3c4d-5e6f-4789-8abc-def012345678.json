Notifying the provider ensures the patient receives prompt psychiatric evaluation and medication management. Initiating suicide precautions, including removing potentially harmful items, further enhances patient safety. The most appropriate assessment is to conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment. Providing a calm and supportive environment helps de-escalate anxiety. Educating the patient about coping mechanisms equips them with strategies to manage future distress.",

While encouraging group activities is beneficial later, it's not the priority during acute suicidal ideation. Dismissing the patient's feelings or providing false reassurance is harmful and invalidating. Administering PRN medications without provider orders is inappropriate. Contacting the patient's family without consent violates patient confidentiality and can be detrimental. Leaving the patient unattended is a critical error in this situation. Focusing solely on discharge planning neglects immediate safety needs.",
