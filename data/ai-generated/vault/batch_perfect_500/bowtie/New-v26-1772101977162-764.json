    "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is crucial in COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to slow the respiratory rate and increase alveolar ventilation. Monitoring respiratory rate and effort provides essential data for assessing the client's respiratory status and response to interventions. Administering prescribed bronchodilators helps to open airways and improve airflow.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing theophylline dosage without checking levels can lead to toxicity. Encouraging deep breathing and coughing may be contraindicated if the client is already experiencing significant dyspnea and fatigue. Placing the client in a supine position can worsen dyspnea. Restricting fluids can thicken secretions and make them harder to expectorate. Withholding bronchodilators can worsen bronchospasm and dyspnea.",
