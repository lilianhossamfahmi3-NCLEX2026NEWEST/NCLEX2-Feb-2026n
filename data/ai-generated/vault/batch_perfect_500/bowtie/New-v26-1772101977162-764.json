He is alert but appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals wheezing and coarse crackles bilaterally. Vitals: HR 110, RR 28, BP 150/90, Temp 37.2°C.

        "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is crucial in COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive while ensuring adequate oxygenation. The target range is specific to COPD patients due to their chronic hypercapnia. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion, reducing the work of breathing. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to slow the respiratory rate, increase alveolar ventilation, and prevent airway collapse during exhalation. Monitoring respiratory rate and effort provides essential data for assessing the client's respiratory status and response to interventions. Administering prescribed bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) helps to open airways, reduce bronchospasm, and improve airflow. Theophylline is a bronchodilator but has a narrow therapeutic index, requiring careful monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing theophylline dosage without checking levels can lead to toxicity, such as arrhythmias and seizures, due to its narrow therapeutic index. Encouraging deep breathing and coughing may be contraindicated if the client is already experiencing significant dyspnea and fatigue, as it can increase the work of breathing and exacerbate symptoms. Controlled coughing techniques are preferred. Placing the client in a supine position can worsen dyspnea by increasing pressure on the diaphragm and reducing lung expansion. Restricting fluids can thicken secretions and make them harder to expectorate, impairing airway clearance. Hydration is important for thinning secretions. Withholding bronchodilators can worsen bronchospasm and dyspnea, leading to further respiratory compromise. These medications are essential for managing COPD exacerbations.",
