Notifying the healthcare provider promptly ensures timely medical evaluation and treatment. Preparing for thrombolytic therapy is crucial if the CT scan rules out hemorrhage, as it can dissolve the clot and restore blood flow. Continuous neurological monitoring allows for early detection of any deterioration or improvement in the patient's condition. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees helps reduce intracranial pressure. Obtaining a STAT CT scan is essential to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, guiding subsequent treatment decisions.\n\nclinicalPearl: \"Time is brain\" underscores the importance of rapid assessment and intervention in stroke management to improve patient outcomes.\nquestionTrap: Students might prioritize interventions that are part of routine care but not the most critical in the acute phase of stroke management.\nmnemonic: Use the mnemonic \"FAST\" (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) to quickly assess for stroke symptoms.",
