            "correct": "Administering oxygen via nasal cannula is essential to improve oxygen saturation levels and address hypoxemia caused by impaired gas exchange in the lungs due to bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) that acts as a bronchodilator, relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways, opening them up, and improving airflow. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that further helps to reduce bronchospasm by blocking muscarinic receptors in the airways, leading to bronchodilation. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways, decreasing swelling and mucus production, which contributes to improved breathing. The combination of these medications addresses the key components of asthma exacerbation: bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and impaired gas exchange.",
            "incorrect": "Withholding oxygen can lead to hypoxemia and further respiratory distress, which is dangerous for a child experiencing an asthma exacerbation. Normal saline nebulizer alone will not address the underlying bronchospasm and inflammation causing the respiratory distress. It may be used as an adjunct to help thin secretions but is not a primary treatment. Waiting to administer albuterol will delay relief of symptoms and prolong the exacerbation, potentially leading to worsening respiratory status. Antihistamines are not indicated for acute asthma exacerbations as they do not address the underlying bronchoconstriction and inflammation. They are used for allergic reactions, not asthma.",
            "clinicalPearls": [
                "Early intervention in asthma exacerbations is crucial to prevent respiratory failure. Monitor the child's response to treatment closely, including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and work of breathing.",
                "The combination of bronchodilators (albuterol, ipratropium) and corticosteroids (prednisolone) is the cornerstone of asthma exacerbation management.",
                "Always assess and document the patient's response to each intervention to guide further treatment decisions."

            "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly prioritize interventions based on familiarity rather than clinical necessity. For example, some may choose normal saline nebulizer before albuterol, not understanding the mechanism of action for each. Students may also confuse antihistamines with bronchodilators, leading them to select an incorrect option.",
            "mnemonic": "OAP: Oxygen, Albuterol, Prednisolone - the order of priority in asthma exacerbation management. Remember to address oxygenation first, then bronchodilation, and finally inflammation."
