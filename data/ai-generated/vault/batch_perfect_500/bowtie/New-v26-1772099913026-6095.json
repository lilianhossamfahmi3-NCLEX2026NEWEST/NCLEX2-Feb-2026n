Obtaining a CT scan is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, which dictates treatment decisions; thrombolytics are contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke. Administering oxygen maintains adequate oxygen saturation, supporting brain tissue perfusion and preventing secondary hypoxic injury. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 94%.",
        "incorrect": "Administering antihypertensive medication without knowing the type of stroke can be harmful. Lowering blood pressure too quickly in ischemic stroke can reduce perfusion to the penumbra, potentially worsening the infarct. Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated until swallowing ability is assessed by a speech therapist to prevent aspiration, which is a significant risk in stroke patients. Monitoring urine output is important for overall patient management but is not the priority in the acute phase of stroke management; the focus is on preserving brain tissue.",
