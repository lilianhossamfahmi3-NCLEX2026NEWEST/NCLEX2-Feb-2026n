Obtaining blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration is essential for identifying the causative organism and guiding antibiotic selection. Administering a bolus of crystalloid solution (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) helps to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. These actions address the underlying infection and hemodynamic instability.",

Waiting for further orders delays crucial interventions and can worsen the patient's prognosis, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.",
