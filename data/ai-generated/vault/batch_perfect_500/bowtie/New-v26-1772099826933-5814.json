        "correct": "Administering oxygen is crucial to improve oxygen saturation, aiming for >95%. Establishing IV access allows for rapid medication administration and fluid resuscitation if needed. Administering morphine helps manage pain, reduces cardiac workload by decreasing preload and afterload, and can alleviate anxiety. Elevating the head of the bed eases breathing by reducing venous return and pulmonary congestion. Notifying the healthcare provider ensures timely intervention and further management.",
        "incorrect": "Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is contraindicated in MI as it increases cardiac workload and venous return, potentially worsening pulmonary congestion. Encouraging ambulation is unsafe due to the patient's unstable condition and risk of further cardiac stress. Administering a beta-blocker without an order is inappropriate and potentially dangerous, as it can further reduce blood pressure and cardiac output in an already compromised patient. Waiting for lab results delays immediate interventions that can improve patient outcomes. Applying restraints is not indicated and can increase anxiety and cardiac workload.",
