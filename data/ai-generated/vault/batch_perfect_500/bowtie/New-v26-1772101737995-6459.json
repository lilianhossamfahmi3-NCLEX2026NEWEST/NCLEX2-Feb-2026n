    "correct": "Oxygen administration is crucial to improve hypoxemia. Titrating oxygen to maintain SpO2 88-92% is appropriate for COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Administering bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) helps to open the airways and improve airflow. Administering corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) reduces inflammation in the airways. Monitoring respiratory rate and effort helps to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing the oxygen flow rate above the prescribed range can lead to carbon dioxide retention in COPD patients. Withholding bronchodilators or corticosteroids can worsen the exacerbation. Delaying sputum culture and sensitivity can delay appropriate antibiotic treatment if an infection is present. Dehydration can thicken secretions, making them harder to clear.",
