    "correct": "Massaging the uterus helps to contract the uterine muscles and control bleeding. Assisting the client to empty her bladder helps the uterus return to midline. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential if bleeding persists despite interventions. Administering oxygen and increasing IV fluids are interventions for hypovolemia, which may be needed later if bleeding continues. Documenting findings is important, but not the priority action. Assessing vital signs is important, but the nurse already has recent vital signs.",
