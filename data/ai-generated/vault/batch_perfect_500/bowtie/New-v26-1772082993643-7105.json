Restricting potassium intake is important in hyperkalemia, which can occur due to impaired potassium excretion. Avoiding nephrotoxic medications prevents further kidney damage. Dialysis may be required if conservative measures fail to manage fluid overload, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis. Administering oxygen supports tissue perfusion in the setting of potential fluid overload and respiratory compromise. Starting IV fluids may be necessary to address dehydration, a common cause of AKI, but must be carefully managed to avoid fluid overload.",
