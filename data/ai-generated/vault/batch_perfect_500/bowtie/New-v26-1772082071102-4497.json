    "correct": "Elevated potassium (hyperkalemia) can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and requires immediate intervention such as administering calcium gluconate or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate). High blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) increases afterload and exacerbates heart failure, necessitating immediate treatment with antihypertensive medications. Oxygen saturation of 90% indicates hypoxemia and requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation, such as increasing oxygen delivery or considering non-invasive ventilation. Respiratory rate of 28 indicates tachypnea which could be indicative of worsening heart failure.",
    "incorrect": "BNP of 1500 is elevated, consistent with heart failure, but does not require immediate intervention as it is expected in ADHF. Crackles are indicative of pulmonary edema, a symptom of heart failure, but are addressed with diuretics and not considered an immediate life-threatening emergency in this context. Heart rate of 118 is elevated (tachycardia), which is expected given the patient's condition, but hyperkalemia and hypertension pose more immediate threat.",
