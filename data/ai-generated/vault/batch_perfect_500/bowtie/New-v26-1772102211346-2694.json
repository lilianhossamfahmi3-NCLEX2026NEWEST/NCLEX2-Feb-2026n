    "correct": "Administering a bronchodilator such as albuterol is a first-line treatment for asthma exacerbations to open the airways.

Administering corticosteroids helps reduce inflammation in the airways.",

    "incorrect": "Administering an antihistamine is not a primary treatment for asthma exacerbations; antihistamines are used for allergic reactions.

Restricting fluids is not indicated and may lead to dehydration.",
