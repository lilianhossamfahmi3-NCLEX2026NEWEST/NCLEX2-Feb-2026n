        "correct": "Administering a bronchodilator such as albuterol helps to open the airways and improve breathing by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to bronchodilation. Administering oxygen helps to increase the oxygen saturation by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, facilitating oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Monitoring respiratory status helps to assess the effectiveness of the interventions and detect any deterioration in the child's condition. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm and improving ventilation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a sedative can depress the respiratory drive and worsen the child's condition by reducing the patient's ability to maintain adequate ventilation. Placing the child in a supine position can restrict lung expansion by increasing pressure on the diaphragm and reducing lung volume. Withholding fluids can lead to dehydration and thickened secretions, making it harder to clear the airways. Waiting to administer medications can delay treatment and worsen the child's condition, potentially leading to respiratory failure.",
