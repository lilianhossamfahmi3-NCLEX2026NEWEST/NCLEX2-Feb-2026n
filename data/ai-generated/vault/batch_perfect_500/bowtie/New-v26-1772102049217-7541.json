    "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is essential to prevent hypoxemia while avoiding oxygen-induced hypercapnia. Assisting with effective coughing techniques helps clear secretions and improve ventilation. Positioning the client in high Fowler's promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to slow the respiratory rate and increase alveolar ventilation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a sedative can suppress the respiratory drive and worsen hypercapnia. Encouraging fluid restriction can thicken secretions, making them harder to expectorate. Performing chest percussion is contraindicated in COPD exacerbation as it can cause bronchospasm and further compromise breathing.",
