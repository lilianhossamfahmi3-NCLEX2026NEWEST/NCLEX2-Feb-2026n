An ECG provides critical information about the severity and impact of hyperkalemia on the heart. \n\nWithhold the lisinopril: Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that can worsen hyperkalemia by decreasing aldosterone production, which normally promotes potassium excretion. Given the patient's elevated potassium levels, administering lisinopril could exacerbate the hyperkalemia. \n\nReview the patient's urine output: Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatments aimed at reducing potassium levels and managing fluid balance. Decreased urine output can indicate worsening kidney function and reduced potassium excretion. \n\nConfirm the STAT furosemide order: Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes potassium excretion through the kidneys. Confirming the order ensures the correct medication and dosage are available and appropriate for addressing the hyperkalemia and fluid overload. \n\nAssess the patient's level of consciousness: Hyperkalemia can affect neurological function and lead to confusion or altered mental status.
