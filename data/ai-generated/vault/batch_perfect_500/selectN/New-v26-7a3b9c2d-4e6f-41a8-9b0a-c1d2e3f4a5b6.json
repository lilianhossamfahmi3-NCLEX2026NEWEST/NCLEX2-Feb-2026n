A: At 14:00, the patient reports feeling intensely overwhelmed, hopeless, and expresses 'There's no point in going on.' He is tearful and demonstrates noticeable psychomotor agitation. His vital signs are stable: BP 130/80, HR 92, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. Acetaminophen level is within the therapeutic range. R: I am requesting immediate orders for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and the implementation of ongoing suicide precautions. Please consider a PRN order for an anxiolytic medication to manage his current agitation.",
