GCS score is now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5) compared to 15 yesterday. Right-sided weakness persists. Pupils are now unequal, with the right pupil being dilated and sluggish to light. BP trending upwards: currently 180/100 mmHg. Heart rate is 55 bpm. RR 10 and shallow. O2 sat 92% on 2L NC. Physician notified at 06:15.
