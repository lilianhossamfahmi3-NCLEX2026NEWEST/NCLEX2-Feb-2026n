    "correct": "The client's elevated blood pressure (152/98 mmHg) warrants the administration of labetalol per standing order to prevent further complications associated with postpartum hypertension. Assessing for visual disturbances is crucial as it is a sign of worsening preeclampsia, which can occur postpartum. Monitoring intake and output is vital to assess for fluid retention or decreased kidney perfusion, both potential complications of preeclampsia. Assessing for clonus and deep tendon reflexes helps to monitor for central nervous system irritability, a sign of worsening preeclampsia. Notifying the healthcare provider is crucial to discuss further management of the elevated blood pressure and headache, as these may indicate a need for adjustments in treatment.",

She received magnesium sulfate during labor, discontinued 2 hours after delivery at 18:00. Assessment: At 20:00, BP is 152/98 mmHg, pulse 88 bpm, respirations 18, and temperature 99.0°F (37.2°C). Fundus is firm, at the umbilicus, and midline. Lochia rubra, moderate with small clots. Deep tendon reflexes are +2 bilaterally. Reports headache 4/10. Urinary output 150 mL in the last 4 hours. Recommendation: Continue to monitor BP closely. Assess for signs of postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia complications. Consider pain management for headache. Request order for antihypertensive if BP remains elevated.",
