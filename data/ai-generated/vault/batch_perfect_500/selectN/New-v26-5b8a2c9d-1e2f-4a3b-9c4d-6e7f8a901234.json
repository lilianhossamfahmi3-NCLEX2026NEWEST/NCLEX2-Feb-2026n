Decreasing the magnesium sulfate infusion could lead to seizures, which are a serious complication of preeclampsia.

She's complaining of a headache and blurred vision. Fundus is firm, 1 cm below the umbilicus, with moderate lochia rubra. She voided 200 mL at 14:00. Magnesium sulfate is infusing at 2 grams/hour. Deep tendon reflexes are +2. R: I'm concerned about potential worsening of her preeclampsia and the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. I recommend close monitoring of her BP, neurological status, and bleeding. Consider increasing the magnesium sulfate dose per protocol if indicated.
