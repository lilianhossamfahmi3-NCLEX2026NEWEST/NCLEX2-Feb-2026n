Notifying the mental health provider allows for expert assessment and adjustment of the treatment plan, including medication management and therapy options. Removing potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment minimizes the risk of self-harm by eliminating available means of suicide. Encouraging the patient to verbalize feelings provides an outlet for emotional distress and allows the nurse to assess the intensity and nature of the patient's suicidal ideation. Administering PRN lorazepam, as prescribed, addresses the patient's agitation and anxiety, reducing the immediate emotional distress that can contribute to suicidal thoughts. These actions prioritize the patient's safety and well-being during a critical period.",

Offering a snack and a warm beverage is a basic comfort measure but does not address the patient's underlying suicidal ideation or emotional distress. Contacting the patient's family can be a part of the overall care plan and provide long-term support, but it is not the most immediate action to take when the patient is at high risk for suicide. Providing a quiet and dimly lit environment may be helpful in reducing stimulation, but it does not directly address the patient's suicidal thoughts or ensure their safety. These actions are secondary to ensuring immediate safety.",
