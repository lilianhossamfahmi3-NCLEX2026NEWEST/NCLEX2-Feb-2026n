Removing potentially dangerous items from the patient's environment minimizes the risk of the patient using them for self-harm. Encouraging the patient to express their feelings can help identify triggers and coping mechanisms while building rapport and trust. Documenting the patient's mood, behavior, and statements provides a comprehensive record of the patient's mental state and helps to track changes over time.

Focusing solely on the physical symptoms of the overdose neglects the patient's underlying mental health needs, which are paramount in this situation. Administering PRN medications without assessing the patient's current mental state and consulting with the provider is inappropriate. While family support is important, involving them before assessing the patient's wishes and safety can be detrimental and potentially escalate the situation.

He initially presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and complaints of abdominal pain. B: Mr. Smith has a documented history of major depressive disorder but has been non-compliant with his prescribed medication regimen. He recently experienced job loss and a significant relationship breakup, contributing to his distress. A: The patient is currently alert and oriented to person, place, and time (x3). He expresses feelings of hopelessness, stating, \"I should have just died.\" While he denies current active suicidal ideation, he admits to experiencing passive suicidal thoughts. Acetaminophen levels are trending downward, indicating improving physical status. R: We will continue close monitoring of vital signs, mental status, and ongoing assessment of suicide risk. We need to consult with the psychiatry team for a comprehensive evaluation and recommendations. Suicide precautions have been initiated. Encourage the patient to verbalize his feelings and explore coping mechanisms. Consider medication management as prescribed by the psychiatry team. Repeat acetaminophen level at 04:00 to monitor progress.",
