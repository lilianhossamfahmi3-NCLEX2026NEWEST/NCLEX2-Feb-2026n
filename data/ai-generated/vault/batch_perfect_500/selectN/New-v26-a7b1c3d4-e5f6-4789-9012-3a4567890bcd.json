    "correct": "Administering furosemide intravenously will help reduce fluid overload by promoting diuresis, decreasing preload, and alleviating pulmonary congestion. Increasing oxygen delivery via a non-rebreather mask will improve oxygen saturation and alleviate hypoxemia due to pulmonary edema. Elevating the head of the bed to a high Fowler's position will promote lung expansion and decrease venous return, reducing dyspnea. Notifying the provider of the patient's hyperkalemia is essential, as it may require immediate medical intervention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Establishing continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial for detecting and managing potential arrhythmias associated with ADHF and hyperkalemia.",

Encouraging oral fluid intake would exacerbate fluid overload and worsen the patient's condition. Administering morphine sulfate is contraindicated due to its respiratory depressant effects, which could worsen the patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Assessing peripheral pulses every 4 hours is not an immediate priority; addressing respiratory distress and fluid overload takes precedence. Ambulation is contraindicated due to the patient's severe respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability; the patient requires rest and minimal exertion.",
