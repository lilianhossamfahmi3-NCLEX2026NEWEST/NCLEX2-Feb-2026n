He has a history of mild depression, managed with sertraline 50mg daily, but stopped taking it two months ago. A: On admission, Sergeant Miller is alert and oriented but tearful. He states, \"I don't see a way out.\" He denies current suicidal intent but admits to passive suicidal ideation. Vital signs are stable: BP 130/80, HR 90, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. He is cooperative but withdrawn. P: I recommend continuous observation, mental health consult, and resumption of sertraline. Need to evaluate the need for crisis intervention.",
