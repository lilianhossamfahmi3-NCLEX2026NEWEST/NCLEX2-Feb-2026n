        "correct": "Checking for Mr. Johnson's medication allergies is paramount before administering any medication to prevent potentially life-threatening adverse reactions, especially considering his documented penicillin allergy and the order for cefazolin, a cephalosporin antibiotic, which has a risk of cross-reactivity. Verifying the expiration date of the medication ensures its potency and safety; expired medications may be less effective or even harmful. Confirming the dosage with another nurse, especially for high-alert medications like cefazolin, is a crucial safety measure to prevent medication errors and potential harm to the patient. A second nurse can verify the dose is appropriate for the patient's weight and condition, reducing the risk of incorrect administration.",

In this case, addressing potential allergies and verifying dosages are more critical than adhering strictly to the 60-minute window.

He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed with oral medications. At 06:00, the patient reported a pain level of 2/10, described as a dull ache in his chest, which he attributes to coughing. The physician has ordered cefazolin 1 gram IVPB every 8 hours for the pneumonia, metoprolol 25mg PO BID for hypertension, and simvastatin 40mg PO daily for hyperlipidemia. The pharmacy sent cefazolin 1 gram/50 mL to be infused over 30 minutes. At 07:30, the nurse notes the cefazolin is scheduled to be administered at 08:00. The patient has a known allergy to penicillin, clearly documented in his chart under 'Allergies'. The cefazolin vial expiration date is 10/2027, as indicated on the vial label. Before administering, the nurse needs to ensure patient safety and prevent any adverse drug reactions, considering his allergy and current medications. The priority is to confirm the appropriateness of the cefazolin order given the penicillin allergy and verify all medication details.",
