Administering antihypertensive medications, such as hydralazine or labetalol, as prescribed, is essential to control blood pressure and prevent complications like stroke or eclampsia. Assessing for signs and symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage, such as excessive lochia, is vital because preeclampsia can increase the risk of coagulopathies and hemorrhage. Monitoring intake and output helps assess renal function and fluid balance, which can be affected by preeclampsia. Implementing seizure precautions is necessary, as the risk of eclampsia remains elevated in the postpartum period, even after magnesium sulfate is discontinued.",
