Administering supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask addresses the hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) more effectively than a nasal cannula. Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock as it increases preload and cardiac workload, potentially worsening pulmonary edema. Reducing preload with a diuretic like furosemide is beneficial to alleviate pulmonary congestion. Nitroglycerin can be used to reduce afterload, thereby decreasing the workload on the heart. Monitoring hourly urine output is essential to assess renal perfusion and the effectiveness of interventions.",

While morphine can alleviate chest pain, it can also cause hypotension and respiratory depression, which are detrimental in this situation.

While oxygen is needed, 2L via nasal cannula is insufficient given the patient's SpO2 of 88% and labored breathing.
