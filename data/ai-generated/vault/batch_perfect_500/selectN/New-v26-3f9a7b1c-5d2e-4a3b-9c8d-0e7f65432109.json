        "correct": "Administering IV fluids, such as Lactated Ringers, helps to correct the fluid volume deficit common in pancreatitis due to vomiting, third spacing, and NPO status. Monitoring serum electrolytes is crucial because pancreatitis can cause electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and hyponatremia due to fluid shifts and vomiting. Maintaining NPO status reduces pancreatic stimulation and allows the pancreas to rest, minimizing further inflammation and enzyme release. Providing pain medication as prescribed addresses the severe abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis, improving patient comfort and reducing stress on the body. Monitoring blood glucose levels is essential as pancreatitis can disrupt insulin production, leading to hyperglycemia. The elevated glucose level of 200 mg/dL warrants close monitoring.",

Administering a high-fat diet would further stimulate the pancreas, worsening the inflammation and pain. Ambulation may increase discomfort and is not a priority in the acute phase. Administering oral antibiotics is not a standard intervention unless there's evidence of a confirmed infection. While antibiotics may be indicated, this assessment doesn't reveal that. Administering a bolus of dextrose is contraindicated due to the patient's elevated glucose level of 200 mg/dL.",
