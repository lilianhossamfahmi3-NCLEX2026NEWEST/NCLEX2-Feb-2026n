NIPPV helps to reduce the work of breathing and improve gas exchange.\nElevate the head of the bed to promote venous return and reduce pulmonary congestion. This position uses gravity to decrease preload and ease breathing, reducing pulmonary edema and improving oxygenation.\nEstablish continuous cardiac monitoring to assess for arrhythmias or further ST-segment changes.
