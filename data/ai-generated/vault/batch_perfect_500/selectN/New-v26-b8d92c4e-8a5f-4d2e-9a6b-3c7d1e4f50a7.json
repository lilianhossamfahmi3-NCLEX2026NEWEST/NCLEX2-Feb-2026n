He missed his medications for the past 3 days due to a family emergency.\n\nA: Patient is currently in severe respiratory distress. Vital signs at 14:00: BP 170/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 32 breaths/min, SpO2 88% on room air. Crackles auscultated bilaterally. Labs show elevated BNP and troponin. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with ST-segment depression in leads V1-V4.\n\nR: I recommend immediate interventions to reduce preload and afterload, improve oxygenation, and prevent further cardiac damage. Consider IV diuretics, nitrates, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.",
