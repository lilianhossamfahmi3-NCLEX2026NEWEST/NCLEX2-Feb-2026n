        "correct": "Administer a vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine): The patient's low blood pressure (80/50 mmHg) indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, necessitating a vasopressor to increase systemic vascular resistance and improve blood pressure. \nIncrease oxygen delivery: The patient's SpO2 of 88% indicates hypoxemia. Increasing oxygen delivery via a non-rebreather mask or intubation if necessary will improve oxygen saturation. \nMonitor urine output hourly: Decreased urine output (15 mL/hr) suggests inadequate renal perfusion, a sign of shock. Hourly monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions. \nAssess hemodynamic parameters (CVP, PAWP): Mr. Jackson's PAWP of 24 mmHg indicates elevated preload, contributing to pulmonary congestion. Monitoring these parameters will guide fluid management. \nElevate the head of the bed: Elevating the head of the bed can help improve ventilation and reduce preload, easing the patient's labored breathing.",

        "incorrect": "Administer a fluid bolus: While hypotension is present, the elevated PAWP (24 mmHg) suggests the patient is already fluid overloaded. Administering more fluids could worsen pulmonary edema. \nAdminister furosemide: Furosemide may worsen hypovolemia and hypotension in the setting of cardiogenic shock. It might be considered later if fluid overload persists despite other interventions, but is not a priority at this time. \nEncourage ambulation: The patient is confused, hypotensive, and hypoxic, making ambulation unsafe and inappropriate. \nDecrease oxygen flow rate: The patient is hypoxic. Decreasing oxygen will further compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. \nAdminister morphine: While morphine can reduce anxiety and preload, it can also cause respiratory depression and hypotension, which are detrimental in this patient's condition. It should be used with extreme caution, if at all.",
