Urine output has decreased significantly over the past 12 hours. At 06:00 today, it was 30 mL/hr. A: Patient is currently alert and oriented, but increasingly restless. Vitals: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Current medications include IV antibiotics, insulin, and oral antihypertensives. Labs from 07:00 show K+ 6.8 mEq/L, BUN 65 mg/dL, Creatinine 3.8 mg/dL, and Glucose 250 mg/dL. EKG shows peaked T waves. Bicarbonate is 18 mEq/L. I am concerned about possible acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. I recommend immediate intervention to address the hyperkalemia and decreased urine output. Please evaluate and advise on further management.",
