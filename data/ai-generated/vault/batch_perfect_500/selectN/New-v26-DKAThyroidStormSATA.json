    "correct": "Administering a beta-blocker (e.g., Propranolol) is crucial to block the effects of excessive thyroid hormone on the heart, reducing heart rate and blood pressure. Administering IV fluids (0.9% NS) is essential to address dehydration resulting from HHS and to improve tissue perfusion. Initiating an insulin drip as per protocol addresses the hyperglycemia in HHS by facilitating glucose uptake into cells. Administering potassium chloride is essential due to the hypokalemia evidenced by the lab results, which can be exacerbated by insulin administration. Applying cooling blankets or ice packs is important to manage hyperthermia associated with thyroid storm.",

    "incorrect": "Administering dextrose is contraindicated as the patient is already hyperglycemic. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate due to the patient's altered mental status, increasing the risk of aspiration. Administering a thiazide diuretic is contraindicated due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances associated with HHS. Monitoring urine output every 4 hours is insufficient; hourly monitoring is needed to assess fluid resuscitation effectiveness. Administering oral antidiabetic medications is inappropriate in the acute setting of HHS; IV insulin is required.",

    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 72-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU at 06:00 from the Emergency Department. He presents with altered mental status, Kussmaul respirations, and signs of severe dehydration. He has a history of poorly managed type 2 diabetes and hyperthyroidism. B: The patient was found unresponsive at home by his family. His blood glucose was measured at >600 mg/dL in the field. A: Upon arrival, his vital signs are: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 140 bpm, RR 36 and deep, SpO2 92% on room air, and Temp 103.2°F (39.6°C). Laboratory results show elevated T3 and T4 levels. We suspect Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) complicated by possible thyroid storm. R: We have initiated 0.9% Normal Saline at 500 mL/hr and an insulin drip per protocol. We require orders for the management of possible thyroid storm, including beta-blockers and antithyroid medications, as well as further assessment of the patient’s mental status changes and continuous cardiac monitoring due to the elevated heart rate and potential for arrhythmias. Consider electrolyte repletion based on lab values.",
