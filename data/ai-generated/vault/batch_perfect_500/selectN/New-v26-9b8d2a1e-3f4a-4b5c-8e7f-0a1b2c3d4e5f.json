He completed a course of oral cephalexin for a UTI two weeks ago. O/A: At 07:00, patient is febrile (38.9°C/102°F), hypotensive (BP 88/50 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122 bpm), and tachypneic (RR 28). Urine culture pending. WBC is 18,000/uL with 15% bands. Lactate is 4.0 mmol/L. The patient is currently receiving 0.9% normal saline at 200 mL/hr. Assessment indicates septic shock. R: I recommend escalating antibiotic therapy, obtaining a repeat lactate level in two hours, and considering vasopressor support if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation. The patient requires close monitoring of vital signs and urine output.",
