Strict monitoring and management are crucial to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Administer pain medication as prescribed. Pancreatitis causes severe abdominal pain due to inflammation and pancreatic enzyme release. Providing adequate pain relief is essential for patient comfort and to reduce stress on the pancreas. Maintain NPO status. Keeping the patient NPO reduces pancreatic stimulation by limiting digestive enzyme release, allowing the pancreas to rest and heal. Monitor serum potassium levels. Hypokalemia can occur due to vomiting, nasogastric suctioning, and fluid shifts. Monitoring and correcting potassium levels are essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Provide oxygen therapy as needed. Pancreatitis can cause respiratory distress due to inflammation, fluid accumulation, and potential for ARDS. Oxygen therapy helps maintain adequate oxygenation.",
