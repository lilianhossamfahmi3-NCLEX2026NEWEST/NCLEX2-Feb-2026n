Administer pain medication as prescribed. Pancreatitis causes severe abdominal pain. Providing adequate pain relief is essential for patient comfort and to reduce stress on the pancreas. Maintain NPO status. Keeping the patient NPO reduces pancreatic stimulation and allows the pancreas to rest and heal. Monitor serum potassium levels. Hypokalemia can occur due to vomiting, nasogastric suctioning, and fluid shifts. Monitoring and correcting potassium levels are essential. Provide oxygen therapy as needed. Pancreatitis can cause respiratory distress due to inflammation and fluid accumulation. Oxygen therapy helps maintain adequate oxygenation.",

B: Patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and hypertension. He was admitted with elevated amylase and lipase levels. He may have been exposed to tuberculosis. A: Currently, patient is restless, guarding abdomen. Vital signs at 07:00: BP 150/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, Temp 38.2°C. Labs from 06:00 show amylase 1500 U/L, lipase 900 U/L, glucose 210 mg/dL, and WBC 14,000/mm3. Patient received morphine 4mg IV at 06:30 for pain. O: Continue monitoring vital signs, pain level, and glucose. Implement airborne precautions due to potential TB exposure. Patient education regarding alcohol cessation and low-fat diet is needed. Strict NPO status maintained. Consult with respiratory therapy for potential interventions related to oxygenation. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, given elevated WBC count.",
