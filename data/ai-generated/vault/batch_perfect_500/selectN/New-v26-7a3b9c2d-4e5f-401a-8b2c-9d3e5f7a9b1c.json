Administering regular insulin with D50W promotes the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid back into the cells, temporarily lowering serum potassium levels. Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating its excretion through the feces, thereby reducing serum potassium levels. Monitoring telemetry for changes allows for early detection and management of life-threatening dysrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Assessing the patient's muscle strength helps to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and identify potential complications of hyperkalemia. Holding lisinopril is appropriate because ACE inhibitors can exacerbate hyperkalemia by reducing aldosterone production, which normally promotes potassium excretion.",

While furosemide can help excrete potassium, its effectiveness is limited by the patient's impaired renal function.
