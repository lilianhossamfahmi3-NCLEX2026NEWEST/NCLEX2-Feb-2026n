Tachycardia (120 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism for decreased blood pressure and requires investigation to determine the underlying cause (e.g., hypovolemia, pain). Hypoxemia (SpO2 92% on 2L NC) suggests respiratory compromise, potentially due to fluid accumulation in the lungs or decreased respiratory effort from pain. This requires assessment of respiratory status and potential need for increased oxygen support. Low urine output (less than 30 mL/hr) indicates inadequate renal perfusion, possibly due to hypovolemia or renal dysfunction, requiring further assessment of fluid status and renal function.",

Leukocytosis (WBC 18,000/mm3) is an expected inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis and is not immediately life-threatening unless sepsis is suspected. The patient's report of dizziness upon sitting indicates orthostatic hypotension which correlates with the dehydration status indicated by the labs and is addressed by improving the patient's fluid volume.
