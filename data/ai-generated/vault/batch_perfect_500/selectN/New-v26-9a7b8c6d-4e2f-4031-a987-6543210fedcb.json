Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help manage the symptoms of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia and hypertension. Applying a cooling blanket is crucial for managing the hyperthermia associated with thyroid storm. Monitoring the patient's EKG is important due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with thyroid storm. Administering IV fluids helps to combat dehydration, which can be exacerbated by hypermetabolism and fever.",

Encouraging ambulation is inappropriate due to the patient's unstable vital signs and hypermetabolic state. Restricting fluids is contraindicated; the patient is likely dehydrated due to fever and increased metabolic rate. Administering insulin is not indicated unless hyperglycemia is present; the lab values show normal glucose levels.

Respiratory rate is elevated at 28, with shallow breaths. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. O2 support may be required. A: Physician was notified at 03:15 and verbal orders received. Orders include: IV fluids, cooling blanket, propranolol 1mg IV push, q5 min until HR < 120, then q4h. Propylthiouracil (PTU) 200mg PO q6h. Continuous EKG monitoring is initiated. Assess level of consciousness every hour. Airborne precautions initiated due to suspected respiratory infection. B: Patient is becoming increasingly agitated and her respiratory status is concerning. Continue to closely monitor vital signs and administer medications as ordered. Be prepared for potential intubation if respiratory status declines further. Consider transfer to a higher level of care if there is no improvement in her condition.",
