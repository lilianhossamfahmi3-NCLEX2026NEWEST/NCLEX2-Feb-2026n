Administering intravenous fluids helps to correct fluid volume deficit caused by vomiting, third spacing, and decreased oral intake. Monitoring serum electrolytes is crucial because pancreatitis can lead to electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Assessing pain level and effectiveness of pain medication is essential for patient comfort and to evaluate the effectiveness of the prescribed analgesics.

Ambulation, while generally beneficial, is not a priority in the acute phase of pancreatitis due to the patient's pain and hemodynamic instability. Encouraging a high-fat diet would exacerbate the pancreatitis by stimulating pancreatic enzyme secretion. Initiating enteral feedings is contraindicated in the acute phase as it can further stimulate pancreatic secretions. Administering anti-diarrheal medications is not indicated as diarrhea is not a primary symptom of acute pancreatitis; constipation is more common due to decreased oral intake and opioid use.",

Blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Patient is currently NPO. Administered morphine 4mg IV for pain at 04:00 with minimal relief. Abdominal assessment reveals guarding and tenderness to palpation. Amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated. Patient is at risk for fluid volume deficit and electrolyte imbalances. Call provider if pain is uncontrolled or vital signs worsen. Anticipate orders for IV fluids and electrolyte replacement. Ensure strict NPO status maintained. Monitor for complications such as ARDS.",
