        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering prescribed mannitol helps reduce ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Maintaining a neutral head position prevents jugular vein compression, facilitating venous drainage and reducing ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes indicating worsening ICP or complications.",

He received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within three hours of symptom onset. A: At 07:00 today, Mr. Smith's GCS is 11 (E3, V3, M5). He exhibits right-sided weakness. His pupils are equal and reactive to light, although sluggish. His blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, heart rate is 92 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 and labored, and SpO2 is 94% on 2L nasal cannula. ICP monitoring shows a current reading of 22 mmHg. The patient denies any headache at this time. R: I recommend notifying the provider immediately regarding the increased ICP. We need to continue neurological assessments every hour to monitor for any changes. I will elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage. Strict monitoring of intake and output is crucial. I will administer prescribed medications as ordered, including mannitol for increased ICP and labetalol for hypertension. We also need to monitor closely for any seizure activity and implement seizure precautions. Consider the need for further imaging or interventions based on the provider's assessment.",
