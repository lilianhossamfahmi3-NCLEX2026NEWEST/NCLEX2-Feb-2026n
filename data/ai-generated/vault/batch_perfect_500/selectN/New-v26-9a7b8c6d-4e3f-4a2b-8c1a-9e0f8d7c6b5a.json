Obtaining blood cultures is essential to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly is vital in treating sepsis and preventing further deterioration. Continuing fluid resuscitation is important to optimize preload and improve cardiac output, but it should be done cautiously while monitoring for fluid overload. Monitoring urine output closely is essential to assess renal perfusion and guide fluid management.",

Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can impair respiratory function and does not improve cardiac output or tissue perfusion. Decreasing the oxygen flow rate is inappropriate, given the patient's oxygen saturation of 92% and increased respiratory rate, which indicate respiratory distress.",

O: At 07:30, his BP is 80/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. He is lethargic but arousable to voice. Urine output is 15 mL/hr. Temp is 102.5°F (39.2°C). Labs are pending but initial lactate was elevated at 4.0 mmol/L. I: I'm concerned about worsening septic shock.
