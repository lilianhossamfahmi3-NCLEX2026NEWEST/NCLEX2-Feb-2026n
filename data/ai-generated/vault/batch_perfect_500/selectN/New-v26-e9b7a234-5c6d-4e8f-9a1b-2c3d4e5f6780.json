He is currently prescribed furosemide 40 mg IV BID, lisinopril 20 mg PO daily, metformin 500 mg PO BID, and atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily. The provider has ordered potassium chloride 20 mEq PO daily, based on morning lab results indicating hypokalemia. It is now 08:00. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.
