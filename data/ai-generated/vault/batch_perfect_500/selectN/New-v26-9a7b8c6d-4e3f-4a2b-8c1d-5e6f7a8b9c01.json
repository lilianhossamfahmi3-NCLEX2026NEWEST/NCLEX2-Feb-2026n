    "correct": "Monitoring blood pressure closely is crucial in the postpartum period for clients with preeclampsia, as it can remain elevated or even worsen in the days following delivery. Assessing for signs of postpartum hemorrhage is vital, as preeclampsia can increase the risk of uterine atony and bleeding due to impaired coagulation. Administering labetalol as prescribed for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 160 mmHg is important to prevent complications such as stroke or seizures. Restricting fluids is generally not recommended unless there are signs of fluid overload; preeclamptic patients need adequate hydration. Assessing for signs of magnesium toxicity is no longer indicated, as the magnesium sulfate infusion has been discontinued.",

Assessing lochia is important, but monitoring for signs of postpartum hemorrhage includes assessing fundal tone and vital signs, making it less critical as a standalone intervention. Restricting fluids is not typically indicated unless there are specific signs of fluid overload. While patient comfort is important, administering acetaminophen for headache is less critical than managing blood pressure and monitoring for postpartum hemorrhage. Since the magnesium sulfate has been discontinued, assessment for toxicity is no longer a priority.",

Fundus firm and at the umbilicus. R: Continue monitoring vital signs, assess for signs of postpartum hemorrhage, and manage blood pressure as ordered. Notify provider for any significant changes.
