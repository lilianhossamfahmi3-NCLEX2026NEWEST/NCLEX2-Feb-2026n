    "correct": "The patient's aPTT is significantly elevated (92 seconds, normal 25-35 seconds), indicating excessive anticoagulation and an increased risk of bleeding. Reducing or holding the heparin infusion is crucial to prevent further complications. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for heparin and should be readily available. Monitoring for signs of bleeding (gums, urine, stool) is essential. Repeating the aPTT in one hour is appropriate to assess the effect of the dose reduction or hold.",

    "incorrect": "Continuing the heparin infusion at the same rate is dangerous due to the elevated aPTT and nosebleed, increasing the risk of a serious hemorrhagic event. Administering a heparin bolus would further elevate the aPTT and exacerbate the bleeding risk. Increasing the heparin infusion rate would dangerously increase the anticoagulation, increasing bleeding risks. Delaying the aPTT would delay necessary treatment adjustments.",

The 07:00 aPTT result is 92 seconds, significantly above the therapeutic range. B: Heparin infusion is running per protocol. At 07:30, the patient reported a mild nosebleed. There are no current orders for airborne isolation. A: I am concerned about possible heparin-induced bleeding due to the elevated aPTT and recent nosebleed. Vital signs are currently stable: BP 138/82, HR 78, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. The current heparin infusion rate is 1400 units/hour. The last heparin bolus was administered 2 hours ago. The patient denies any new pain or neurological deficits. I have already notified the attending physician. I recommend holding the heparin and rechecking the aPTT. Please review the orders and advise on further management.",
