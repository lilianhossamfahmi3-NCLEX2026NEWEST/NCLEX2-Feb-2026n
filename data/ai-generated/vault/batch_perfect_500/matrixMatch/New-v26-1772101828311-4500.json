She denies any contractions or abdominal pain. Her prenatal care has been unremarkable, and she has no known allergies.\n<b>Assessment:</b> On examination at 08:15, the nurse notes the uterus is soft and non-tender upon palpation. The fetal heart rate is 140 bpm, as auscultated via Doppler. There is moderate vaginal bleeding observed. The client's vital signs are stable: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F (37°C).\n<b>Recommendation:</b> I recommend continuous fetal monitoring, assessment of blood loss, and evaluation for possible placenta previa or abruptio placentae. We should prepare for a possible ultrasound to determine placental location and consider blood type and screen. The physician has been notified."

        "correct": "Placenta previa is characterized by painless vaginal bleeding, a soft, non-tender uterus, and a fetal heart rate that is usually within normal limits. Abruptio placentae typically presents with painful vaginal bleeding, a firm, tender uterus, and possible fetal distress. In placenta previa, the placenta implants over or near the cervical os, leading to bleeding as the cervix dilates. Abruptio placentae involves premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, causing pain and potential fetal compromise. The absence of abdominal pain and uterine tenderness points away from abruptio placentae.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the differentiating signs and symptoms of placenta previa and abruptio placentae. Review the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of each condition. Consider that placenta previa typically presents with painless bleeding, while abruptio placentae is often associated with pain. Also, consider the impact of each condition on uterine tone and fetal well-being.",

            "Painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester is a classic sign of placenta previa. Always assess placental location via ultrasound before performing a vaginal exam in a patient with third-trimester bleeding.",
            "Abdominal pain and uterine tenderness are more indicative of abruptio placentae. However, absence of pain does not rule out abruption.",
            "Fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial in both conditions to assess fetal well-being. Changes in fetal heart rate can indicate fetal distress."
