Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, and decreased urine output suggests kidney dysfunction, both of which can lead to irreversible organ damage if not addressed promptly.",
        "incorrect": "While elevated heart rate (120 bpm), elevated white blood cell count (15,000/µL), and elevated temperature (38.9°C) are indicators of sepsis, hypotension (Systolic BP 80 mmHg) and decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) indicate a more critical stage of the disease process requiring immediate intervention. Elevated heart rate and temperature are common compensatory mechanisms, and an elevated WBC count suggests infection, but they do not directly reflect organ dysfunction to the same extent as hypotension and oliguria.",
