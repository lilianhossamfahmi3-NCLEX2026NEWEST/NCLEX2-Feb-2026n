        "correct": "Improvement: SpO2 >95% indicates improved oxygenation, suggesting the respiratory support is effective. Decreased wheezing indicates improved airflow as the airways are less constricted. Decreased respiratory rate indicates decreased work of breathing, suggesting the medication is helping to relax the airway muscles. No Change: HR 130 bpm is still elevated but within acceptable range given the patient's condition and albuterol administration, indicating no significant change from the expected response to treatment. Alert and Anxious indicates the patient's anxiety levels are consistent, possibly due to the asthma exacerbation itself, indicating no change in mental status. Worsening: PaCO2 50 mmHg indicates worsening respiratory acidosis, suggesting the patient is not effectively ventilating. Increased Intercostal Retractions indicates increasing work of breathing as the patient struggles to inhale. Diminished breath sounds in the bases indicates worsening airflow and potential air trapping in the lower airways.",

For example, assuming a slightly elevated heart rate is a sign of worsening when it's expected with albuterol use. Failing to recognize the significance of elevated PaCO2 or increased retractions also indicates a lack of understanding of respiratory distress. Students might also focus on a single data point rather than considering the overall clinical picture.",
