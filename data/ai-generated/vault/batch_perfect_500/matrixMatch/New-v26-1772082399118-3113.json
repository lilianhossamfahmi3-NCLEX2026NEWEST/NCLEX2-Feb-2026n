    "correct": "Improvement: SpO2 >95% indicates improved oxygenation; Decreased wheezing indicates improved airflow; Decreased respiratory rate indicates decreased work of breathing. No Change: HR 130 bpm is still elevated but within acceptable range given the patient's condition, indicating no significant change; Alert and Anxious indicates the patient's anxiety levels are consistent, indicating no change. Worsening: PaCO2 50 mmHg indicates worsening respiratory acidosis; Increased Intercostal Retractions indicates increasing work of breathing; Diminished breath sounds in the bases indicates worsening airflow and potential air trapping.",

For example, assuming a slightly elevated heart rate is a sign of worsening when it's expected with albuterol use.
