        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed helps to lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling in the lower extremities. Assessing for bowel impaction is crucial as it is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Administering antihypertensive medication (hydralazine) as prescribed is essential to lower the dangerously high blood pressure. Removing constrictive clothing can help improve circulation and reduce external pressure. Checking for bladder distension, even with a patent catheter, is important as the catheter may not be draining effectively due to kinks, sediment, or bladder spasms.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker is contraindicated as it can worsen bradycardia, which is already present due to the autonomic dysreflexia. Lowering the head of the bed would increase blood pressure further, exacerbating the hypertensive crisis. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position would significantly increase blood pressure and is absolutely contraindicated. Encouraging deep breathing exercises is not the priority in this acute situation as it does not directly address the hypertension. Massaging the legs is contraindicated as it could potentially dislodge a clot and increase venous return, further raising blood pressure.",
