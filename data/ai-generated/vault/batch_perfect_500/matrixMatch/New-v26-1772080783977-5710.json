Elevated heart rate is consistent with compensation. The body attempts to maintain cardiac output by increasing the heart rate. Increased blood pressure can be a compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion to vital organs.",

        "incorrect": "Normal labs such as potassium and sodium, along with a normal temperature, do not contribute to heart failure exacerbation. While elevated creatinine would need to be addressed, it is not the most indicative data point for heart failure exacerbation. Elevated creatinine can indicate kidney dysfunction, which can be a comorbidity but not a primary indicator of acute heart failure.",
