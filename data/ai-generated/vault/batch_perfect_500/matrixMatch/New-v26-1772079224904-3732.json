        "correct": "HFrEF is typically characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (usually ≤ 40%) due to impaired contractility. HFpEF is characterized by a normal or preserved ejection fraction (usually ≥ 50%) but with impaired diastolic function. Distinguishing between the two is crucial for guiding treatment. Elevated BNP can occur in both due to ventricular wall stress. An S3 gallop is associated with increased ventricular filling pressures, common in HFrEF. Hypertension is a risk factor for both HFrEF and HFpEF.",
