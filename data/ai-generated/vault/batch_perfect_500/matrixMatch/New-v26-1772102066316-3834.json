        "correct": "The elevated TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and low Free T4 (Thyroxine) levels indicate that the patient's hypothyroidism is not adequately controlled with the current levothyroxine dosage. TSH is high because the pituitary gland is attempting to stimulate the thyroid to produce more T4. Free T4 is the active form of the hormone. This requires immediate action to adjust the medication dosage to prevent further complications such as myxedema coma, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe metabolic slowing. The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation) are consistent with hypothyroidism but do not require immediate escalation as long as the thyroid hormone levels are addressed. The goal is to restore euthyroidism (normal thyroid function).",
        "incorrect": "While fatigue, weight gain, constipation are symptoms of hypothyroidism, they do not individually represent an immediate threat to the patient's life. The priority is to address the underlying hormonal imbalance indicated by the abnormal lab values. Normal vital signs indicate no immediate crisis, but the abnormal TSH and Free T4 levels necessitate immediate intervention to prevent further decompensation. Failing to address the lab abnormalities could lead to severe complications.",

            "Levothyroxine dosage adjustments should be based on lab results and patient symptoms. The typical starting dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day, but adjustments are made based on TSH levels.",
