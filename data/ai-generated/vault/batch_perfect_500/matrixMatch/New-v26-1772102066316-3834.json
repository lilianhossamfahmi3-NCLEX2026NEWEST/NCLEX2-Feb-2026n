    "correct": "The elevated TSH and low Free T4 levels indicate that the patient's hypothyroidism is not adequately controlled with the current levothyroxine dosage. This requires immediate action to adjust the medication dosage to prevent further complications such as myxedema coma. The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation) are consistent with hypothyroidism but do not require immediate escalation as long as the thyroid hormone levels are addressed.",
    "incorrect": "While fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, delayed reflexes, and depression are all symptoms of hypothyroidism, they do not individually represent an immediate threat to the patient's life. The priority is to address the underlying hormonal imbalance indicated by the abnormal lab values. Normal vital signs indicate no immediate crisis.",
