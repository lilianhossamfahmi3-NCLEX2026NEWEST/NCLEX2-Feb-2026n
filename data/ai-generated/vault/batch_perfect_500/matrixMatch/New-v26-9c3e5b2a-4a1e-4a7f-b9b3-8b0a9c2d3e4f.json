        "correct": "Administering a vasopressor (norepinephrine) is indicated to increase blood pressure in the setting of septic shock by constricting blood vessels and improving cardiac output. Obtaining blood cultures before starting antibiotics helps identify the specific organism causing the infection, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically is crucial in sepsis management to cover potential pathogens before culture results are available, improving the chances of survival. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is vital for assessing the client's response to interventions, detecting any deterioration, and guiding further treatment. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess kidney function and fluid balance in the context of sepsis-induced kidney injury; decreased urine output may indicate inadequate perfusion or acute kidney injury.\n\nclinicalPearl: Early goal-directed therapy in sepsis focuses on optimizing blood pressure and tissue perfusion to prevent organ damage.",

        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen alone is insufficient to address the underlying cause of sepsis, which involves infection and hemodynamic instability. While acetaminophen may temporarily reduce fever, it does not treat the infection or hypotension. Delaying antibiotic administration increases the risk of mortality in sepsis. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible after obtaining cultures to combat the infection. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis, as adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Placing the client in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can worsen respiratory distress and does not effectively improve cardiac output.\n\nquestionTrap: Nurses may focus on fever management with acetaminophen, overlooking the critical need for antibiotics and fluid resuscitation to address the underlying sepsis.",
