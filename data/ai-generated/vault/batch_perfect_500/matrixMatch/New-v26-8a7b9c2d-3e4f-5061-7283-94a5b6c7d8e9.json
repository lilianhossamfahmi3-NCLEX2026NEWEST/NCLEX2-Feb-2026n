    "correct": "Removing the noxious stimuli resolves the precipitating cause of autonomic dysreflexia, thereby reducing the exaggerated sympathetic response and lowering blood pressure. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous pooling, reducing venous return and subsequently decreasing blood pressure. Administering antihypertensive medication directly addresses the elevated blood pressure, mitigating the risk of complications such as stroke or seizure. Monitoring blood pressure frequently allows for timely assessment of the effectiveness of interventions and guides further management decisions.",

    "incorrect": "Administering oxygen may be appropriate if hypoxemia is present, but it does not directly address the underlying cause or the elevated blood pressure in autonomic dysreflexia. Increasing IV fluids can exacerbate hypertension in this condition. Applying restraints is contraindicated as it can increase agitation and potentially worsen the autonomic response. Initiating a bladder training program is not an immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia and is a long-term rehabilitation goal.",

He has been managing his bowel and bladder regimen at home with assistance. At 08:00 today, patient reported a throbbing headache and feeling flushed. A: At 08:15, assessment revealed BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, nasal congestion, and diaphoresis above the level of injury. Patient reports feeling anxious. I&O catheter is in place and draining clear urine. Bowel movement was last noted two days ago. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Skin intact except for expected pressure points. R: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I recommend checking the urinary catheter for kinks, assessing for bowel impaction, and administering PRN nifedipine 10 mg SL for BP control. Monitor BP every 5 minutes and notify provider if BP remains elevated after 15 minutes.",
