        "correct": "Albuterol, a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, causes bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, thereby reducing airway resistance and improving airflow. Administering oxygen is crucial to counteract hypoxemia resulting from impaired gas exchange due to bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium, an anticholinergic, further aids bronchodilation by blocking muscarinic receptors in the airways, reducing mucus production and airway constriction. These interventions rapidly improve respiratory function during an acute asthma exacerbation.",
        "incorrect": "While oxygen is essential to address hypoxemia, it does not directly treat the underlying bronchoconstriction. Albuterol and ipratropium are the primary bronchodilators needed. Antibiotics are not indicated in an asthma exacerbation unless there is evidence of a bacterial infection, which is not indicated in the scenario. Delaying albuterol and ipratropium can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.",
