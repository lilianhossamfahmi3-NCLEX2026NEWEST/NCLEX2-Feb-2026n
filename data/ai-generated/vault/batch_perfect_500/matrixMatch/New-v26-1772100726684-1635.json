Bradycardia is a common cardiovascular manifestation resulting from the slowed metabolic processes. Dry skin is an integumentary finding associated with decreased thyroid hormone levels, leading to reduced sebum production and moisture retention. \n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are crucial to prevent complications such as myxedema coma and cardiovascular issues.",

Warm, moist skin is not typically associated with hypothyroidism; instead, dry skin is a hallmark sign. \n\nquestionTrap: The question trap lies in confusing the symptoms of hypothyroidism with those of hyperthyroidism. Students must carefully differentiate between the two conditions based on the patient's specific presentation.",
