        "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is appropriate for COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive, which is their primary stimulus for breathing. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to prolong exhalation, prevent air trapping, and reduce dyspnea by creating back pressure in the airways. Positioning the client in high Fowler's promotes optimal lung expansion and diaphragmatic descent, improving ventilation. Administering bronchodilators helps to open airways and improve airflow, reducing airway resistance and work of breathing.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow to achieve SpO2 > 95% can suppress the hypoxic drive in COPD patients, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2, potentially causing respiratory failure. Encouraging rapid, shallow breathing will not improve gas exchange and may worsen dyspnea by increasing the work of breathing without improving ventilation. Placing the client in a supine position can restrict lung expansion and diaphragmatic movement, worsening dyspnea. Withholding bronchodilators will not address the underlying bronchoconstriction contributing to the client's respiratory distress, leading to further airway obstruction and increased work of breathing.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "COPD patients rely on hypoxic drive for breathing; avoid excessive oxygen administration to prevent respiratory depression.",

        "questionTrap": "The question focuses on prioritizing interventions based on the client's ABG results and COPD diagnosis. The distractor options may seem helpful in other respiratory conditions but are contraindicated or less effective in COPD due to the risk of suppressing the hypoxic drive or increasing the work of breathing.",
