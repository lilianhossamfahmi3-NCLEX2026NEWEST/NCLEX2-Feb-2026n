    "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is appropriate for COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to prolong exhalation, prevent air trapping, and reduce dyspnea. Positioning the client in high Fowler's promotes optimal lung expansion. Administering bronchodilators helps to open airways and improve airflow.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow to achieve SpO2 > 95% can suppress the hypoxic drive in COPD patients, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2. Encouraging rapid, shallow breathing will not improve gas exchange and may worsen dyspnea. Placing the client in a supine position can restrict lung expansion. Withholding bronchodilators will not address the underlying bronchoconstriction contributing to the client's respiratory distress.",
