  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Monitoring for signs of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is crucial because Addison's disease leads to aldosterone deficiency, which affects sodium and potassium balance. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys.  Assessing for orthostatic hypotension helps detect fluid volume deficits and potential cardiovascular compromise due to aldosterone deficiency and subsequent sodium and water loss. Educating the patient about the importance of medication adherence is paramount because hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement therapy are essential for managing the hormone deficiencies associated with Addison's disease.  Missing doses can quickly lead to adrenal crisis.",
    "incorrect": "Frequent skin assessments are not directly related to the hormonal imbalances of Addison's disease, though skin changes like hyperpigmentation can be present. The primary focus is on the effects of electrolyte and fluid imbalances. Measuring abdominal girth is more relevant for conditions involving ascites or fluid retention within the abdominal cavity, rather than the fluid depletion seen in Addison's disease. Limiting sodium intake is contraindicated in Addison's disease, as patients tend to lose sodium and need adequate replacement to maintain fluid balance. Restricting sodium can worsen hyponatremia and dehydration.",
