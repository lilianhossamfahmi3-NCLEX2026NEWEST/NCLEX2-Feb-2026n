    "correct": "Uterine atony, retained placental fragments, and lacerations are risk factors for PPH. Elevated WBC can be a normal postpartum finding, but in conjunction with other findings, could indicate infection. Mild afterpains are a normal physiological response to uterine involution. Lochia rubra is the expected type of vaginal discharge in the early postpartum period.",
    "incorrect": "A firm fundus significantly reduces the risk of PPH because it indicates that the uterus is contracting effectively to constrict blood vessels. Moderate lochia rubra is expected and does not indicate excessive bleeding. Stable vital signs are reassuring. Elevated WBC is common in the postpartum period due to the stress of labor and delivery; in the absence of other signs of infection, it is not indicative of PPH risk.",
