    "correct": "Elevated troponin and CK-MB levels are indicative of myocardial necrosis, which is the hallmark of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  The patient's chest pain, ECG changes (not explicitly stated but inferred from the care plan), and elevated cardiac enzymes strongly support this diagnosis.",
    "incorrect": "Pulmonary embolism typically presents with sudden onset shortness of breath, chest pain (often pleuritic), and hypoxia. While the patient has shortness of breath, the elevated cardiac enzymes point strongly towards cardiac etiology.  Furthermore, the slow onset and associated symptoms are less suggestive of PE.  Hypertensive crisis presents with severely elevated blood pressure (typically >180/120) and end-organ damage. While the patient's blood pressure is elevated, it doesn't reach the threshold for a hypertensive crisis. Additionally, the elevated cardiac enzymes are not associated with hypertensive crisis.  Pneumonia would likely present with fever, productive cough, and abnormal lung sounds. While the patient has crackles, the absence of other signs, combined with the elevated cardiac enzymes, makes pneumonia less likely.",

      "Elevated troponin levels are highly specific for myocardial damage.",
      "Timing of cardiac enzyme release is important; troponin typically rises within 3-12 hours of symptom onset.",
