        "correct": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, constipation), vital signs (bradycardia), physical exam findings (dry skin), and lab results (elevated TSH, low Free T4) are consistent with hypothyroidism. Post-thyroidectomy patients require careful monitoring of thyroid hormone levels and often require dosage adjustments to maintain optimal thyroid function. The absence of hyperthyroid symptoms further supports this diagnosis.",

        "incorrect": "The patient's symptoms and lab values do not support hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism would present with symptoms like tachycardia, weight loss, anxiety, and elevated T4/T3 levels. While anxiety can cause some overlapping symptoms, the bradycardia and constipation are more indicative of hypothyroidism.",

            "solution": "Consider the overall clinical picture, including lab values, vital signs, physical exam, and patient history, to differentiate between conditions and comorbidities. Focus on the constellation of findings rather than individual symptoms.",
            "description": "Students may be tempted to attribute some findings solely to anxiety, rather than considering the overall clinical picture suggesting hypothyroidism. The bradycardia and constipation are strong indicators not attributable to anxiety and should prompt consideration of hypothyroidism, especially post-thyroidectomy."

Background: History of Graves' disease, hypertension, and anxiety. Thyroidectomy performed due to hyperthyroidism unresponsive to medical management. Assessment: Patient reports increasing fatigue and constipation over the past month. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Current medications include levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, and alprazolam 0.5 mg PRN anxiety.
