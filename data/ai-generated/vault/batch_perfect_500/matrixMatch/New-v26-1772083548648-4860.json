    "correct": "Bronchiolitis is characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the small airways, leading to increased work of breathing and wheezing. Dehydration is suggested by elevated sodium, BUN, creatinine, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and prolonged capillary refill. Elevated WBC may be a response to the viral infection or stress.",

    "incorrect": "Not selecting bronchiolitis for respiratory findings, or dehydration for signs of fluid volume deficit would indicate a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions.
