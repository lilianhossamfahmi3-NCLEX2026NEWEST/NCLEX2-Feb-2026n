        "correct": "Administering oxygen supports oxygenation in the setting of blood loss, preventing hypoxia. Initiating a rapid response ensures timely intervention by a multidisciplinary team to manage the hemorrhage effectively. Starting an IV infusion of crystalloid fluids helps to restore intravascular volume, counteracting hypovolemia. Preparing to administer blood products addresses the potential need for transfusion due to significant blood loss, preventing further hemodynamic compromise. Elevating the client's legs promotes venous return and helps to improve blood pressure, supporting circulation.",
        "incorrect": "Encouraging the client to ambulate is contraindicated due to the risk of falls and further compromise in the setting of hypotension and heavy bleeding. Ambulation increases the risk of injury. Documenting findings and continuing to monitor is insufficient in the face of active hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. This delays critical interventions. Applying fundal pressure without response to massage may worsen the situation and cause further trauma. Effective fundal massage should be attempted first. Obtaining a hemoglobin and hematocrit level is important but does not address the immediate need for intervention. These labs will be useful, but are not the priority.",
