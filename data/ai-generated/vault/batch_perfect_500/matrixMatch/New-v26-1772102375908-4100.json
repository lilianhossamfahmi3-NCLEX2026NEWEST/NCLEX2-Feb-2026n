    "correct": "Administering oxygen supports oxygenation in the setting of blood loss. Initiating a rapid response ensures timely intervention by a multidisciplinary team. Starting an IV infusion of crystalloid fluids helps to restore intravascular volume. Preparing to administer blood products addresses the potential need for transfusion due to significant blood loss. Elevating the client's legs promotes venous return and helps to improve blood pressure.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging the client to ambulate is contraindicated due to the risk of falls and further compromise in the setting of hypotension and heavy bleeding. Documenting findings and continuing to monitor is insufficient in the face of active hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. Applying fundal pressure without response to massage may worsen the situation and cause further trauma. Obtaining a hemoglobin and hematocrit level is important but does not address the immediate need for intervention.",
