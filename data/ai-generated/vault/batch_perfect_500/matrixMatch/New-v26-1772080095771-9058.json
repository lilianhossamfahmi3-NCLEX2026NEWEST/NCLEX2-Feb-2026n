    "correct": "Increased oxygen saturation suggests improved gas exchange. Decreased respiratory rate indicates a reduction in the work of breathing. Improved subjective reports of shortness of breath indicates better respiratory function.",

      "meaning": "Assessment Indicates Respiratory status"
    },
    "incorrect": "Stable or worsening respiratory rate, unchanged oxygen saturation, or increased work of breathing would indicate no change or decline in respiratory status.  A productive cough doesn't necessarily indicate improvement, decline or no change, it is a symptom and requires assessment of other data to determine improvement, decline or no change.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reason": "Students may be tempted to focus on a single data point, such as the respiratory rate, without considering other factors like oxygen saturation and patient report.  Students may also incorrectly assume productive cough is indicative of improvement when it requires a bigger picture assessment.",
