    "correct": "AKI is characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function, often reversible with prompt treatment. The elevated creatinine and BUN, decreased urine output, and recent ciprofloxacin use (potentially nephrotoxic) are all suggestive of AKI. Peaked T waves on EKG indicate hyperkalemia, a common complication of AKI due to the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium. CKD develops gradually over time and is characterized by irreversible kidney damage.",

    },
    "incorrect": "While some findings may be present in both AKI and CKD, the acute nature of the presentation, recent UTI treatment with a potentially nephrotoxic antibiotic, and rapid rise in creatinine and BUN point more strongly toward AKI. CKD typically presents with a more gradual onset and is often associated with long-standing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which the patient has, but are not the primary drivers of the current acute presentation. The rapid hyperkalemia is also more indicative of acute kidney dysfunction.",

He has a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent urinary tract infection (UTI) treated with ciprofloxacin.\nB: The patient presented to the emergency department confused and weak. Laboratory tests were drawn. Prior to admission, the patient reported decreased urine output over the past two days. His home medications include lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. He completed a course of ciprofloxacin three days prior for the UTI.\nA: At 07:00, the patient is increasingly lethargic. His blood pressure is 170/98 mmHg, heart rate is 92 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. Urine output since admission is 50 mL. An EKG shows peaked T waves. The potassium level is 6.8 mEq/L. Creatinine is 3.5 mg/dL, and BUN is 55 mg/dL.\nR: I recommend notifying nephrology STAT. Anticipate orders for calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, and possible dialysis. Monitor EKG and potassium levels closely. Assess the patient's level of consciousness and urine output hourly. Consider the possibility of Ciprofloxacin induced AKI.",
