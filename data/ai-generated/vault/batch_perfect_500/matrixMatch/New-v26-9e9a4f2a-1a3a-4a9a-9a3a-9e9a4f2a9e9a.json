        "correct": "Administering mannitol is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering oxygen is indicated to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further hypoxia, which can exacerbate brain injury. Hypertonic saline is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP by creating an osmotic gradient that draws fluid out of the brain tissue. Initiating seizure precautions is indicated as increased ICP can increase the risk of seizures. These precautions include padding the side rails, having suction equipment readily available, and close monitoring.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Administering a hypotonic solution is contraindicated as it can worsen cerebral edema by causing fluid to shift into brain cells due to osmosis. Lowering the head of the bed is contraindicated, as it increases ICP by impeding venous drainage from the brain. Fluid bolus administration is generally contraindicated in patients with increased ICP unless they are also hypotensive due to other causes, as it can exacerbate cerebral edema. Encouraging coughing is contraindicated as it can transiently increase ICP due to increased intrathoracic pressure.",

            "trap": "Students may incorrectly assume that because the patient is hypotensive, a fluid bolus is needed. However, the hypertension is likely a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in the setting of increased ICP (Cushing's Triad).",
            "howToOvercome": "Carefully assess the patient's overall clinical picture, including neurological status, and consider the underlying cause of the blood pressure changes before administering fluids. Prioritize interventions that directly address the increased ICP."

He initially showed improvement in left-sided weakness but has declined significantly over the last hour. \nA: At 0700, the patient became increasingly lethargic. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score has dropped from 14 to 9. The right pupil is now sluggishly reactive, and the left pupil remains 3mm and reactive. His blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm, and respiratory rate is 10 breaths per minute with shallow breathing. His oxygen saturation is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. The family at the bedside is increasingly concerned. I administered 4mg of ondansetron IV at 0715 for nausea reported by the patient.\nA: I suspect increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to edema from the stroke. Possible Cushing's Triad.\nR: I recommend a STAT neuro consult, possible transfer to CT for imaging, and orders for mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce ICP.
