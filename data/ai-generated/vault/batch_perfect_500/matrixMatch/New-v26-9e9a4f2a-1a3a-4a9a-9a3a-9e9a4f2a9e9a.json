    "correct": "Administering mannitol is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering oxygen is indicated to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further hypoxia, which can exacerbate brain injury. Hypertonic saline is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP. Initiating seizure precautions is indicated as increased ICP can increase the risk of seizures.",

    "incorrect": "Administering a hypotonic solution is contraindicated as it can worsen cerebral edema by causing fluid to shift into brain cells. Lowering the head of the bed is contraindicated, as it increases ICP. Fluid bolus administration is generally contraindicated in patients with increased ICP unless they are also hypotensive due to other causes, as it can exacerbate cerebral edema. Encouraging coughing is contraindicated as it can transiently increase ICP.",

He initially showed improvement in left-sided weakness but has declined significantly over the last hour. A: At 0700, patient became increasingly lethargic. GCS score has dropped from 14 to 9. Right pupil is now sluggishly reactive, and left pupil remains 3mm and reactive. BP is 190/110, HR is 52, and RR is 10 with shallow breathing. O2 sat is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Family at bedside is increasingly concerned. I administered 4mg of ondansetron at 0715 for nausea reported by the patient. A: I suspect increased ICP secondary to edema from the stroke. R: I recommend STAT neuro consult, possible transfer to CT, and orders for mannitol or hypertonic saline. Possible intubation may be needed.",
