    "correct": "Elevated lactate levels are a hallmark of sepsis, indicating anaerobic metabolism due to hypoperfusion. Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) is common in sepsis due to increased consumption and decreased production. Elevated creatinine suggests acute kidney injury, a frequent complication of sepsis due to decreased renal perfusion. Procalcitonin is a marker of bacterial infection and is typically elevated in sepsis.",

    "incorrect": "Normal WBC count is not typically associated with sepsis, as it is usually elevated due to the body's inflammatory response. Normal creatinine, platelet, procalcitonin, or lactate levels would not be expected in a patient experiencing sepsis.

His heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 28, and BP is 90/50 mmHg. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. O2 saturation is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Lactate is elevated at 4.0 mmol/L. WBC is 15,000. A: Suspect sepsis secondary to pneumonia given vital signs, lab results and overall presentation. Implementing sepsis protocol. Requesting immediate MD assessment and orders. Initiated fluid bolus of 500 mL NS. Blood cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics are due at 08:00. 07:30: Patient remains hypotensive and requires increased oxygen support. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Plan to repeat lactate in one hour. Continue to monitor vital signs closely.",
