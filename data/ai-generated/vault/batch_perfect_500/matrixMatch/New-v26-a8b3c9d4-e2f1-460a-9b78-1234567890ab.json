        "correct": "Elevated lactate levels are a hallmark of sepsis, indicating anaerobic metabolism due to hypoperfusion. In sepsis, the body's demand for oxygen exceeds its supply, leading to anaerobic metabolism and increased lactate production. Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) is common in sepsis due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where platelets are consumed excessively. Elevated creatinine suggests acute kidney injury (AKI), a frequent complication of sepsis due to decreased renal perfusion and direct tubular damage from inflammatory mediators. Procalcitonin is a marker of bacterial infection and is typically elevated in sepsis due to the release of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial toxins. These findings collectively support a diagnosis of sepsis and indicate organ dysfunction.",

        "incorrect": "Normal WBC count is not typically associated with sepsis, as it is usually elevated due to the body's inflammatory response. However, in some cases, especially in immunocompromised patients, the WBC count may be normal or even low. Normal creatinine, platelet, procalcitonin, or lactate levels would not be expected in a patient experiencing sepsis. A normal temperature or low temperature (hypothermia) is seen in some cases of sepsis, but the patient in this scenario has a high fever. Hyperthermia is more common.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "trap": "Students may focus only on the elevated temperature and WBC and miss the significance of the other lab values and vital sign changes, leading them to choose only findings consistent with infection but not specifically sepsis. Students might also overlook the significance of thrombocytopenia and elevated creatinine as indicators of organ dysfunction in sepsis.",
            "howToOvercome": "Emphasize the importance of considering the entire clinical picture, including vital signs, lab values, and patient presentation, to differentiate between infection and sepsis. Encourage students to recognize that sepsis involves a dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction, not just infection."
