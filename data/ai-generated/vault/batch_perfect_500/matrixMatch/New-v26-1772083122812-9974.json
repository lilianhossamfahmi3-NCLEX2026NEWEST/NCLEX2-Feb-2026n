    "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. Key indicators include elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, elevated respiratory rate, fever, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate, altered mental status, and evidence of infection (e.g., pneumonia on chest X-ray).",

    "incorrect": "Some findings are indicative of other conditions or are less specific to sepsis. For example, rhonchi can be present in COPD or other respiratory illnesses. Normal oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen does not rule out sepsis, but low saturation without support is concerning. Absence of edema does not rule out sepsis.",
