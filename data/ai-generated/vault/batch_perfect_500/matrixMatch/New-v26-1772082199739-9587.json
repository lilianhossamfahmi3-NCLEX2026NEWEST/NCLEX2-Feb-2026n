    "correct": "The presence of an S3 heart sound, elevated BNP, pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray, lower extremity edema, and uncontrolled hypertension all support a diagnosis of HFpEF in this patient. HFpEF is characterized by impaired ventricular relaxation and diastolic dysfunction, leading to increased filling pressures and subsequent symptoms of heart failure despite a preserved ejection fraction.",

      "HFpEF": "Hypertension, Filling pressures elevated, Preserved Ejection Fraction, Edema, Fatigue"

    "incorrect": "While isolated hypertension or edema can be associated with other conditions, the combination of these findings, along with the elevated BNP and pulmonary congestion, strongly suggests HFpEF. A normal ejection fraction (not provided, but implied as HFpEF) further supports this diagnosis.  Ignoring the S3 heart sound and elevated BNP would lead to an incorrect assessment.",
