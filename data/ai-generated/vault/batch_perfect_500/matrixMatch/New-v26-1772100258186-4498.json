Left-sided heart failure leads to pulmonary congestion, causing crackles and shortness of breath because the left ventricle cannot pump blood efficiently to the body, leading to a backup of blood into the pulmonary circulation. Elevated BNP levels are indicative of heart failure, as the heart releases BNP in response to ventricular stretching.",
