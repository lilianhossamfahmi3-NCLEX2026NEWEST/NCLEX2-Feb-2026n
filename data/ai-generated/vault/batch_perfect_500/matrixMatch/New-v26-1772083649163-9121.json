        "correct": "Elevated blood pressure and proteinuria are key indicators of preeclampsia. Elevated fasting blood glucose is a key indicator of gestational diabetes. Thrombocytopenia can be associated with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria (or other signs of end-organ damage) after 20 weeks of gestation. The elevated blood pressure damages the endothelial lining of blood vessels, leading to increased vascular permeability and proteinuria. Thrombocytopenia results from platelet activation and consumption as part of the disease process. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when glucose intolerance is first recognized during pregnancy, often due to insulin resistance caused by placental hormones. A fasting blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL exceeds the normal range for pregnant women, indicating impaired glucose metabolism.",

        "incorrect": "Normal edema and fundal height don't indicate preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. Normal fetal heart tones do not differentiate between preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Normal deep tendon reflexes don't indicate preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. Mild anemia can be present in pregnancy and is not specific to either condition. Edema is common in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and decreased colloid osmotic pressure. Fundal height and fetal heart tones are general assessments of fetal well-being but do not specifically point to preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. Deep tendon reflexes are assessed to evaluate for hyperreflexia, which is associated with preeclampsia, but normal reflexes do not rule it out. Mild anemia is a common physiological change in pregnancy due to hemodilution.",

            "explanation": "Be careful not to assume all pregnant women with edema have preeclampsia. Consider all findings together. Distinguish between chronic hypertension and preeclampsia. Edema alone is not diagnostic; it must be considered in conjunction with other signs and symptoms, such as elevated blood pressure and proteinuria. The patient's history of chronic hypertension further complicates the diagnosis, as it can be difficult to differentiate between chronic hypertension and superimposed preeclampsia."
