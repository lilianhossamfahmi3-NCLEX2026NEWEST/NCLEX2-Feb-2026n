            "preeclampsia": "Elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred vision, proteinuria, and hyperreflexia with clonus are all consistent with preeclampsia. These symptoms indicate potential end-organ damage and central nervous system irritability, requiring immediate intervention to prevent severe complications such as seizures (eclampsia) or stroke.",
            "postpartumHemorrhage": "None of the provided findings are consistent with postpartum hemorrhage. The fundus is firm and midline, and lochia is within normal limits. Postpartum hemorrhage is characterized by excessive bleeding, a boggy uterus, and signs of hypovolemia.",
            "normalPostpartumFinding": "A firm and midline fundus is a normal postpartum finding, indicating proper uterine contraction and reduced risk of hemorrhage. While some headache can be normal, this patient's headache in conjunction with blurred vision and elevated blood pressure suggests a more serious condition like preeclampsia, necessitating further evaluation."

            "preeclampsiaSymptoms": "HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) is associated with preeclampsia, along with Hypertension and Proteinuria. Remember to assess for these signs in postpartum patients, especially those with elevated blood pressure."

        "incorrect": {
            "preeclampsia": "Attributing all findings to normal postpartum recovery or postpartum hemorrhage could delay crucial intervention and put the patient at risk for complications such as eclampsia, stroke, or organ failure. Prompt recognition and management of preeclampsia are essential to prevent adverse outcomes.",
            "postpartumHemorrhage": "Misinterpreting preeclampsia symptoms as postpartum hemorrhage could lead to inappropriate treatment, such as administering uterotonic medications when antihypertensives and seizure prophylaxis are needed. This misdiagnosis could potentially lead to dangerous outcomes for the patient.",
            "normalPostpartumFinding": "Failing to recognize the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia as distinct from normal postpartum findings can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. This delay can result in severe complications, including seizures, stroke, and even death. Vigilant monitoring and assessment are crucial."

        "questionTrap": {
            "trap1": "The headache could be easily attributed to a normal postpartum symptom, however, in conjunction with blurry vision and elevated BP, this should raise suspicion for preeclampsia. Always consider the constellation of symptoms rather than isolating individual findings.",
            "trap2": "The moderate lochia and firm fundus could cause one to rule out hemorrhage when in fact, the patient is demonstrating s/s of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can occur even with normal postpartum bleeding and uterine tone."
