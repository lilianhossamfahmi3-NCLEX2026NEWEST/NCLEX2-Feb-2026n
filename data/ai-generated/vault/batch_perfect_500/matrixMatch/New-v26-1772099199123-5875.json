        "correct": "Maintaining a neutral head position promotes venous drainage from the brain and reduces intracranial pressure. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes that could indicate complications such as increased ICP or hematoma formation. Administering prescribed pain medication helps manage pain and prevent increases in intracranial pressure due to pain-related stress. Monitoring fluid balance helps prevent fluid overload, which can increase intracranial pressure. Implementing seizure precautions is important because craniotomy patients are at increased risk for seizures due to brain tissue manipulation and potential irritation.",
        "mnemonic": "Maintain Neutral Head, Monitor Neuro, Medicate Pain, Manage Fluids, Monitor Seizures (5 M's)",
        "incorrect": "Elevating the head of the bed to 45 degrees may be appropriate in some cases, but a neutral head position is generally preferred to avoid neck flexion, which can impede venous drainage and increase ICP. Encouraging coughing and deep breathing can transiently increase intracranial pressure. Clustering nursing activities can disrupt rest and increase intracranial pressure. Restricting fluids is not routinely indicated unless there is evidence of fluid overload or SIADH; adequate hydration is crucial for cerebral perfusion.",
