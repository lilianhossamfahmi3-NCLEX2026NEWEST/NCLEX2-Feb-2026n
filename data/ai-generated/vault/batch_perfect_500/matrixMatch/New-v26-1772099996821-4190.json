Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to shock. Decreased urine output suggests kidney dysfunction, further compromising the body's ability to maintain homeostasis.",
        "incorrect": "While an elevated white blood cell count (WBC > 12,000/μL) and elevated temperature (>38.3°C or 101°F) are indicative of infection and inflammation, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension and decreased urine output. Tachycardia is expected in sepsis as the body attempts to compensate for decreased perfusion, but it is not as critical as hypotension.",
