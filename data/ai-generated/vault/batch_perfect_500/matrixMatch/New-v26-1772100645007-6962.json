        "correct": "Administering oxygen helps improve oxygen saturation in the setting of blood loss and potential hypovolemia. Initiating a rapid response ensures timely intervention by a multidisciplinary team to manage the hemorrhage effectively. Preparing to administer uterotonic medications addresses the most likely cause of the hemorrhage, uterine atony. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter helps to monitor kidney perfusion and output, providing essential data for assessing the client's hemodynamic status.",
        "incorrect": "Fundal massage has already been attempted without success, indicating the need for further interventions. Elevating the legs is a general measure for hypotension but does not address the underlying cause of the hemorrhage. Documenting findings is important but not the priority action when the client is unstable. Encouraging the client to breastfeed is beneficial in the long term but not the priority in this acute situation. Applying ice to the perineum addresses pain and swelling, not the hemorrhage. Preparing for manual removal of the placenta is not the immediate priority, as uterine atony is the most likely cause, but should be considered if uterotonics are ineffective.",
