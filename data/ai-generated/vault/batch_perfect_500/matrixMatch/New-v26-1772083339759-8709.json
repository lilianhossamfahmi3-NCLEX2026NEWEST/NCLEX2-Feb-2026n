        "correct": "Early septic shock is characterized by warm extremities, bounding pulses, and elevated cardiac output due to the body's initial response to infection. Compensated septic shock involves mechanisms like increased heart rate and vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure despite underlying issues. Decompensated septic shock is marked by hypotension and organ dysfunction as compensatory mechanisms fail. Clinical findings such as bounding pulses and warm, flushed skin are indicative of early septic shock due to vasodilation and increased cardiac output. Hypotension is a hallmark of decompensated septic shock, indicating the body's inability to maintain adequate blood pressure. Increased work of breathing and prolonged capillary refill can be seen in both compensated and decompensated stages as the body attempts to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections misinterpret the physiological signs of each stage of septic shock. For example, attributing hypotension to early septic shock or bounding pulses to decompensated septic shock are errors. Confusing the signs of early, compensated, and decompensated shock can lead to delays in appropriate treatment. For instance, a capillary refill of 3 seconds is not typically seen in early septic shock, where it is usually brisk due to vasodilation.",
