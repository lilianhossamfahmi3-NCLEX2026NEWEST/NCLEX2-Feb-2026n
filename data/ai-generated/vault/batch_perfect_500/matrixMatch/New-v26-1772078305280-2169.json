        "correct": "Hypotension in sepsis results from vasodilation and decreased cardiac output, necessitating aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors like norepinephrine to maintain adequate perfusion and blood pressure. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) often occurs due to hypoperfusion and inflammation; management involves careful monitoring of fluid balance, avoiding nephrotoxic agents, and potentially initiating renal replacement therapy (dialysis). Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is characterized by abnormal clotting and bleeding; treatment requires managing the underlying cause (sepsis) with antibiotics and supportive care, including blood product transfusions (platelets, cryoprecipitate) to replace depleted clotting factors.",
