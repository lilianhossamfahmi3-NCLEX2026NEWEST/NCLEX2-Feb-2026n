        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute with increased use of accessory muscles indicates significant respiratory distress and requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory failure.

Mild cyanosis of the nail beds may be expected in COPD patients due to chronic hypoxemia, but should be monitored for worsening. Clubbing of the fingers is a chronic finding in COPD and does not require immediate intervention; it indicates long-term hypoxia.",
