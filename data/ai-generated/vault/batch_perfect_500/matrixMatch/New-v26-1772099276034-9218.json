The child is experiencing increased work of breathing, audible wheezing, and a non-productive cough. The parents report the child has been using their albuterol inhaler every 2 hours for the past 24 hours with minimal relief. Vital signs are as follows: Heart rate 140 bpm, Respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, Oxygen saturation 90% on room air, Temperature 37.2°C (99°F).",

Albuterol nebulizer is the first-line treatment for acute asthma exacerbations to bronchodilate and relieve airway obstruction. Monitoring respiratory effort helps assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Establishing IV access is important for administering medications and fluids if needed.",
