Other findings such as bradycardia, dry skin, fatigue, cold intolerance, and elevated anti-TPO antibodies also support this diagnosis, aligning with the reduced metabolic rate associated with hypothyroidism.",
            "Hyperthyroidism": "None of the findings in this scenario support hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism typically presents with symptoms such as tachycardia, heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, and suppressed TSH levels due to excessive thyroid hormone production."

            "Neither": "Incorrectly attributing a finding to 'Neither' when it is strongly suggestive of either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. This indicates a failure to recognize key indicators of thyroid dysfunction.",
            "Hypothyroidism": "Incorrectly attributing a finding to hypothyroidism that is not typically associated with it, or is more strongly associated with hyperthyroidism. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the specific clinical manifestations of each condition.",
            "Hyperthyroidism": "Incorrectly attributing a finding to hyperthyroidism when it is characteristic of hypothyroidism, or not related to thyroid disorders. This reflects a confusion between the opposing effects of thyroid hormone imbalances."

The presence of elevated anti-TPO antibodies further supports the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis as the underlying cause.",
            "avoidDistractors": "Do not be misled by less specific symptoms like fatigue, which can be present in many conditions.
