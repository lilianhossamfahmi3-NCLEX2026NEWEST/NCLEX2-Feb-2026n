      "Neither": "Normal blood glucose rules out hypoglycemia as the primary cause of the symptoms. Normal CBC and CMP results don't directly point to either stroke or increased ICP. While INR is elevated due to warfarin, it doesn't explain the acute neurological deficits."

      "Increased ICP": "Attributing all findings solely to stroke ignores the possibility of secondary complications or a different primary process causing increased ICP. Incorrect pupil response and Cushing's triad indicate increased ICP.",
      "Stroke": "Ignoring the vital sign abnormalities and pupil changes could delay appropriate treatment for increased ICP, which can worsen the outcome of a stroke or be a separate, life-threatening condition. Not recognizing stroke symptoms leads to delayed treatment.",
