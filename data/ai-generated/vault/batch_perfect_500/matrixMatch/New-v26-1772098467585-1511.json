        "correct": "Hypotension and decreased urine output are critical indicators of organ hypoperfusion and require immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential organ damage in sepsis. Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to shock. Decreased urine output suggests kidney dysfunction, further compromising the body's ability to maintain homeostasis.",
        "mnemonic": "Think 'STOP Sepsis': Seek the source, Take cultures, Obtain blood pressure, Provide fluids/vasopressors.",
        "incorrect": "While elevated white blood cell count and increased respiratory rate are indicative of sepsis, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension and decreased urine output. Elevated WBC indicates the body's immune response to infection. Increased respiratory rate is a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis. These findings should be addressed promptly, but the priority is to stabilize blood pressure and ensure adequate perfusion.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to choose elevated WBC or increased respiratory rate, as they are common signs of infection. However, the question asks for findings requiring IMMEDIATE intervention, making hypotension and decreased urine output the priority. Recognizing the urgency of hypoperfusion is key.",

Situation: Patient presents with fever (38.9°C), altered mental status (confusion), and elevated heart rate (110 bpm). Background: Patient has a history of pneumonia treated 2 weeks ago. He also has type 2 diabetes. Assessment: Current vital signs show hypotension (88/52 mmHg), tachycardia (110 bpm), tachypnea (24 breaths/min), and decreased urine output (20 mL/hr). Labs show elevated WBC count (15,000/mm3). Radiology report pending. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to address hypotension and decreased urine output, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressors if needed. Further investigation into the source of infection is also warranted.",
