    "correct": "Rapid assessment and intervention are crucial in stroke management. Assessing neurological deficits using a standardized stroke scale (NIHSS) helps quantify the severity of the stroke. Initiating stroke protocols prepares the team for potential thrombolytic therapy. Obtaining a CT head without contrast is essential to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before administering thrombolytics. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Monitoring vital signs closely helps to detect changes in the patient's condition.",
    "incorrect": "Administering aspirin without ruling out hemorrhagic stroke can worsen the condition. Waiting for lab results before initiating stroke protocols delays critical treatment. Assessing pain is not the priority in this acute situation. Administering anti-hypertensives too quickly can reduce cerebral perfusion and worsen the stroke.",
