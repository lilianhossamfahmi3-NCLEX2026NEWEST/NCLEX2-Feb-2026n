Right-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and slurred speech are hallmark signs of a stroke and necessitate immediate intervention and further evaluation, including a CT scan to rule out hemorrhage. Symptoms onset within 2 hours indicates patient is within the thrombolytic window, further emphasizing need for immediate assessment and intervention.",
