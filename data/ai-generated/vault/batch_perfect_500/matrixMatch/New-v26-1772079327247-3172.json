    "correct": "Elevated blood pressure (180/100 mmHg) requires immediate management in the context of a suspected stroke to optimize cerebral perfusion without exacerbating potential hemorrhagic transformation. Right-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and slurred speech are hallmark signs of a stroke and necessitate immediate intervention and further evaluation, including a CT scan to rule out hemorrhage. Symptoms onset within 2 hours indicates patient is within the thrombolytic window, further emphasizing need for immediate assessment and intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Regular heart rate and rhythm (90 bpm) within normal limits, while important, does not require immediate action in this acute setting. Clear lung sounds on auscultation do not indicate an immediate life-threatening issue. Patient oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is adequate, and immediate intervention is not required related to respiratory status.",
