        "correct": "Elevated WBC, elevated lactate, fever, hypotension, and altered mental status are all consistent with sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. The immune system releases chemicals into the bloodstream to fight the infection, but this can lead to widespread inflammation and organ damage. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes.",

While COPD may explain some respiratory distress, the combination of these findings points strongly towards sepsis.
