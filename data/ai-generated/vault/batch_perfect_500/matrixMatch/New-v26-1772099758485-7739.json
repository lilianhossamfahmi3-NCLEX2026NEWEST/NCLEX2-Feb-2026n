        "correct": "Respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, use of accessory muscles, and anxious state all indicate significant respiratory distress and require immediate intervention. These findings suggest that the child is not adequately oxygenating and may be tiring out. The elevated respiratory rate and decreased oxygen saturation are critical indicators of respiratory compromise, while the use of accessory muscles demonstrates increased work of breathing. An anxious state can exacerbate respiratory distress and should be addressed promptly. The rapid heart rate is likely compensatory.",
        "incorrect": "While heart rate of 120 is elevated, it is expected with respiratory distress and is not the priority. The primary concern is the respiratory status. The child's age is relevant for medication dosing, but does not require immediate action. History of asthma is important, but the current assessment findings are the priority. Each of these findings, while relevant, do not individually represent the same level of immediate threat to the patient's well-being as the combined respiratory indicators.",
