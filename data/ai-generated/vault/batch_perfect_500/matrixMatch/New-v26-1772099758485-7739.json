The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The child is anxious and using accessory muscles to breathe. The nurse is preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment. Which assessment findings require immediate action or notification of the healthcare provider?",

    "correct": "Respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and use of accessory muscles indicate significant respiratory distress and require immediate intervention. These findings suggest that the child is not adequately oxygenating and may be tiring out. Anxious state is also a concern, but is secondary to the physiological findings.",
    "incorrect": "While heart rate of 120 is elevated, it is expected with respiratory distress. The primary concern is the respiratory status. The child's age is relevant for medication dosing, but does not require immediate action. History of asthma is important, but the current assessment findings are the priority.",
