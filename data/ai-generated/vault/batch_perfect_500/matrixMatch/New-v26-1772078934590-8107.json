    "correct": "HFrEF is characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (typically ≤40%), while HFpEF has a normal or near-normal ejection fraction (typically ≥50%) with evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Both can present with similar symptoms, but the underlying pathophysiology and management strategies differ.",
