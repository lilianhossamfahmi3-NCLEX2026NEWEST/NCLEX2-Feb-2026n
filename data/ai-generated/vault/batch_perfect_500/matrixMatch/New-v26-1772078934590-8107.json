        "correct": "HFrEF is characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (typically ≤40%), indicating a systolic dysfunction where the heart muscle cannot contract effectively to pump blood out. HFpEF, on the other hand, presents with a normal or near-normal ejection fraction (typically ≥50%) but with evidence of diastolic dysfunction, meaning the heart muscle has difficulty relaxing and filling with blood. Both conditions can manifest with similar symptoms like dyspnea and edema, but their underlying causes and treatment approaches differ significantly.\n\nElevated BNP levels are indicative of heart failure in general, as the heart releases BNP in response to ventricular stretch and increased wall tension. An S3 heart sound is often associated with HFrEF due to the rapid filling of a dilated ventricle. Diastolic dysfunction, identified via echocardiogram, is a hallmark of HFpEF. A history of hyperlipidemia, while a cardiovascular risk factor, is not specifically indicative of either HFrEF or HFpEF but contributes to overall cardiovascular disease risk.",
        "mnemonic": {
            "name": "REDUCED vs. PRESERVED",
            "description": "Remember that 'REDUCED' refers to the ejection fraction being lower than normal (systolic dysfunction), while 'PRESERVED' means the ejection fraction is normal or near-normal (diastolic dysfunction)."
        },
        "incorrect": "Incorrectly identifying findings as consistent with one type of heart failure when they are more suggestive of the other, or attributing findings to heart failure when they are unrelated, can lead to inappropriate treatment and potentially adverse outcomes. For example, mistaking diastolic dysfunction as systolic dysfunction might lead to inappropriate use of medications targeting systolic function.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reasoning": "Many symptoms, such as dyspnea and edema, are common to both types of heart failure. Careful consideration of the ejection fraction and other diagnostic findings is crucial for accurate differentiation. Relying solely on symptoms without considering the ejection fraction and diastolic function can lead to misdiagnosis.",
            "commonMistake": "Confusing symptoms that can occur in both HFrEF and HFpEF and attributing them solely to one condition. For example, assuming that dyspnea automatically indicates HFrEF without considering the ejection fraction."

        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Echocardiography is essential for differentiating between HFrEF and HFpEF by assessing ejection fraction and diastolic function.",
            "BNP levels are often elevated in both types of heart failure but can be higher in HFrEF due to greater ventricular stretch.",
            "Management of HFrEF often involves medications like ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNIs, beta-blockers, and diuretics to improve systolic function and reduce volume overload, while HFpEF management focuses more on symptom control, addressing underlying comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes, and using diuretics for volume management."
