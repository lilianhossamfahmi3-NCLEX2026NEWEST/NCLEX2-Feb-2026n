    "correct": "Hyperpigmentation is caused by increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) production, which is a byproduct of increased ACTH. Hypotension results from decreased aldosterone, leading to sodium and water loss. Hypoglycemia is due to decreased cortisol, which normally increases blood glucose levels.
