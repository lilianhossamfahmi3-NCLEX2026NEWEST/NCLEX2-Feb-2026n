        "correct": "Hyperpigmentation is caused by increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) production, which is a byproduct of increased ACTH. Hypotension results from decreased aldosterone, leading to sodium and water loss, and decreased vascular tone. Hypoglycemia is due to decreased cortisol, which normally increases blood glucose levels through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, impairing potassium excretion by the kidneys. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys.\n\n",
