        "correct": "Dyspnea and decreased oxygen saturation are signs of impaired gas exchange, resulting from the client's COPD exacerbation. The inflamed and constricted airways hinder effective oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. A productive cough indicates ineffective airway clearance due to increased mucus production and impaired mucociliary clearance, common in COPD. The oxygen order is a direct intervention aimed at improving oxygenation by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired air, thereby facilitating greater oxygen uptake in the lungs.",

        "incorrect": "Incorrect matching of assessment findings to categories indicates a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and appropriate interventions for COPD exacerbation. This could lead to inappropriate or delayed treatment, potentially worsening the client's condition.",

            "In COPD patients, avoid high concentrations of oxygen, as it can suppress the hypoxic drive, potentially leading to respiratory depression. Titrate oxygen to maintain an SpO2 of 88-92%.",
