Lab results show a WBC count of 15,500/µL and elevated lactate. He was started on IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics one hour ago. The patient's condition is deteriorating despite initial interventions. I am concerned about possible septic shock. I recommend escalating care and considering vasopressors. Do you have any orders?",

Decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) is a sign of kidney hypoperfusion, which can lead to acute kidney injury. Immediate intervention is needed to improve renal perfusion and prevent further kidney damage. ClinicalPearl: Early recognition and aggressive management of hypotension and oliguria are critical in preventing septic shock and improving patient outcomes. Mnemonic: 'Urine & Pressure Down? Act NOW!'",
        "incorrect": "Elevated heart rate (120 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism in response to sepsis but does not require immediate intervention as long as blood pressure is maintained. Elevated white blood cell count (15,000/µL) is an expected finding in sepsis but does not require immediate intervention unless there are other signs of organ dysfunction. Elevated temperature (38.5°C) is a common symptom of sepsis but is not as critical as hypotension or decreased urine output.
