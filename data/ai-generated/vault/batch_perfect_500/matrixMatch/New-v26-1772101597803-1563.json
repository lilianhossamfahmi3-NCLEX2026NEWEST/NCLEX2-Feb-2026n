A: Current vital signs include a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. The patient is using accessory muscles to breathe, indicating respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals significant wheezing in all lung fields.

Further interventions may be necessary based on the patient's response to the initial treatment. Consider oxygen supplementation if SpO2 does not improve with albuterol.

        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and the use of accessory muscles to breathe are all indicators of significant respiratory distress in a child with asthma exacerbation. These findings necessitate immediate action, including potential escalation of care such as oxygen supplementation or additional medications, and notification of the healthcare provider. The albuterol treatment alone may not be sufficient to resolve the distress.",
        "incorrect": "An elevated heart rate of 120 beats per minute is expected in a child experiencing respiratory distress as a compensatory mechanism. While anxiety is present, addressing the respiratory distress is the priority. Preparing to administer nebulized albuterol is an appropriate initial intervention, but the nurse must continuously monitor the patient's response and be prepared to escalate care if needed. These findings alone do not indicate the need for immediate notification before the albuterol treatment is given time to take effect.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "In pediatric asthma exacerbations, early recognition of respiratory distress is crucial to prevent respiratory failure.",
            "Assess respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and use of accessory muscles to determine the severity of the exacerbation.",
            "Nebulized albuterol is a common initial treatment, but continuous monitoring and potential escalation of care are essential. Worsening respiratory status despite initial treatment requires immediate notification of the healthcare provider."
        ],
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking that preparing the nebulizer is the most important action, when in reality, the nurse must recognize the severity of the distress and the need for possible escalation of care. Focusing solely on the albuterol preparation can lead to overlooking critical signs of worsening respiratory status.",
