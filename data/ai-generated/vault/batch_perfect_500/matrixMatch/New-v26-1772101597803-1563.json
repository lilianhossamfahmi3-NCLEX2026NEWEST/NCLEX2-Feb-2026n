    "correct": "Respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and use of accessory muscles indicate significant respiratory distress and require immediate intervention. These findings suggest the albuterol treatment may not be sufficient, and further interventions such as oxygen supplementation or additional medications may be necessary.",
    "incorrect": "Heart rate of 120 beats per minute is elevated but expected in a child experiencing respiratory distress. While anxiety is present, addressing the respiratory distress is the priority. Preparing to administer nebulized albuterol is an appropriate initial intervention, but the nurse must continuously monitor the patient's response and be prepared to escalate care if needed.",

      "In pediatric asthma exacerbations, early recognition of respiratory distress is crucial.",
