    "correct": "Increased heart rate is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Elevated WBC count indicates an active infection, further supporting the diagnosis of septic shock. Decreased urine output reflects inadequate renal perfusion due to hypotension and reduced cardiac output. Low CVP suggests hypovolemia or inadequate venous return, common in septic shock.",

Anemia (low hemoglobin) is not indicated by the lab results and therefore not the most relevant explanation for the patient's presentation. Hypervolemia would be indicated by elevated CVP, not the observed low CVP. Hypothermia is not present; the patient has a fever.",

B: He has a history of hypertension and COPD, and was treated for pneumonia with IV antibiotics. O: At 07:00, his BP is 80/50 mmHg, HR is 120 bpm, RR is 32, SpO2 is 90% on 4L NC. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). CVP is 2 mmHg, and urine output is 20 mL/hr. Lab results show a lactate level of 4.5 mmol/L and a WBC count of 18,000/uL. A: I suspect septic shock secondary to pneumonia. He is currently on standard precautions and will need to be placed on droplet precautions. P: I recommend continuing antibiotics, starting vasopressors (norepinephrine), administering a bolus of crystalloid fluids, and closely monitoring vital signs and urine output. Please contact me if there are any changes.",
