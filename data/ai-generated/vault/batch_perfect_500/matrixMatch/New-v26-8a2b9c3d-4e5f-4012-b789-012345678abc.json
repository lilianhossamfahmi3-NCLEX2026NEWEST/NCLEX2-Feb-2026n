        "correct": "Increased heart rate is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Elevated WBC count indicates an active infection, further supporting the diagnosis of septic shock. Decreased urine output reflects inadequate renal perfusion due to hypotension and reduced cardiac output. Low CVP suggests hypovolemia or inadequate venous return, common in septic shock.\n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and treatment of septic shock are crucial to improve patient outcomes. Hemodynamic monitoring, including CVP, is essential in managing patients with shock. Elevated lactate levels indicate anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoperfusion.",

Hypothermia is not present; the patient has a fever.\n\nquestionTrap: Students may focus solely on the fever and assume it's a simple infection, overlooking the signs of shock.
