Monitoring respiratory status frequently allows for early detection of changes and timely intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow rate above prescribed limits can suppress the hypoxic drive in COPD patients, leading to decreased respiratory effort. Administering sedatives can further depress respiratory function in a client already experiencing respiratory acidosis. Encouraging deep breathing exercises can lead to air trapping and increased dyspnea in COPD patients. Placing the client in a supine position can impair lung expansion and worsen dyspnea.",
