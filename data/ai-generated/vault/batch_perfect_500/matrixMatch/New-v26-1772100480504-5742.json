        "correct": "Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92% is appropriate for COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive, which is their primary stimulus for breathing. Encouraging pursed-lip breathing helps to prolong exhalation, prevent air trapping, and reduce dyspnea by creating back pressure in the airways. Positioning the client in high Fowler's promotes optimal lung expansion, facilitating improved gas exchange. Frequent monitoring of respiratory status allows for early detection of changes and timely intervention to prevent further deterioration.  clinicalPearl: COPD patients retain CO2, and their bodies adapt to high CO2 levels. Therefore, their primary drive to breathe becomes hypoxia, not hypercapnia.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow rate above prescribed limits (e.g., to 100%) can suppress the hypoxic drive in COPD patients, leading to decreased respiratory effort and potentially respiratory arrest. Administering sedatives can further depress respiratory function in a client already experiencing respiratory acidosis, worsening their condition. Encouraging deep breathing exercises can lead to air trapping and increased dyspnea in COPD patients due to their decreased lung elasticity and increased residual volume. Placing the client in a supine position can impair lung expansion and worsen dyspnea, especially in the presence of COPD and respiratory distress. questionTrap: Many interventions are generally helpful for respiratory distress, but COPD requires special considerations.  mnemonic: COPD: Consider Oxygen Parameters Diligently.",
