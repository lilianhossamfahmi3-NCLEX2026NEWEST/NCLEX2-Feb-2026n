        "correct": "Hypotension (Systolic BP < 90 mmHg) and decreased urine output (< 30 mL/hr) are critical indicators of organ hypoperfusion in sepsis and require immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. Hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to shock and organ failure. Decreased urine output reflects impaired kidney function due to hypoperfusion.",
        "incorrect": "While an elevated white blood cell count (WBC > 12,000/mm3) and elevated heart rate (> 100 bpm) are indicative of sepsis, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension and decreased urine output. These findings support the diagnosis but do not directly reflect end-organ damage. Supplemental oxygen at 2L/min is a supportive measure to improve oxygen saturation but does not address the underlying issue of hypoperfusion. It is important but not the priority.",
