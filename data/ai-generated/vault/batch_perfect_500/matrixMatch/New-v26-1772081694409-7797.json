    "correct": "The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of a stroke. Immediate interventions are crucial to minimize brain damage. Obtaining a CT scan of the head will help differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Monitoring vital signs closely is essential to detect any changes in the patient's condition.",
    "incorrect": "Administering antihypertensives without knowing the type of stroke could be detrimental. While blood pressure control is important, rapid reduction can worsen ischemic stroke. Initiating physical therapy is premature in the acute phase of a stroke. Physical therapy should begin after the patient is stabilized and the type of stroke is determined. Encouraging oral intake could lead to aspiration due to the patient's slurred speech and potential swallowing difficulties.",
