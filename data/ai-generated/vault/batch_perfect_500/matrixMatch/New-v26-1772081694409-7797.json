        "correct": "The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of a stroke, likely ischemic given the sudden onset. Immediate interventions are crucial to minimize brain damage. Obtaining a CT scan of the head will help differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, guiding further treatment. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration, such as thrombolytics if indicated, and fluid resuscitation to maintain cerebral perfusion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential to detect any changes in the patient's condition, particularly blood pressure and oxygen saturation, which can impact cerebral blood flow.",

Rapid blood pressure reduction can worsen ischemic stroke by reducing cerebral perfusion. While blood pressure control is important, it should be guided by stroke protocols after the type of stroke is determined. Initiating physical therapy is premature in the acute phase of a stroke. Physical therapy should begin after the patient is stabilized and the type of stroke is determined. Encouraging oral intake could lead to aspiration due to the patient's slurred speech and potential swallowing difficulties. A swallowing assessment should be performed first.",
