    "incorrect": "Administering antihypertensives without knowing the type of stroke could be detrimental. While blood pressure control is important, rapid reduction can worsen ischemic stroke. Initiating physical therapy is premature in the acute phase of a stroke. Physical therapy should begin after the patient is stabilized and the type of stroke is determined.
