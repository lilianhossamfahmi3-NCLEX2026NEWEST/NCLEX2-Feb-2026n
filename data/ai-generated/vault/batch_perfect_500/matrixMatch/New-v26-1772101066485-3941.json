    "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain and reduces intracranial pressure. Frequent neurological assessments are crucial to detect any changes in the client's condition. Monitoring fluid balance helps prevent fluid overload, which can increase intracranial pressure. Administering prescribed pain medication ensures client comfort and reduces stress, which can elevate intracranial pressure. Implementing seizure precautions is important as craniotomy increases the risk of seizures.",
    "incorrect": "Suctioning can increase intracranial pressure and should only be performed when necessary and with caution. Clustering nursing activities can increase intracranial pressure due to increased stimulation. Encouraging coughing can increase intracranial pressure and should be avoided. Restricting fluids can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can negatively impact neurological function. Administering stool softeners helps prevent straining during bowel movements, which can increase intracranial pressure.",
