His pain is reported as 3/10 at the incision site. Vital signs are stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air, and Temp 37.0°C. The incision dressing is dry and intact. He denies any nausea or vomiting. He is able to move all extremities equally. The current orders include continuous cardiac monitoring, neurological assessments every 2 hours, and pain medication as needed. He has a history of hypertension, managed with medication. He is tolerating clear liquids well. The Foley catheter is in place and draining clear yellow urine. He denies any headache or visual disturbances at this time.",

        "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing intracranial pressure (ICP). Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., pupillary response, motor strength, level of consciousness) are crucial to detect any changes in the client's condition, indicating increased ICP or neurological deficits. Monitoring fluid balance helps prevent fluid overload, which can exacerbate cerebral edema and increase ICP. Administering prescribed pain medication ensures client comfort and reduces stress, which can elevate ICP. Implementing seizure precautions is important as craniotomy increases the risk of seizures due to brain tissue manipulation.",
        "incorrect": "Suctioning can increase ICP and should only be performed when necessary and with caution, using brief periods and monitoring the client's response. Clustering nursing activities can increase ICP due to increased stimulation; spacing out activities allows for periods of rest and recovery. Encouraging coughing can increase ICP and should be avoided; instead, encourage deep breathing exercises without forceful coughing. Restricting fluids can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can negatively impact neurological function and cerebral perfusion. Administering stool softeners helps prevent straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver), which can increase ICP.",
