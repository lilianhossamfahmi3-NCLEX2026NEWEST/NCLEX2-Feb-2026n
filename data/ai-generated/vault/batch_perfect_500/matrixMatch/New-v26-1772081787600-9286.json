    "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. Key findings supporting sepsis include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, elevated WBC count, elevated lactate, and altered mental status. Procalcitonin is a marker specific for bacterial infections and is often elevated in sepsis.",
