    "correct": "Elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial damage, a hallmark of acute MI. Shortness of breath and decreased SpO2 can occur in both acute MI and heart failure. Elevated BNP is a key indicator of heart failure, reflecting increased ventricular stretch. Chest pain is a primary symptom of acute MI. Tachycardia can be present in both conditions as the body attempts to compensate for decreased cardiac output. ST-segment elevation on ECG is a specific sign of acute MI.",

    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the specific indicators for each condition can lead to inappropriate interventions. For example, attributing elevated BNP solely to acute MI could delay the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. Conversely, overlooking ST-segment elevation could lead to delayed reperfusion therapy for the acute MI. The nurse must synthesize data from various sources to differentiate and manage these conditions effectively.",

He experienced substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm at home this morning. He took aspirin 325mg prior to arrival. A: On assessment at 03:15, his BP was 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I level is elevated at 2.5 ng/mL. He is diaphoretic and anxious. He received morphine 4mg IV at 03:20 for pain, which is now rated 6/10. Current time is 03:30. R: Continue cardiac monitoring, administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 95%, and anticipate orders for further interventions and medications related to his acute MI and potential heart failure development due to myocardial damage. Monitor urine output closely.",
