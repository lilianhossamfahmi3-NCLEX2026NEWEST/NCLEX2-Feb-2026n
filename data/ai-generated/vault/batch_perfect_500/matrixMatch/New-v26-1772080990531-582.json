            "CKD": "While the patient has risk factors for CKD (hypertension and diabetes), the rapid onset of symptoms and significant changes in lab values point towards an acute process. GFR < 60 for 3 months is needed to diagnose CKD. The anemia is also more consistent with CKD. The patient's chronic conditions contribute to their overall risk but do not definitively confirm CKD based on the limited information.",
