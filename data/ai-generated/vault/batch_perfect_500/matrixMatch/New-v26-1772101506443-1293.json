        "correct": "Right-sided heart failure leads to systemic fluid retention, causing edema and JVD. Left-sided heart failure leads to pulmonary congestion, causing crackles and shortness of breath. Crackles are caused by fluid accumulation in the alveoli due to increased pulmonary venous pressure. Jugular venous distention (JVD) occurs due to increased central venous pressure from the heart's inability to effectively pump blood forward, leading to backflow into the venous system. Lower extremity edema is a result of increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, forcing fluid into the interstitial space.",
