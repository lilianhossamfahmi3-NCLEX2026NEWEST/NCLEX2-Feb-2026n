        "correct": "Significant bradycardia (HR < 60) in a hypothyroid patient can indicate severe disease and increased risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure. This requires immediate intervention, possibly including holding the levothyroxine dose and notifying the physician. The decreased thyroid hormone levels affect the sinoatrial node, reducing its firing rate and leading to bradycardia. Severe bradycardia compromises cardiac output, potentially causing hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.",

        "incorrect": "Fatigue is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, but not an immediate threat. While fatigue significantly impacts the patient's quality of life, it does not pose an immediate physiological risk. Addressing fatigue involves long-term management strategies such as optimizing thyroid hormone replacement therapy and lifestyle adjustments. Constipation is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, but not an immediate threat. Reduced gastrointestinal motility due to decreased thyroid hormone levels leads to constipation. While uncomfortable, it does not require immediate intervention. Cool skin is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, but not an immediate threat. Decreased metabolic rate results in reduced heat production, leading to cool skin. This symptom is managed with thyroid hormone replacement. TSH of 15 is elevated, confirming diagnosis, but not immediately life threatening. An elevated TSH confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, indicating that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone. While important for diagnosis and long-term management, it does not require immediate intervention.",
