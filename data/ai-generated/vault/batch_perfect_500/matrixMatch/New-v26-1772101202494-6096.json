The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The child is anxious and using accessory muscles to breathe. The nurse is preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment.",

        "correct": "Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist that causes bronchodilation, which helps to open the airways and improve airflow. This will decrease wheezing and improve oxygen saturation. Administering nebulized albuterol is the priority intervention to manage acute asthma exacerbation.",
        "mnemonic": "ABC - Albuterol Before Comfort (address airway before comfort measures)",
        "incorrect": "While monitoring vital signs is important for assessing the child's condition, it does not directly address the immediate need for bronchodilation. Oxygen administration is important to improve oxygen saturation, but albuterol is needed to open the airways. Positioning the child upright may help with breathing, but it is not the primary intervention to address bronchoconstriction.",
        "questionTrap": "The question focuses on the immediate action to address the child's respiratory distress, making albuterol the priority over other supportive measures. Recognizing the need for bronchodilation is key.",

            "Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) used for acute asthma exacerbations to provide quick relief.",
