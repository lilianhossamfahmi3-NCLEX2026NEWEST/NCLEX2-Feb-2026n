Peripheral edema results from systemic venous congestion, characteristic of right-sided heart failure. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in both types of heart failure. Hyponatremia can occur due to fluid overload and dilution, common in both conditions. \n\nclinicalPearl: BNP levels correlate with the severity of heart failure.
