    "correct": "Administering a fluid bolus is indicated to address the patient's hypotension, which is a key sign of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Monitoring urine output hourly is crucial for assessing the patient's renal function and response to fluid resuscitation. Continuing antibiotics as ordered is essential to combat the suspected infection driving the sepsis. Initiating vasopressors is indicated if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation; the current BP of 88/50 suggests this may be necessary soon.",

    "incorrect": "Administering an anti-diarrheal is contraindicated because the patient has not had diarrhea; the SBAR notes constipation. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis as the patient is hypotensive and requires fluid resuscitation to improve tissue perfusion. Discontinuing antibiotics is contraindicated as the patient has a suspected infection and the antibiotics are crucial for treatment.

B: Since 10:00, staff have noted increased confusion and decreased urine output. His current vital signs are: Temperature 38.9°C, Heart Rate 110 bpm, Respiratory Rate 28 breaths/min, Blood Pressure 88/50 mmHg, and SpO2 91% on 2L nasal cannula. A: The primary concern is possible sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Recent blood cultures have been ordered, and we are awaiting the results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin & Cefepime) were initiated at 11:00. The patient's lactate level is 3.5 mmol/L, and he is alert and oriented to person and place. R: The patient requires close monitoring, particularly of his blood pressure and urine output. A fluid bolus may be necessary due to persistent hypotension. Continue administering antibiotics as prescribed. Monitor urine output hourly and report any signs of deterioration to the provider immediately. His last bowel movement was three days ago. A Foley catheter was inserted at 11:30, yielding 30mL of amber urine. The current time is 12:00.",
