        "correct": "Administering a fluid bolus is indicated to address the patient's hypotension, a key sign of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. The goal is to increase intravascular volume and improve blood pressure. Monitoring urine output hourly is crucial for assessing renal function and response to fluid resuscitation; decreased output may indicate inadequate perfusion or acute kidney injury. Continuing antibiotics as ordered is essential to combat the suspected infection driving the sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated to cover likely pathogens. Initiating vasopressors is indicated if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation. A blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg suggests this may be necessary soon to maintain adequate organ perfusion.",

        "incorrect": "Administering an anti-diarrheal is contraindicated because the patient has not had diarrhea; the SBAR notes constipation. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis as the patient is hypotensive and requires fluid resuscitation to improve tissue perfusion. Discontinuing antibiotics is contraindicated as the patient has a suspected infection, and the antibiotics are crucial for treatment. Delaying vasopressors is contraindicated if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation, as this can lead to end-organ damage.",
