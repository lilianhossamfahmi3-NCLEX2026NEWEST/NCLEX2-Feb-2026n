    "incorrect": "Stable or worsening lab values (e.g., increased creatinine, decreased GFR), persistent signs of dehydration (e.g., poor skin turgor), or signs of fluid overload (e.g., edema, crackles in lungs) would indicate a decline in the client's condition. Stable vital signs within normal limits do not automatically indicate improvement or decline but must be considered in the context of the other assessment findings. Stable Potassium level, when previously elevated, is a positive sign not 'no change'.",
