        "correct": "Administering oxygen supports oxygenation in the setting of blood loss, preventing hypoxia and ensuring adequate tissue perfusion. Initiating a rapid response ensures timely intervention by a multidisciplinary team, facilitating prompt management of the hemorrhage. Starting an IV infusion of crystalloid fluids helps to restore intravascular volume, counteracting hypovolemia caused by blood loss. Preparing to administer blood products addresses the blood loss and prevents further hemodynamic instability. Elevating the client's legs promotes venous return and helps to increase blood pressure, improving circulation to vital organs. These actions are crucial in stabilizing the client and preventing further complications from postpartum hemorrhage.",
        "incorrect": "Fundal massage has already been attempted and was ineffective, indicating the need for further interventions. Monitoring vital signs is important, but not the priority action; immediate interventions are needed to stabilize the client. Documenting findings is important, but not the priority action; interventions to stop the hemorrhage take precedence. Encouraging the client to void is not the priority action in the setting of hemorrhage; addressing the bleeding is the priority. Applying ice to the perineum addresses pain and swelling, not hemorrhage; it does not address the underlying cause of the bleeding.",
