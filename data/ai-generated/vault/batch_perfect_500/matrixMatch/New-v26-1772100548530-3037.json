Chief complaint is increased work of breathing.\n\nBackground: Alex has a known history of asthma, managed with a rescue inhaler at home. He has had several exacerbations in the past, typically triggered by viral infections.\n\nAssessment: Current assessment reveals audible wheezing, a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. He is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals decreased air entry bilaterally.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend administering albuterol via nebulizer, initiating oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%, and considering oral prednisone to address airway inflammation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is essential.",

It works by causing bronchodilation, which opens the airways and improves airflow, thereby alleviating wheezing and respiratory distress. The rapid onset of action makes it ideal for immediate relief.",
        "incorrect": "While anticholinergics like ipratropium can be used in conjunction with albuterol for additive bronchodilation, they are not the first-line treatment for immediate relief of bronchospasm. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are crucial for reducing airway inflammation in asthma exacerbations, but their onset of action is delayed (hours), making them unsuitable for immediate relief. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of a bacterial infection, which is not suggested by the current assessment findings.",
