        "incorrect": "While elevated white blood cell count, elevated heart rate, and elevated temperature are indicative of sepsis, they do not require immediate intervention in the same way that hypotension and decreased urine output do. These findings should be addressed promptly, but after the more critical findings. Addressing the underlying infection with antibiotics is crucial, but not the immediate priority when perfusion is compromised.",
