Clinical signs and symptoms supporting sepsis often include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and altered mental status.  While edema can be present, it is not specific to sepsis. Hypertension is a risk factor, but hypotension is more specific to sepsis.",

Normal lab values, stable vital signs, or patient history alone (without acute changes) would not support sepsis.
