    "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. Clinical signs and symptoms supporting sepsis often include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and altered mental status.  While edema can be present, it is not specific to sepsis. Hypertension is a risk factor but hypotension is more specific to sepsis. ",
    "incorrect": "Some findings may be common in other conditions or are simply unrelated to the systemic inflammatory response characteristic of sepsis. Normal lab values, stable vital signs, or patient history alone (without acute changes) would not support sepsis. Edema can result from many different underlying conditions, so is not very specific to sepsis.",
