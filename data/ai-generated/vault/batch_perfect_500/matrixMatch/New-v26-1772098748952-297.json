        "correct": "Fatigue, weight gain, and constipation are classic symptoms of hypothyroidism due to decreased metabolic rate. Bradycardia is also a common finding due to the slowed metabolic processes affecting the cardiovascular system. Cold intolerance is due to decreased thermogenesis, as thyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating body temperature. Dry skin is due to decreased sweat and oil production, resulting from reduced metabolic activity in the skin cells. These symptoms collectively point towards a deficiency in thyroid hormone production.",
        "mnemonic": "SLOW: Sleepiness, Lethargy, Obesity, Weakness (muscle)",
        "incorrect": "Tachycardia, heat intolerance, and diarrhea are more commonly associated with hyperthyroidism, where there is an excess of thyroid hormone. Increased appetite can be associated with hyperthyroidism or other conditions, but is not a primary symptom of hypothyroidism, which typically leads to decreased appetite due to a slower metabolic rate. Moist skin is not typically associated with hypothyroidism; instead, dry skin is a hallmark symptom.",
