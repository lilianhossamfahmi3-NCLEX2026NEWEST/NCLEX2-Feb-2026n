        "correct": "Administering oxygen supports oxygenation in the setting of blood loss, preventing hypoxia and supporting vital organ function. Initiating a rapid response ensures timely intervention by a multidisciplinary team to manage the hemorrhage effectively. Preparing for blood transfusion addresses potential blood loss and hemodynamic instability, preventing hypovolemic shock. Starting an IV with a large-bore catheter allows for rapid fluid and medication administration, crucial for stabilizing the client's condition.",

        "incorrect": "Fundal massage was already attempted and was ineffective, indicating the need for other interventions. Elevating the legs may help with venous return, but is not the priority in this acute situation. Monitoring vital signs is important, but active intervention is needed to address the underlying cause. Documenting findings is important, but should not be prioritized over immediate life-saving interventions.",
        "questionTrap": "The question requires prioritizing interventions based on the client's unstable condition. While some options are helpful, the correct answers directly address the immediate threat to the client's life by improving oxygenation, initiating a rapid response, preparing for blood transfusion, and ensuring IV access.",
