Auscultation reveals significant wheezing bilaterally. He is alert and oriented but appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. 14:15, P: I am preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment as per protocol. I have also ordered continuous SpO2 monitoring and will reassess his respiratory status after the treatment. Considering obtaining a chest X-ray if there is no improvement.",

        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min in a 6-year-old child is significantly elevated, indicating respiratory distress and the need for immediate intervention to improve ventilation. An oxygen saturation of 90% on room air is below the acceptable range for a child with asthma and signifies hypoxemia, necessitating immediate oxygen supplementation. Wheezing is an expected finding in asthma exacerbation due to bronchoconstriction, but it also indicates airway obstruction that requires intervention. While being alert and oriented is a positive sign, it does not negate the need to address the respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The priority is to improve oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nclinicalPearl: Continuous monitoring of respiratory status, including respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, is crucial in managing pediatric asthma exacerbations. Early intervention can prevent respiratory failure.\nquestionTrap: Do not be misled by the child's alertness; focus on the physiological parameters indicating respiratory compromise.\nmnemonic: \"RR and SpO2 need to be >94!\"",
        "incorrect": "Wheezing is an expected finding in asthma exacerbations due to bronchoconstriction, but it also indicates airway obstruction that requires intervention. However, in the context of other more critical findings, it is not the priority. Alertness and orientation are positive findings, but they do not negate the need for intervention for respiratory distress. The respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are more concerning. A respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min in a 6-year-old is significantly elevated, indicating respiratory distress and the need for immediate intervention to improve ventilation.
