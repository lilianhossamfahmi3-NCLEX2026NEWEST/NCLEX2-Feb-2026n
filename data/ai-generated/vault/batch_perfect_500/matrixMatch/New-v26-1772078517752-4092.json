Maintaining adequate oxygen saturation is crucial for brain tissue perfusion in the setting of a possible stroke. Rapid blood pressure control and oxygen administration are vital to minimize brain injury.",

        "incorrect": "While a heart rate of 90 bpm is within normal limits and does not require immediate intervention in this context of acute stroke symptoms and elevated blood pressure, continuous monitoring is important. A respiratory rate of 24 is elevated, but in the context of acute stroke, it may be compensatory. Ensuring adequate oxygenation (SpO2) is more critical. While assessment of neurological deficits is important, it does not require immediate intervention beyond continuous monitoring. Pending labs and radiology are important but do not require immediate intervention.",
