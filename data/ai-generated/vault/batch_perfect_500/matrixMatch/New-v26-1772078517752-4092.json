A respiratory rate of 24 is elevated, but in the context of acute stroke, it may be compensatory. Ensuring adequate oxygenation (SpO2) is more critical. While assessment of neurological deficits is important, it does not require immediate intervention beyond continuous monitoring. Pending labs and radiology are important but do not require immediate intervention.",
