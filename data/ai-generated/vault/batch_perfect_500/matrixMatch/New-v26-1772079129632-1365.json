    "correct": "The patient's presentation, including moon face, buffalo hump, abdominal striae, elevated cortisol levels (with suppressed ACTH), hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia strongly suggest Cushing's syndrome. The elevated sodium and low potassium also support this diagnosis.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Addison's disease typically presents with hyperpigmentation, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, which are not present in this patient. While the patient experiences fatigue, weight gain, and hypertension, these are not the primary indicators of Addison's disease.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "whyItIsWrong": "While the cortisol is within the normal range, the fact that ACTH is suppressed indicates that the adrenal glands are producing cortisol independently of ACTH stimulation, which is highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome (specifically ACTH-independent Cushing's).",
      "commonMistake": "Misinterpreting the 'normal' cortisol level as ruling out Cushing's syndrome, without considering the suppressed ACTH level."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which can lead to a variety of symptoms including weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump, and hypertension.",
      "ACTH levels can help differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. Suppressed ACTH in the presence of elevated cortisol suggests an adrenal tumor.",
