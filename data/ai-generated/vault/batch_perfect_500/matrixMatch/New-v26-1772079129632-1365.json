        "correct": "The patient's presentation, including moon face, buffalo hump, abdominal striae, elevated cortisol levels (with suppressed ACTH), hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia strongly suggest Cushing's syndrome. The elevated sodium and low potassium also support this diagnosis. These findings indicate excessive cortisol production, leading to mineralocorticoid effects and altered glucose metabolism.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Addison's disease typically presents with hyperpigmentation, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, which are not present in this patient. While the patient experiences fatigue, weight gain, and hypertension, these are not the primary indicators of Addison's disease. Addison's is caused by adrenal insufficiency, leading to decreased cortisol and aldosterone production.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "whyItIsWrong": "While the cortisol is within the normal range, the fact that ACTH is suppressed indicates that the adrenal glands are producing cortisol independently of ACTH stimulation, which is highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome (specifically ACTH-independent Cushing's). This autonomous cortisol production overrides the normal feedback mechanisms.",
            "commonMistake": "Misinterpreting the 'normal' cortisol level as ruling out Cushing's syndrome, without considering the suppressed ACTH level. Always consider the interplay between cortisol and ACTH levels in endocrine disorders."

            "ACTH levels can help differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. Suppressed ACTH in the presence of elevated cortisol suggests an adrenal tumor.",
            "Hypokalemia is a common finding in Cushing's syndrome due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects, leading to increased potassium excretion.",
