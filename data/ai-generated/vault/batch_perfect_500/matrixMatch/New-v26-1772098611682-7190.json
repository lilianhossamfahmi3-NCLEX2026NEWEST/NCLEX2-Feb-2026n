The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The child is anxious and using accessory muscles to breathe. The nurse is preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment. Which assessment findings require immediate action or notification of the healthcare provider?",
