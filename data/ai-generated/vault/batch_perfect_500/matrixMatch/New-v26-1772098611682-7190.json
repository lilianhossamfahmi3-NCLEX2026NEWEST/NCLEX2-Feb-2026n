The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The child is anxious and using accessory muscles to breathe. The nurse is preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment. Which assessment findings require immediate action or notification of the healthcare provider?",

        "correct": "Increased respiratory rate (tachypnea), low oxygen saturation (hypoxemia), and the use of accessory muscles are key indicators of respiratory distress and impending respiratory failure in a child with asthma. Immediate intervention is required to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Anxiety further exacerbates respiratory distress, increasing oxygen demand and respiratory effort; thus, it requires immediate attention to reduce the child's distress and improve breathing.",
        "mnemonic": "ABC- Airway, Breathing, Circulation. In respiratory distress, prioritize interventions to support breathing and oxygenation before addressing other concerns.",
        "incorrect": "While an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) is expected in respiratory distress as the body attempts to compensate for hypoxemia, it is not the priority. Preparing to administer albuterol is a correct action, but it does not negate the need to address the underlying respiratory distress. The child's age is relevant for medication dosing and developmental considerations but is not an immediate concern in this acute situation.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may focus on the elevated heart rate or the fact that albuterol is being prepared, but the key is to identify the signs of significant respiratory distress that require immediate attention. Overlooking accessory muscle use or low oxygen saturation can lead to incorrect prioritization.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Early recognition of respiratory distress in children with asthma is crucial to prevent respiratory failure and the need for intubation.",
            "Accessory muscle use, such as nasal flaring and intercostal retractions, is a late sign of respiratory distress, indicating significant respiratory compromise."
