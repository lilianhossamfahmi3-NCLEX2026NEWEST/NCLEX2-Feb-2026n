        "correct": "Elevated BNP, S3 gallop, pulmonary congestion, pitting edema, and elevated heart rate are all signs of heart failure. An S3 gallop is specifically associated with volume overload in both HFrEF and HFpEF. Elevated BNP suggests heart failure due to ventricular stretching. Pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly visible on chest x-ray are consistent with fluid overload caused by heart failure. Pitting edema in lower extremities is also a sign of fluid overload, indicative of both types of heart failure. Elevated heart rate is common in both types of heart failure as the body attempts to compensate for decreased cardiac output. JVD is common in both types of heart failure due to fluid overload.",
