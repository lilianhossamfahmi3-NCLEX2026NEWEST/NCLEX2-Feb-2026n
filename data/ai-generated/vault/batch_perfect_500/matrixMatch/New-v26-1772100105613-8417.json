The child's respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. The child is anxious and using accessory muscles to breathe. The nurse is preparing to administer a nebulized albuterol treatment. Which assessment findings require immediate action or notification of the healthcare provider?",

        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and the use of accessory muscles are critical indicators of significant respiratory distress in a child with asthma exacerbation. These findings suggest inadequate oxygenation and increased work of breathing, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential respiratory failure. Prompt action, such as administering supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators, is essential to improve the child's respiratory status. The healthcare provider should be notified immediately to evaluate the need for further interventions, such as corticosteroids or continuous nebulization.",
        "incorrect": "While anxiety and an elevated heart rate of 120 beats per minute are expected findings in a child experiencing respiratory distress, they are secondary to the primary problem of inadequate oxygenation and increased work of breathing. Addressing the respiratory distress will likely alleviate the anxiety and, to some extent, the elevated heart rate. The focus should be on the parameters that directly reflect the child's respiratory function and oxygenation status.",
