        "correct": "Maintaining a neutral head position promotes venous drainage from the brain and reduces intracranial pressure (ICP). Elevating the head of the bed 30-45 degrees is also helpful, but neutral positioning prevents neck flexion which can impede venous return. Frequent neurological assessments are essential for early detection of changes indicating complications such as increased ICP or bleeding. Administering prescribed pain medication helps manage pain, preventing increases in ICP due to pain-related stress. Monitoring fluid balance helps prevent fluid overload or dehydration, both of which can affect ICP. Implementing seizure precautions is important because craniotomy increases the risk of seizures due to brain tissue manipulation. \n\n<b>clinicalPearl:</b> Subtle changes in neurological status (e.g., restlessness, subtle changes in speech) can be early indicators of increased ICP. Prompt intervention is crucial.\n\n<b>mnemonic:</b> NEURO: Neutral head, Evaluate neuro status, Use pain meds, Regulate fluids, Observe for seizures.",
        "incorrect": "Encouraging coughing and deep breathing can increase intracranial pressure and should be done cautiously, if at all, after a craniotomy. While respiratory interventions are important, they must be carefully managed to avoid increasing ICP. Clustering care can increase intracranial pressure due to increased stimulation and should be avoided, especially in the acute post-operative phase. Restricting fluids is not typically indicated unless there is evidence of fluid overload or increased intracranial pressure; maintaining euvolemia is the goal.\n\n<b>questionTrap:</b> Selecting interventions that are generally beneficial but potentially harmful in the context of increased ICP is a common trap. Focus on interventions that directly mitigate the risk of increased ICP.",
