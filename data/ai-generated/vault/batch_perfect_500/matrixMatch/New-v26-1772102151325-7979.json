    "correct": "Maintaining a neutral head position promotes venous drainage from the brain and reduces intracranial pressure. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes that may indicate complications. Administering prescribed pain medication helps manage pain and prevent increases in intracranial pressure due to pain-related stress. Monitoring fluid balance helps prevent fluid overload or dehydration, both of which can affect intracranial pressure. Implementing seizure precautions is important because craniotomy increases the risk of seizures.",
    "incorrect": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees is appropriate, but a neutral head position is more specific and important. While monitoring vital signs is important, neurological status is more directly related to the post-operative craniotomy. Encouraging coughing and deep breathing can increase intracranial pressure and should be done cautiously, if at all, after a craniotomy. Clustering care can increase intracranial pressure due to increased stimulation. Restricting fluids is not typically indicated unless there is evidence of fluid overload or increased intracranial pressure.",
