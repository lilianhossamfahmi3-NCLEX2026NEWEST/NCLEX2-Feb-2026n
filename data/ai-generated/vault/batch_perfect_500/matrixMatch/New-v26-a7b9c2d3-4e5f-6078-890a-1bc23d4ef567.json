Administering morphine sulfate helps to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance, breaking the cycle of the tet spell. Providing supplemental oxygen can help increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, improving oxygen saturation. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used to prevent tet spells by decreasing heart rate and contractility, reducing oxygen demand. Administering propranolol at the prescribed dose is indicated to prevent further tet spells.",

        "incorrect": "Increasing IV fluid rate may worsen pulmonary congestion, a potential complication in infants with congenital heart defects. While hydration is important, the rapid infusion could exacerbate existing cardiac strain. Placing the infant supine during a tet spell can worsen oxygenation due to increased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The knee-chest position is preferred. Increasing stimulation will likely worsen the tet spell by increasing oxygen demand and potentially agitating the infant.",
