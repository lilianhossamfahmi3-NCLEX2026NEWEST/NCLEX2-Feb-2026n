        "correct": "Right-sided heart failure leads to systemic fluid retention, causing edema and jugular venous distention. The increased systemic venous pressure causes fluid to leak into the tissues, resulting in peripheral edema. Jugular venous distention occurs due to the elevated right atrial pressure. Left-sided heart failure leads to pulmonary congestion, causing crackles and shortness of breath. The increased pulmonary venous pressure forces fluid into the alveoli, leading to crackles. Shortness of breath results from the impaired gas exchange. An S3 heart sound is often associated with left ventricular dysfunction, indicating increased ventricular filling pressure and volume overload.",
