    "correct": "Digoxin administration should be held due to the elevated digoxin level (1.8 ng/mL), which is within the toxic range (generally >2.0 ng/mL). The patient is also exhibiting signs of digoxin toxicity (new-onset atrial fibrillation, confusion). Furosemide can exacerbate hypokalemia, and with a potassium level already low at 3.4 mEq/L, administering Furosemide is contraindicated without addressing the potassium deficiency first. Lisinopril should be held due to the patient's elevated blood pressure. While Lisinopril is typically used for hypertension, the current BP of 165/90 mmHg indicates it is not effectively controlling his BP and could contribute to hypotension if administered now. Administering Potassium Chloride is indicated due to the patient's hypokalemia (K: 3.4 mEq/L). Hypokalemia can worsen cardiac arrhythmias and should be corrected.",

    "incorrect": "Administering Digoxin with an elevated level can lead to severe toxicity, including life-threatening arrhythmias. Administering Furosemide without correcting the potassium level could worsen the hypokalemia, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Administering Lisinopril, when the blood pressure is already elevated, may not be the priority and the elevated BP needs to be addressed first. Holding Potassium Chloride with a low potassium level can lead to further complications related to hypokalemia, including arrhythmias and muscle weakness.",

    "sbar": "S: Mr. Jones, a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, was admitted for pneumonia. He has a known penicillin allergy. R: The patient has exhibited increasing confusion since 02:00 this morning. His blood pressure was elevated to 170/95 mmHg at 04:00. He is also experiencing a new onset of atrial fibrillation. O: Currently 06:00, the patient is alert but disoriented to place and time. His respiratory rate is 24, and his oxygen saturation is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. New onset atrial fibrillation is noted on the cardiac monitor, with a rate of 110. Lab results show hypokalemia and elevated glucose. Digoxin level is elevated. A: Potential medication interactions and adverse effects are contributing to altered mental status and the new arrhythmia. The elevated digoxin level and electrolyte imbalance are concerning. We are requesting clarification on medication orders and guidance on the patient's management, particularly regarding digoxin, furosemide, and potassium replacement. Need to address the elevated blood pressure and atrial fibrillation.",
