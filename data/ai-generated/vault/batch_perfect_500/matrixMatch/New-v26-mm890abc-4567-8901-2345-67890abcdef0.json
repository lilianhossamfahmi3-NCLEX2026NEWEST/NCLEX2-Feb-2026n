        "correct": "Digoxin administration is contraindicated due to the elevated digoxin level (1.8 ng/mL), which is within the toxic range (generally > 2.0 ng/mL). The patient is also exhibiting signs of digoxin toxicity, including new-onset atrial fibrillation and confusion. Furosemide is contraindicated because it can exacerbate hypokalemia, and the patient's potassium level is already low at 3.4 mEq/L. Administering Furosemide without addressing the potassium deficiency first could lead to dangerous arrhythmias. Lisinopril is contraindicated due to the patient's elevated blood pressure of 165/90 mmHg. While Lisinopril is typically used for hypertension, the current BP indicates it is not effectively controlling his BP and could contribute to hypotension if administered now. Potassium Chloride administration is indicated due to the patient's hypokalemia (K: 3.4 mEq/L). Hypokalemia can worsen cardiac arrhythmias and should be corrected to prevent further complications.",

        "incorrect": "Administering Digoxin with an elevated level can lead to severe toxicity, including life-threatening arrhythmias. Administering Furosemide without correcting the potassium level could worsen the hypokalemia, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Administering Lisinopril when the blood pressure is already elevated may not be the priority, and the elevated BP needs to be addressed first. Holding Potassium Chloride with a low potassium level can lead to further complications related to hypokalemia, including arrhythmias and muscle weakness.",
