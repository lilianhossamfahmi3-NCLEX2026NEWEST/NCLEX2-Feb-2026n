The child is experiencing increased work of breathing, audible wheezing, and a non-productive cough. The parents report that the child has been using their albuterol inhaler every 2 hours for the past 24 hours with minimal relief. Vital signs are as follows: Heart rate 140 bpm, Respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, Oxygen saturation 90% on room air, Temperature 37.2°C (99°F).",
