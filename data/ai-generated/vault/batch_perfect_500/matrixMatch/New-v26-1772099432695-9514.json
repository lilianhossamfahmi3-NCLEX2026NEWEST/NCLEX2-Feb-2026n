The child is experiencing increased work of breathing, audible wheezing, and a non-productive cough. The parents report that the child has been using their albuterol inhaler every 2 hours for the past 24 hours with minimal relief. Vital signs are as follows: Heart rate 140 bpm, Respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, Oxygen saturation 90% on room air, Temperature 37.2°C (99°F).",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The child is experiencing an asthma exacerbation and requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and reduce airway inflammation. Administering oxygen will increase the SpO2. Albuterol via nebulizer acts as a bronchodilator, relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways and improving airflow. Oral prednisone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing further constriction and promoting easier breathing. These interventions address the underlying pathophysiology of asthma exacerbation.",
        "mnemonic": "OBA - Oxygen, Bronchodilator, Anti-inflammatory (Corticosteroid)",
        "incorrect": "While monitoring vital signs is important, it does not address the immediate need for improved oxygenation and bronchodilation. Waiting for arterial blood gas results delays necessary interventions and can lead to further respiratory distress. Administering an antihistamine is not indicated for asthma exacerbation as histamine is not a primary mediator in asthma.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps are options that address only one aspect of the problem or delay necessary interventions, potentially leading to a worsening of the patient's condition.",
