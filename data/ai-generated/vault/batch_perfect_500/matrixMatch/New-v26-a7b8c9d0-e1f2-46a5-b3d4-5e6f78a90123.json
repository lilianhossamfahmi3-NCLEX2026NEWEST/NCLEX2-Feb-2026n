        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed is crucial to decrease cerebral blood pressure and mitigate the risk of stroke. Assessing for bladder distension is a priority because a full bladder is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Checking for bowel impaction by performing a digital rectal exam (with anesthetic lubricant due to potential for stimulation) is also important, as bowel impaction is another frequent trigger. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes allows for close observation of the patient's response to interventions and early detection of further deterioration. Administering antihypertensive medication as prescribed is essential to control the elevated blood pressure and prevent complications. \n\nclinicalPearl: Remember to use anesthetic lubricant during digital rectal exam to minimize stimulation and prevent exacerbation of autonomic dysreflexia.",

        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker without a specific order and without knowing the patient's full medication history is dangerous due to the potential for precipitous drop in blood pressure and bradycardia, especially in a patient with an already low heart rate. This could exacerbate the situation. Placing the patient in a supine position would increase cerebral blood pressure and worsen the hypertensive crisis. Waiting for further orders before initiating any interventions would delay crucial treatment and potentially lead to severe complications such as stroke or seizure.\n\nclinicalPearl: Beta-blockers can worsen bradycardia, a common finding in autonomic dysreflexia. Always assess heart rate before administration.\n\nquestionTrap: Test takers might be tempted to administer a beta-blocker to lower BP, overlooking the risk of bradycardia and the need for a direct-acting antihypertensive.",
