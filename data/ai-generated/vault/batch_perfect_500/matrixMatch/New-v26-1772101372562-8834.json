        "correct": "Right-sided heart failure leads to systemic fluid retention, causing edema and JVD. The increased systemic venous pressure results in fluid extravasation into tissues, leading to peripheral edema. Jugular vein distention occurs due to elevated right atrial pressure. Left-sided heart failure leads to pulmonary congestion, causing crackles and shortness of breath. The impaired left ventricular function causes blood to back up into the pulmonary circulation, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs. Hypertension can contribute to both by increasing the workload on the heart.",
