        "correct": "Hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg) indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent shock and organ damage. Decreased urine output (10 mL/hr) suggests kidney hypoperfusion, requiring prompt action to preserve renal function. Rapid intervention can prevent progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.",

Background: Patient has a history of pneumonia treated 2 weeks ago. He reports feeling weak and unwell for the past 2 days. Assessment: Suspect sepsis due to current presentation and recent infection. Patient's blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg, urine output is 10 mL/hr, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. Labs show elevated WBC count. Recommendation: Initiate sepsis protocol immediately, including fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. Consider vasopressors if hypotension persists.",
