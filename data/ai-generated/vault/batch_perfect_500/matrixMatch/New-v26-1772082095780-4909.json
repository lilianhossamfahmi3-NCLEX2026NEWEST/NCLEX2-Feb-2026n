        "correct": "Positioning the patient upright during meals reduces the risk of aspiration by utilizing gravity to aid in swallowing. Consulting with speech therapy is essential for a comprehensive swallowing evaluation and individualized recommendations. Providing thickened liquids slows the flow rate, allowing the patient more control and reducing aspiration risk. Monitoring for coughing, choking, or wet vocal quality are key indicators of aspiration. These interventions collectively ensure patient safety and promote effective swallowing.",

Thin liquids are more difficult to control and increase aspiration risk. Ignoring signs of respiratory distress could result in aspiration pneumonia. These actions can lead to severe respiratory complications and should be avoided.",

Currently on aspirin and antihypertensives.\nAssessment: Patient is alert but weak on his right side with difficulty swallowing. Oxygen saturation is stable at 96% on room air.
