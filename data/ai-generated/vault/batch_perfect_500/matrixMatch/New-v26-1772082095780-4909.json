    "correct": "Positioning the patient upright during meals reduces the risk of aspiration by utilizing gravity to aid in swallowing. Consulting with speech therapy is essential for a comprehensive swallowing evaluation and individualized recommendations. Providing thickened liquids slows the flow rate, allowing the patient more control and reducing aspiration risk. Monitoring for coughing, choking, or wet vocal quality are key indicators of aspiration.",
