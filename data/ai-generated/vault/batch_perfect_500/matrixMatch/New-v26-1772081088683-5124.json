An S3 heart sound indicates rapid ventricular filling, often associated with LSHF. Right-sided heart failure (RSHF) results in systemic venous congestion, causing jugular venous distention (JVD), peripheral edema, and hepatomegaly. Elevated BNP levels support a diagnosis of heart failure, as BNP is released in response to ventricular stretching, regardless of the affected side.",
