        "correct": "A boggy fundus and excessive lochia with clots are indicative of uterine atony, a major cause of PPH. Tachycardia and hypotension are signs of hypovolemia due to blood loss. Pallor and diaphoresis are also signs of hypovolemia. Uterine atony prevents the uterus from contracting effectively to clamp down on blood vessels at the placental site, leading to continued bleeding. Increased heart rate is the body's attempt to compensate for decreased blood volume, while hypotension reflects the failure to maintain adequate perfusion.",

        "incorrect": "While a fundus located 2 cm above the umbilicus is normal in the immediate postpartum period, a *boggy* fundus is not. Mild perineal edema is common after vaginal delivery due to tissue trauma during delivery. A temperature of 37.2 is within normal limits. Platelet count of 250 is within normal limits. A firm fundus indicates proper uterine contraction, reducing the risk of hemorrhage. Mild perineal edema is a common and expected finding in the early postpartum period as tissues recover. A normal temperature indicates no infection, and a normal platelet count rules out thrombocytopenia as a cause of bleeding.",
