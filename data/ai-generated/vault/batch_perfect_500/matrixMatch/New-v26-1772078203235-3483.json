        "correct": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This patient meets criteria for sepsis due to suspected infection (UTI), elevated lactate, altered mental status, and hypotension. SIRS requires two or more of the following: temperature >38°C or <36°C, heart rate >90 bpm, respiratory rate >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg, WBC >12,000/mm3 or <4,000/mm3 or >10% bands. The patient meets SIRS criteria, but the evidence of end-organ damage (elevated lactate, altered mental status) indicates sepsis.",
