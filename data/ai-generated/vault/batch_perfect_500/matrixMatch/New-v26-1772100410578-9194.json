        "correct": "Hypotension (BP 80/50 mmHg) and decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) are critical indicators of organ hypoperfusion in sepsis, requiring immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential organ failure. Sepsis leads to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, causing decreased blood pressure. Reduced blood flow to the kidneys results in decreased urine output.",
        "incorrect": "While a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F) and an elevated heart rate (110 bpm) are consistent with sepsis, they are not as immediately life-threatening as hypotension and oliguria. A temperature elevation is an expected inflammatory response. An elevated heart rate is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. Oxygen saturation of 94% is within acceptable limits for a patient with pneumonia and does not require immediate intervention.",
