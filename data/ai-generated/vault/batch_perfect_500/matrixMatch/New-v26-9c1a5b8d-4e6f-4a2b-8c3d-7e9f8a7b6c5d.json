    "sbar": "Situation: Sergeant David Miller, a 20-year-old male, was admitted at 16:30 today following a suicide attempt with an overdose of prescribed sleeping pills. Background: Sergeant Miller is an active-duty soldier with a history of depression and PTSD following a recent deployment. He expresses feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Assessment: On admission, Sergeant Miller was somnolent but arousable. Vitals: HR 110, BP 100/60, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air. He states, \"I just want the pain to stop.\" He denies any current suicidal ideation, but his affect is flat. Risk assessment indicates high suicide risk. Recommendation: Continue close observation, initiate suicide precautions, administer prescribed medications, and provide emotional support. Engage the mental health team for ongoing evaluation and treatment planning. Contact chaplain services per patient request. Ensure a safe environment, removing any potentially harmful objects. Complete room search at 17:00. Reassess suicide risk every shift.",
