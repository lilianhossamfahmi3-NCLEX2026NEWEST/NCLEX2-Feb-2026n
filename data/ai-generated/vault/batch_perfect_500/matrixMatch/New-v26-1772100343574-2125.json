        "correct": "The priority action is to massage the fundus. A boggy, non-midline uterus indicates uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contraction, which helps to compress the blood vessels and reduce bleeding. Addressing uterine atony is crucial to prevent further blood loss and potential complications. The uterus should be massaged until it becomes firm and midline. Continuous assessment is needed to ensure the uterus remains contracted.",
        "incorrect": "Administering oxygen is important for clients experiencing significant blood loss or respiratory distress, but it is not the FIRST action in this scenario. Addressing the source of the bleeding takes priority. While oxygen may be necessary later, the immediate focus should be on controlling the hemorrhage.\n\nNotifying the healthcare provider is important, but the nurse should first attempt to resolve the issue. The nurse can notify the provider after initiating interventions to stabilize the client. Delaying intervention to notify the provider could lead to further complications.\n\nDocumenting the findings is essential for accurate record-keeping, but it should occur after interventions to address the client's condition. Immediate action to control the bleeding is the priority.",
