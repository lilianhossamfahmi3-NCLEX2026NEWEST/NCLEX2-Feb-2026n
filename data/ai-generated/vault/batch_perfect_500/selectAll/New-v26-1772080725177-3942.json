While it confirms heart failure, it doesn't reflect the immediate need for respiratory support.\nCrackles in the lungs are a common finding in heart failure due to pulmonary edema but are not as immediately life-threatening as hypoxemia. They indicate fluid overload but don't directly impair oxygen delivery to tissues as severely as hypoxemia.\nA heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated but not as critical as hypoxemia in this acute situation; other interventions addressing the heart failure itself will likely improve the heart rate. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism but doesn't pose the same immediate threat as inadequate oxygenation.",
