  "rationale": {
    "correct": "INR (International Normalized Ratio) is the MOST important lab value to monitor because it directly reflects the degree of anticoagulation achieved with warfarin. Warfarin's therapeutic effect is measured by its impact on the INR, with a target range typically between 2.0 and 3.0 for atrial fibrillation. Regular monitoring of INR allows for dosage adjustments to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation while minimizing the risk of bleeding.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "phrase": "WIN for Warfarin = INR",
      "description": "Remember to 'WIN' with Warfarin by monitoring the INR."
    },
    "incorrect": "While platelets, hemoglobin, PTT, and potassium are important lab values to monitor in general, they are not the primary indicators of warfarin's therapeutic effect or bleeding risk. Platelets and hemoglobin are relevant for assessing bleeding risk, but the INR is the direct measure of anticoagulation. PTT is used for heparin monitoring, not warfarin. Potassium levels are not directly related to warfarin's anticoagulation effects.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "reasoning": "Students should understand that while overall bleeding risk assessment is important, the INR specifically guides warfarin dosing and management.",
      "description": "This question requires prioritizing laboratory values based on their relevance to warfarin therapy. Students might be tempted to choose platelet count or hemoglobin as indicators of bleeding risk, but must recognize that INR is the direct measure of warfarin's effect."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Warfarin's anticoagulant effect takes several days to reach steady state due to its mechanism of action on vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.",
      "INR monitoring frequency depends on the stability of the patient's INR values and may range from daily to monthly intervals.",
      "Drug interactions and dietary changes (especially vitamin K intake) can significantly affect INR levels."
