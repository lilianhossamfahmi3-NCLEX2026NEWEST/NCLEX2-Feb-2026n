        "correct": "In clients with COPD, the respiratory drive is stimulated by low oxygen levels (hypoxic drive). Administering excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. An oxygen saturation above the target range (88-92%) indicates that the oxygen flow rate should be reduced.",

        "incorrect": "While mild dyspnea may be expected in COPD, it does not necessarily indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. Increased alertness and improved skin color are positive signs of adequate oxygenation. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min is within the normal range for a client with COPD.",
