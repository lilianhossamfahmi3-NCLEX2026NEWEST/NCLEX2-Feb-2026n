    "correct": "In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is underactive, leading to decreased production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). As a result, the pituitary gland produces more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid. Therefore, an elevated TSH level is a characteristic finding in primary hypothyroidism.  A low Free T4 would also be expected.",
