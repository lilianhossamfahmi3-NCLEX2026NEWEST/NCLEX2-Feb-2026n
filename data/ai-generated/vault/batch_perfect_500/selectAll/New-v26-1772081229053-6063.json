        "correct": "Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 >45 mmHg) indicate significant respiratory compromise and require immediate intervention to prevent respiratory failure. The body's inability to effectively exchange gases leads to cellular hypoxia and potential organ damage. Use of accessory muscles and intercostal retractions demonstrate increased work of breathing and impending respiratory fatigue. Diminished breath sounds can indicate poor air exchange, suggesting severe airway obstruction or respiratory muscle fatigue. Prompt intervention is needed to support ventilation and oxygenation.",

        },
        "incorrect": "While tachycardia and hypertension can be present during an asthma exacerbation due to the stress response and medication side effects (albuterol), they are not as immediately life-threatening as severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and increased work of breathing. Anxiety is common, but addressing the underlying respiratory distress is the priority. Wheezing indicates airway obstruction, but other parameters better represent the severity of the exacerbation. Mild to moderate tachycardia and hypertension are expected compensatory mechanisms.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "Students may associate asthma primarily with wheezing and anxiety, failing to recognize the significance of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and increased work of breathing as signs of impending respiratory failure. The insidious nature of respiratory fatigue can be easily missed if not actively assessed.",
