Hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin deficiency and increased glucose production. Kussmaul respirations are the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis by blowing off carbon dioxide. Fruity-smelling breath is due to the presence of ketones.",

Bradycardia is not associated with DKA; tachycardia is more common due to dehydration and stress. Clear breath sounds are normal; crackles or wheezes would indicate a respiratory issue. Cool, clammy skin is more indicative of hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.",
