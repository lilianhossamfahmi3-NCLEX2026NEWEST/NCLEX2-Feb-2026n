    "correct": "pH of 7.28 indicates severe acidosis, requiring immediate intervention to improve ventilation and acid-base balance. PaCO2 of 58 mmHg signifies hypercapnic respiratory failure, necessitating ventilatory support. PaO2 of 55 mmHg, despite increased FiO2, indicates severe hypoxemia and warrants immediate escalation of respiratory support. Respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute demonstrates significant respiratory distress and fatigue, indicating impending respiratory failure. SpO2 of 87% on 60% FiO2 shows refractory hypoxemia, a hallmark of ARDS, requiring aggressive interventions.",

    "incorrect": "Heart rate of 120 bpm is elevated but expected given the patient's sepsis and respiratory distress; addressing the underlying respiratory failure will likely improve the heart rate. Blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg is within an acceptable range for this patient's condition, and immediate intervention is not required specifically for the BP at this moment. Temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F) indicates fever, which is contributing to the increased metabolic demand, but resolving the respiratory failure is the priority. WBC of 18,000/µL indicates infection and is being treated with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin) as per the MAR, so the priority is the respiratory distress.",
