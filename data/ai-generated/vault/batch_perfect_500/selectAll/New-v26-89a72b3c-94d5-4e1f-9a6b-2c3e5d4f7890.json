Timely antibiotic administration is a cornerstone of sepsis management. Increasing the rate of IV fluids is essential to address the patient's hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. Sepsis often leads to vasodilation and fluid shifts, necessitating aggressive fluid resuscitation. Monitoring urine output is vital to assess the patient's renal function and response to fluid resuscitation. Decreased urine output can indicate inadequate perfusion or kidney injury. Drawing blood cultures helps identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures should be obtained before antibiotic administration whenever possible. Monitoring the patient's lactate level helps assess the severity of sepsis and the effectiveness of treatment. Elevated lactate levels indicate tissue hypoxia.",

Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees may be considered for comfort and to improve respiratory function, but it is not a priority intervention in this scenario.

B: History of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recent course of amoxicillin for suspected sinusitis completed 5 days ago. A: Patient is lethargic and confused. Urine cloudy and foul-smelling. WBC 18,000/mm3. Lactate 3.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures ordered. Currently receiving 0.9% normal saline at 100 mL/hr. Foley catheter inserted at 04:00, draining dark amber urine. Cefepime 2g IVPB prescribed and due at 08:00. Vitals trending downward since admission. P: I'm concerned about worsening sepsis.
