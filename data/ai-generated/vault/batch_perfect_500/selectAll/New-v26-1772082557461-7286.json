    "correct": "Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is essential to assess fetal well-being during labor. Assessing the amniotic fluid for color, odor, and amount helps identify potential complications. Assessing contraction frequency, duration, and intensity provides information about the progress of labor. Establishing IV access allows for medication administration and fluid resuscitation if needed. Assessing maternal pain level allows for appropriate intervention.",

    },
    "incorrect": "Performing a vaginal exam immediately is premature and increases the risk of infection, especially with ruptured membranes. It is important to assess fetal heart tones and maternal status first. Encouraging the patient to ambulate freely is contraindicated until fetal station and presentation are confirmed and stable. Administering pain medication is not the first action, assess the patient's level of pain and explore non-pharmacological interventions first.",

      "whyWrong": "Vaginal exams should be performed judiciously to minimize the risk of infection following rupture of membranes. Initial assessment should focus on fetal well-being and maternal stability.",
