    "incorrect": "Chest physiotherapy is generally not indicated during an acute asthma exacerbation. It may be considered in some cases for mucus plugging, but is not a first-line intervention. Encouraging oral fluids is important for hydration, but is not the priority during an acute exacerbation with respiratory distress. Intramuscular epinephrine is typically reserved for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and is not a first-line treatment for asthma exacerbations.",
