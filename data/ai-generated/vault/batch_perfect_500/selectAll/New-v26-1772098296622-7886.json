        "correct": "Albuterol, a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), provides rapid bronchodilation by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle, addressing the acute bronchospasm. Oxygen supplementation is essential to correct hypoxemia and improve oxygen saturation to acceptable levels. Continuous respiratory monitoring allows for timely assessment of the patient's response to interventions and detection of any deterioration. Ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic, further promotes bronchodilation by blocking muscarinic receptors in the airways.

While hydration is important, oral fluids are not the priority in a child with acute respiratory distress. Intramuscular epinephrine is reserved for anaphylaxis, not first-line asthma treatment.
