Assessing fetal position is already known based on physical exam and is not the most pressing issue. Initiating an epidural is a reasonable pain management option, but not the immediate priority over GBS prophylaxis. Rupture of membranes occurred two hours prior, so checking for cord prolapse is less of a concern now that the fetal heart tracing is reassuring, and is not the immediate next step.",
