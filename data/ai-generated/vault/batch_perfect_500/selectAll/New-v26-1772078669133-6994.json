        "correct": "Hypotension (BP 90/60) in the presence of infection (fever and elevated WBC) and signs of end-organ dysfunction is the MOST indicative finding of sepsis. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Hypotension despite fluid resuscitation is a key indicator. The body's response to infection leads to vasodilation and capillary leak, resulting in decreased blood pressure. This, coupled with the heart's inability to compensate fully, leads to hypotension.",

        "incorrect": "Elevated heart rate, elevated temperature, and elevated white blood cell count are all signs of infection and potential systemic inflammation, but they are not as specific to sepsis as hypotension. While concerning, they do not indicate organ dysfunction without additional findings. Crackles can indicate fluid overload or pneumonia, but are less specific for sepsis without other signs of organ damage. These findings can be present in various conditions, and while they contribute to the overall clinical picture, they do not singularly point to the organ dysfunction characteristic of sepsis.",
