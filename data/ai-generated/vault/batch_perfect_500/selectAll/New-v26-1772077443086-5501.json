    "sbar": "Robert Miller, a 78-year-old male, presented to the emergency department complaining of increasing shortness of breath over the past three days. He states he can no longer lie flat in bed and has to sleep in a recliner. He denies chest pain, fever, or cough. He reports a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both managed with medications. Mr. Miller mentions noticing significant swelling in his ankles and feet. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and a multivitamin. He admits to occasionally missing doses of his lisinopril. On arrival, his vital signs are: BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals crackles in both lung bases. He appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. An IV has been initiated, and oxygen is being administered via nasal cannula at 2L/min. A chest x-ray is pending. The physician has ordered furosemide 40mg IV STAT.",
