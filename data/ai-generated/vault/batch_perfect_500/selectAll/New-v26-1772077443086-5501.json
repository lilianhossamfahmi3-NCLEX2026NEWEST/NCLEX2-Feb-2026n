BACKGROUND: He reports a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both managed with medications. He denies chest pain, fever, or cough. ASSESSMENT: Mr. Miller states he can no longer lie flat in bed (orthopnea) and has to sleep in a recliner. He mentions significant swelling in his ankles and feet (peripheral edema). His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and a multivitamin. He admits to occasionally missing doses of his lisinopril. Vitals: BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals crackles in both lung bases. He appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. RECOMMENDATION: An IV has been initiated, and oxygen is being administered via nasal cannula at 2L/min. A chest x-ray is pending. The physician has ordered furosemide 40mg IV STAT.",
