They should be addressed, but the respiratory distress takes precedence. A white blood cell count of 14,000/mm3 is elevated, suggesting infection, which requires treatment, but is not the immediate priority over respiratory compromise. Productive cough with thick, yellow sputum is expected in COPD exacerbations but does not warrant immediate intervention above the other listed findings.",
