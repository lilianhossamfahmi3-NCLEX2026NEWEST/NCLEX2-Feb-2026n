    "correct": "Significant hypoxemia (SpO2 88% on room air) indicates inadequate oxygenation and requires immediate intervention. Increased respiratory rate (36 breaths/min) and use of accessory muscles indicate respiratory distress and increased work of breathing, requiring immediate intervention.

    "incorrect": "Alert and oriented to person, place, and time indicates that the patient is not experiencing altered mental status due to hypoxia or hypercapnia, although this could change rapidly. While elevated heart rate (128 bpm) is concerning, it's a common compensatory mechanism in asthma exacerbations. The primary concern is the oxygenation and ventilation status. Wheezing is expected during an asthma exacerbation, but its presence alone doesn't necessarily indicate the need for immediate intervention without considering other factors like oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. While speaking in short phrases can indicate some level of respiratory distress, it is not as critical as oxygenation and ventilation status and is often seen in patients having difficulty breathing.",
