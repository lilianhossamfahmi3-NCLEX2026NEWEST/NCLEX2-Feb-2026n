He has a history of Type 1 Diabetes and reports non-adherence to his insulin regimen due to financial constraints. \nB: His blood glucose was 580 mg/dL at 02:00 with large serum ketones. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) results showed: pH 7.25, PaCO2 30 mmHg, and HCO3 16 mEq/L.\nA: The patient is currently lethargic but responsive to verbal stimuli. Kussmaul respirations are present. Continuous insulin infusion at 5 units/hr was started per protocol at 04:00. Normal saline is infusing at 250 mL/hr. His potassium level is 3.1 mEq/L.\nR: We anticipate repeat ABG and electrolyte monitoring. It's important to monitor for signs of cerebral edema. Titrate insulin per protocol to decrease blood glucose by 50-75 mg/dL/hr. Patient education on insulin administration and available financial resources is needed to improve adherence to his treatment plan.",
