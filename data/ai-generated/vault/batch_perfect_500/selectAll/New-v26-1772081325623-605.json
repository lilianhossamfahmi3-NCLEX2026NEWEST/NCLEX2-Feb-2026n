  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The combination of low serum cortisol and elevated ACTH levels is the hallmark of primary adrenal insufficiency.  The adrenal glands are not responding to ACTH stimulation, leading to decreased cortisol production. The low sodium and high potassium are also consistent with mineralocorticoid deficiency.",

      "Na+ and K+": "Low Sodium (Na+), High Potassium (K+) in Addison's"
    },
    "incorrect": "Elevated serum cortisol levels would suggest Cushing's syndrome or a cortisol-secreting tumor, not adrenal insufficiency. Normal cortisol levels would require further investigation to rule out secondary adrenal insufficiency or other causes of the patient's symptoms.  Low ACTH suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency, where the pituitary gland is not producing enough ACTH to stimulate the adrenal glands. The normal sodium and potassium exclude Addison's disease.",

      "reasoning": "The stem is designed to assess the test taker's knowledge of the pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for primary adrenal insufficiency.",
      "potentialDistraction": "The question focuses on laboratory findings, which requires the test taker to understand the hormonal imbalances associated with primary adrenal insufficiency.  Test takers may be distracted by normal or elevated cortisol levels, which are not consistent with the diagnosis."

      "Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is characterized by destruction of the adrenal cortex, leading to deficiencies in cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens.",
      "Key diagnostic findings include low serum cortisol, elevated ACTH, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.",
      "Hyperpigmentation is a characteristic finding in primary adrenal insufficiency due to increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) production, which is a byproduct of increased ACTH secretion.",
      "Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to decreased ACTH secretion. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, hyperpigmentation is typically absent, and electrolyte abnormalities are less pronounced."
