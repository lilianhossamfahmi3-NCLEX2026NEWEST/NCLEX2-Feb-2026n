  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The combination of low serum cortisol and elevated ACTH levels is the hallmark of primary adrenal insufficiency.  The adrenal glands are not responding to ACTH stimulation, leading to decreased cortisol production. The low sodium and high potassium are also consistent with mineralocorticoid deficiency.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated serum cortisol levels would suggest Cushing's syndrome or a cortisol-secreting tumor, not adrenal insufficiency. Normal cortisol levels would require further investigation to rule out secondary adrenal insufficiency or other causes of the patient's symptoms.  Low ACTH suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency, where the pituitary gland is not producing enough ACTH to stimulate the adrenal glands. The normal sodium and potassium exclude Addison's disease.",

      "Hyperpigmentation is a characteristic finding in primary adrenal insufficiency due to increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) production, which is a byproduct of increased ACTH secretion.",
      "Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to decreased ACTH secretion. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, hyperpigmentation is typically absent, and electrolyte abnormalities are less pronounced."
