    "rationale": {
        "correct": "Assessing fetal heart rate (FHR) is the priority. After rupture of membranes, there is a risk of umbilical cord prolapse, which can compromise fetal oxygenation. Immediate assessment of FHR is essential to identify any signs of distress. Continuous FHR monitoring helps to detect early signs of fetal distress, allowing for timely interventions such as repositioning the mother, administering oxygen, or preparing for an emergency delivery.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Obtaining a urine sample can be helpful later to assess for proteinuria or infection, but it is not the immediate priority. Assessing cervical dilation and effacement is important to determine the progress of labor, but not as crucial as ensuring fetal well-being first. Starting an IV is important for medication administration and hydration, but not the most immediate need. Addressing potential fetal compromise takes precedence.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reasoning": "Students may focus on maternal needs such as obtaining a urine sample or starting an IV line. However, the question is asking for the MOST immediate priority, and the risk of cord prolapse makes FHR assessment paramount. Overlooking the potential for fetal compromise can lead to delayed interventions and adverse outcomes.",
