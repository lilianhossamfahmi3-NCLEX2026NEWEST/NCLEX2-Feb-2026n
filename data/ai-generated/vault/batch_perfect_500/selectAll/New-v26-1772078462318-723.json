    "incorrect": "Obtaining a urine sample can be helpful later but is not the immediate priority. Assessing cervical dilation and effacement is important, but not as crucial as ensuring fetal well-being first. Starting an IV is important for medication administration and hydration, but not the most immediate need.",
