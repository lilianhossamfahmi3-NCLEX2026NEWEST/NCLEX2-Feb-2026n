        "incorrect": "While Troponin may be elevated due to underlying CAD or MI, the level (0.04) is mildly elevated and could be due to demand ischemia secondary to heart failure exacerbation. Creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL indicates some degree of renal insufficiency, but is not the most concerning finding in the context of acute respiratory distress.
