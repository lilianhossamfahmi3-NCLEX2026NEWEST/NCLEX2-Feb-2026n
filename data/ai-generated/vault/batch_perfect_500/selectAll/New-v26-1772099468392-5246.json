    "correct": "Effective interventions for a COPD exacerbation focus on improving oxygenation, clearing secretions, and preventing complications. Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2 within the prescribed range (usually 88-92% for COPD patients) is crucial. Assisting with coughing and deep breathing helps mobilize and clear secretions. Monitoring respiratory status frequently allows for early detection of changes and timely intervention. Positioning the client in a high Fowler's position promotes optimal lung expansion. Administering bronchodilators and corticosteroids, as prescribed, helps reduce airway inflammation and bronchospasm.",
    "mnemonic": "O2ABCD: Oxygen, Airway clearance, Bronchodilators, Corticosteroids, Deep breathing",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging fluid restriction is contraindicated in COPD exacerbation as it can thicken secretions, making them harder to clear. While antibiotics may be prescribed if there is evidence of infection, they are not always indicated and should not be selected as a primary intervention without further assessment. Routine chest physiotherapy may not be appropriate for all clients and should be based on individual needs and assessment findings. While monitoring arterial blood gases (ABGs) is important, it is not a direct intervention to improve the client's respiratory status.",
