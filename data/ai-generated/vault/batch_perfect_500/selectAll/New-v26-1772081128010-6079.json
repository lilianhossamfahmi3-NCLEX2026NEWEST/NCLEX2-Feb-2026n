        "correct": "An oxygen saturation of 88% in an infant with bronchiolitis and respiratory distress indicates significant hypoxemia requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and prevent further respiratory compromise. The mottled skin also suggests poor perfusion, which exacerbates the hypoxemia. Addressing hypoxemia is paramount to prevent potential complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Prompt intervention can stabilize the infant's condition and prevent further deterioration.",

A respiratory rate of 64 is elevated but expected with bronchiolitis. While it requires monitoring, the low oxygen saturation is more critical. A temperature of 38.5°C is elevated but not immediately life-threatening. The priority is to address the hypoxemia and respiratory distress.",
