    "correct": "In clients with COPD, the respiratory drive is often stimulated by hypoxemia rather than hypercapnia. Administering excessive oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. A PaCO2 level of 60 mm Hg indicates hypercapnia and the need to reduce the oxygen flow rate.",
    "mnemonic": "High PaCO2, Low O2 flow.",
    "incorrect": "While a SpO2 of 92% is within the acceptable range for COPD patients, it does not necessarily indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. Increased restlessness and anxiety can be signs of hypoxemia, which would warrant increasing oxygen flow, not decreasing it. A respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min is within the normal range for an adult and does not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow.",
    "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking that a SpO2 of 92% is too high, but it is acceptable for COPD patients. The key is to recognize the hypercapnia indicated by the PaCO2 level.",
