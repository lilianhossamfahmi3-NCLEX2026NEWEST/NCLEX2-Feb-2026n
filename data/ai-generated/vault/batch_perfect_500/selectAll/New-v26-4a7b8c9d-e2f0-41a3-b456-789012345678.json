        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees minimizes aspiration. This angle helps prevent gastric contents from refluxing into the airway, a major risk factor for VAP. Regular oral care with chlorhexidine reduces the bacterial load in the oral cavity. Bacteria from the mouth can easily migrate into the lungs, especially in intubated patients. Performing endotracheal suctioning when clinically indicated helps remove secretions that can harbor bacteria. Routine suctioning can be harmful, but suctioning when gurgling sounds are present or when there is a visible buildup of secretions is crucial. Assessing endotracheal tube cuff pressure regularly (every 8 hours) helps ensure proper sealing of the airway. Maintaining adequate cuff pressure (20-30 cm H2O) prevents leakage of secretions around the cuff into the lower respiratory tract. Following strict hand hygiene protocols before and after any contact with the patient or ventilator equipment is essential. This prevents the introduction of pathogens from healthcare providers to the patient.",

        "incorrect": "Administering continuous sedation is not a primary intervention for preventing VAP. While sedation is necessary for patient comfort and ventilator synchrony, it doesn't directly address the bacterial colonization or aspiration risks associated with VAP. In fact, overuse of sedation can increase the risk of VAP by decreasing mucociliary clearance and cough reflex. Increasing the FiO2 to 60% does not prevent VAP and could lead to oxygen toxicity. Adjusting FiO2 should be based on oxygenation needs, not VAP prevention. Maintaining a high FiO2 can cause lung injury. Changing the ventilator circuit daily is no longer a recommended practice. Current guidelines suggest changing the circuit only when visibly soiled or malfunctioning, as frequent changes can increase the risk of introducing pathogens.",

        "sbar": "Situation: Robert Miller is a 68-year-old male admitted 3 days ago with pneumonia complicated by ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation. Background: He has a history of hypertension and COPD. He was initially treated with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, but his condition worsened, leading to intubation. Assessment: Currently, he's on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 cm H2O, rate 16, and tidal volume 450 mL. His last ABG at 1400 revealed pH 7.32, PaCO2 55, PaO2 68, and HCO3 24, indicating respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. His temperature is elevated at 38.6°C. He's receiving vancomycin and cefepime for presumed bacterial infection. He's also on continuous enteral feedings at 60 mL/hr. Oral care has been inconsistent due to staffing constraints. I noted increased secretions in the ET tube and suctioned him twice in the last hour. He's also restless and attempting to pull at his ET tube despite the use of restraints. Recommendation: I recommend we evaluate the need for increased sedation to prevent self-extubation and optimize his ventilator settings to improve gas exchange. We should also prioritize consistent oral care and continue vigilant monitoring for signs of VAP, including changes in sputum characteristics and worsening respiratory status.",
