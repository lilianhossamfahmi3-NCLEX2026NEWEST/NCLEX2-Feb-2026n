            "correct": "Elevated lactate levels are a strong indicator of tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, which are hallmarks of sepsis. A lactate level above 2 mmol/L is considered elevated and, in the context of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, highly suggestive of sepsis. The body's response to infection and inflammation leads to increased glycolysis, overwhelming the mitochondria and resulting in lactate production. This is further exacerbated by hypoperfusion, which limits oxygen delivery to tissues.",

            "incorrect": "Elevated white blood cell count can indicate infection, but is not specific to sepsis. Hyperglycemia is common in sepsis but can also be due to diabetes. Elevated creatinine suggests kidney injury, but is not the most direct indicator of sepsis itself. While WBC elevation is a common sign of infection, it lacks the specificity of lactate in indicating the severity and systemic impact of sepsis. Hyperglycemia in sepsis is often stress-induced and less reliable than lactate. Creatinine elevation indicates kidney dysfunction, which can be a consequence of sepsis but not the primary diagnostic marker.",
