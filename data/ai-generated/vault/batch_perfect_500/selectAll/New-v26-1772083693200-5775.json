    "incorrect": "A heart rate of 180 is elevated but expected in an infant with fever and respiratory distress; however, oxygen saturation is the priority. Increased respiratory rate is also expected in bronchiolitis but the SpO2 indicates the severity. A temperature of 38.9°C (102°F) is elevated, but oxygenation takes priority.",
