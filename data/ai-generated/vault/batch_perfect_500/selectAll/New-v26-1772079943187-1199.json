Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam reveals a slightly enlarged thyroid gland and delayed reflexes. Based on the patient's presentation, which of the following laboratory results would be MOST consistent with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism?",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Elevated TSH and decreased Free T4 are the hallmark laboratory findings in primary hypothyroidism. The elevated TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is attempting to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone, but the thyroid gland is unable to respond adequately, resulting in a low Free T4 level.",
    "incorrect": "Normal TSH and Free T4 would suggest euthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Decreased TSH and elevated Free T4 are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Elevated TSH and normal Free T4 may indicate subclinical hypothyroidism.",
