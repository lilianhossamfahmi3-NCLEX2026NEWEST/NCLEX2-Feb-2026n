    "correct": "The elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, decreased SpO2, and presence of crackles in the lungs indicate possible fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which are life-threatening complications of AKI and require immediate intervention such as notifying the physician and administering diuretics as prescribed.  The elevated potassium level (hyperkalemia) also requires immediate intervention as it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Low urine output further supports the diagnosis of AKI and the need for intervention.",

Poor skin turgor is consistent with dehydration but is being addressed with IV fluids. The elevated blood pressure, while concerning, is not as immediately life-threatening as the respiratory distress, fluid overload, and hyperkalemia. While the patient's lisinopril should be held due to the AKI, this is not the MOST immediate concern.",
