        "correct": "The patient's PaCO2 of 50 mmHg indicates respiratory acidosis and impending respiratory failure. This requires immediate intervention to improve ventilation. Elevated PaCO2 signifies that the patient is not effectively eliminating carbon dioxide, leading to a buildup in the bloodstream and a decrease in pH. This can quickly lead to respiratory arrest if not addressed promptly.",

        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 140 is elevated but expected with an asthma exacerbation as the body attempts to compensate for decreased oxygenation. While it requires monitoring, it's not the most urgent finding. SpO2 of 90% is low but within the ordered parameters of >92% with supplemental oxygen, making the PaCO2 more concerning in this context. Audible wheezing is expected in an asthma exacerbation due to bronchoconstriction and increased mucus production and is not the most critical finding. Temperature of 37.2°C is within normal limits.",
        "questionTrap": {
            "reason": "SpO2 can be maintained with supplemental oxygen even as the patient's ventilation deteriorates, masking the underlying problem of CO2 retention.",
            "commonMistake": "Focusing solely on SpO2 without considering the PaCO2 can lead to overlooking a more critical respiratory compromise. The nurse may be falsely reassured by an acceptable SpO2 reading while the patient's ventilation is failing."

            "Clinical Pearl: Remember that a normal SpO2 does not always indicate adequate ventilation. Always assess the patient's work of breathing and consider obtaining an arterial blood gas (ABG) to evaluate PaCO2 levels."
