O: At 08:00, his vital signs are: Temperature 39.5°C, Heart Rate 120 bpm, Respiratory Rate 32, Blood Pressure 88/50 mmHg, and SpO2 89% on 4L via nasal cannula. He is confused, with a GCS of 12. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. Preliminary lab results show a WBC count of 22,000/mm3 with 15% bands. Lactate is 4.0 mmol/L. A: Septic shock is suspected. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) were started at 07:30 per protocol. He requires increased oxygen support. P: Continue to closely monitor vital signs and await further lab results. Prepare for possible fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration.
