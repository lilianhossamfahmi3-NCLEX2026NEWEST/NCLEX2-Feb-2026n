        "correct": "Elevated troponin levels are the most specific and sensitive indicator of myocardial damage, particularly in the context of AMI.

        "incorrect": "Elevated CK-MB levels can indicate myocardial damage but are less specific than troponin and can be elevated in other conditions, such as skeletal muscle injury. Elevated myoglobin is released early after muscle damage but lacks cardiac specificity, limiting its diagnostic value for AMI. Elevated BNP is indicative of heart failure, not necessarily AMI, and reflects ventricular stretch and volume overload.",

            "reason": "CK-MB can be elevated in non-cardiac conditions, making it a less reliable marker for AMI. Students may choose this option due to its historical significance as a cardiac marker.",
            "description": "Students may confuse CK-MB with troponin, as both are cardiac markers. However, troponin is more specific and sensitive for myocardial damage, making it the preferred marker for diagnosing AMI."

            "Troponin levels typically rise within 3-12 hours after the onset of chest pain, peak at 24-48 hours, and can remain elevated for 5-14 days. Serial measurements are essential.",
            "Serial troponin measurements are crucial for diagnosing AMI, as a single negative troponin does not rule out the diagnosis, especially early in the presentation. Repeat testing is necessary.",
