    "correct": "In clients with COPD, the respiratory drive is stimulated by low oxygen levels (hypoxic drive). Administering excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. An oxygen saturation above the target range (88-92%) indicates that the oxygen flow rate should be reduced to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive.",
    "incorrect": "While a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min is within the normal range, it does not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. A clear chest auscultation is a positive finding and does not suggest the need to reduce oxygen. A heart rate of 80 bpm is within the normal range and does not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow.",
