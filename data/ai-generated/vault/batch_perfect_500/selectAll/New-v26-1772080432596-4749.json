    "correct": "A potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L is concerning in a patient with heart failure, especially in the context of diuretic use (furosemide) and chronic kidney disease. Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and should be addressed promptly. Diuretics can cause both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia depending on the patient's renal function and other medications.",

    "incorrect": "A sodium level of 130 mEq/L is low (hyponatremia), but is less immediately life-threatening than hyperkalemia. It is commonly seen in heart failure due to fluid overload and neurohormonal activation. While BUN and Creatinine are elevated, they are consistent with the patient's chronic kidney disease and are not as immediately concerning as the hyperkalemia in this scenario. An elevated BNP confirms the diagnosis of heart failure exacerbation but does not require immediate intervention.",
