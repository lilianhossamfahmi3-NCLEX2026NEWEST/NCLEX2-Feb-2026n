        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees reduces the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. Performing frequent oral care with chlorhexidine helps to reduce the bacterial load in the oral cavity, minimizing the risk of bacteria entering the lungs. Ensuring proper hand hygiene before and after any patient contact is crucial to prevent the spread of infection. Implementing a sedation vacation daily allows for assessment of the patient's readiness to wean from the ventilator, reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and thus the risk of VAP. Continuous subglottic suctioning removes secretions that accumulate above the endotracheal tube cuff, preventing them from being aspirated into the lungs.",

        },
        "incorrect": "Changing the ventilator circuit every 24 hours is not a recommended practice and can actually increase the risk of VAP by introducing new pathogens. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended as it promotes antibiotic resistance and does not effectively prevent VAP. Instilling normal saline into the endotracheal tube before suctioning is no longer recommended as it can dislodge bacteria and push them deeper into the lungs, increasing the risk of infection. Only changing linens when visibly soiled is not adequate; frequent linen changes help maintain a clean environment and reduce the risk of infection. Limiting suctioning to only when the patient is symptomatic may delay the removal of secretions, potentially leading to airway obstruction and increased risk of pneumonia.",
