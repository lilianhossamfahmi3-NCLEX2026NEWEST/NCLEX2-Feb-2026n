        "correct": "A potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L is critically high and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. It requires immediate intervention to lower the potassium level, such as administering calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, insulin and glucose to shift potassium intracellularly, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body. Dialysis may be necessary if these measures are ineffective. Continuous ECG monitoring is essential to detect and manage any cardiac complications arising from hyperkalemia.",
