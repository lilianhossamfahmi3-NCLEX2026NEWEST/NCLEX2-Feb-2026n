        "correct": "In patients with COPD, the respiratory drive is often stimulated by hypoxemia rather than hypercapnia. Administering excessive oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to decreased respiratory rate and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. An oxygen saturation of 98% is above the target range (88-92% for most COPD patients) and the ABG shows a PaO2 of 95 mmHg and SaO2 of 98%, indicating that the oxygen flow rate should be reduced to avoid suppressing the respiratory drive and causing CO2 retention. The elevated PaCO2 of 60 mmHg further supports this.",
        "incorrect": "While dyspnea, increased heart rate, and restlessness can be signs of respiratory distress, they do not specifically indicate that the oxygen flow rate needs to be reduced in a COPD patient already receiving oxygen. These symptoms could be related to other factors, such as infection or anxiety, and would require further assessment and intervention. In COPD patients, these symptoms are more likely related to the underlying disease process or other complications, not necessarily over-oxygenation. A decreased respiratory rate and increased lethargy are more indicative of CO2 retention due to over-oxygenation in COPD patients.",
