    "correct": "In patients with COPD, the respiratory drive is often stimulated by hypoxemia rather than hypercapnia. Administering excessive oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to decreased respiratory rate and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. An oxygen saturation above the target range (88-92% for most COPD patients) indicates that the oxygen flow rate should be reduced to avoid suppressing the respiratory drive.",
    "incorrect": "While dyspnea, increased heart rate, and restlessness can be signs of respiratory distress, they do not specifically indicate that the oxygen flow rate needs to be reduced. These symptoms could be related to other factors, such as infection or anxiety, and would require further assessment and intervention. A decreased respiratory rate and increased lethargy are more indicative of CO2 retention due to over-oxygenation in COPD patients.",
