    "rationale": {
        "correct": "An elevated Troponin I level, even a slight elevation above the reference range, is highly specific for myocardial damage and is the most concerning finding in the context of suspected AMI. Further investigation and immediate intervention are required. Elevated troponin indicates myocardial cell necrosis, releasing intracellular contents into the bloodstream. The degree of elevation often correlates with the extent of myocardial damage.",

            "cardiacMarkers": "Remember **T**roponin for **T**issue damage in the heart. Think **T**roponin, **T**issue, **T**ime sensitive."

        "incorrect": "While the other lab values are important to note and may require management, they are not as directly indicative of acute myocardial damage as an elevated Troponin I. Potassium within normal limits does not suggest acute myocardial damage. Elevated glucose is common in acute stress but is not specific to AMI. Creatine Kinase (CK) is less specific for myocardial damage than Troponin I.",

            "reason": "The question asks about the MOST concerning finding for AMI, directing the focus to cardiac-specific markers.",
