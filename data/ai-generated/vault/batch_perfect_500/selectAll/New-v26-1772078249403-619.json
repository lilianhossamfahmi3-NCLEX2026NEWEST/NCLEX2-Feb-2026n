NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow. This can precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) in susceptible individuals. Its use should be avoided or significantly limited in patients with CKD.\n\n",

Abrupt cessation, however, could lead to uncontrolled hypertension. Metformin should be reviewed due to the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly if GFR is significantly reduced. Calcium carbonate is generally safe, though phosphorus levels should be considered to prevent hyperphosphatemia.
