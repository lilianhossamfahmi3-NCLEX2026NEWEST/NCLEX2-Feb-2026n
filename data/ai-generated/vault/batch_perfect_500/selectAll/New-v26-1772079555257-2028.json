An elevated heart rate is common in asthma exacerbations due to sympathetic nervous system activation, but it's not as critical as hypoxemia or altered mental status. A productive cough, although uncomfortable, is not the highest priority compared to ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Hyperinflation on chest X-ray is expected in asthma and doesn't require immediate intervention on its own.",
