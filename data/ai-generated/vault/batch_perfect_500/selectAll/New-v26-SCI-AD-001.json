        "correct": "Assessing for bladder distension is crucial. Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia and requires immediate intervention to reduce the stimulus. Catheterizing the patient, if bladder distension is present, is the next essential step. This relieves the pressure and reduces the autonomic response. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and identify trends in the patient's response. Administering ordered PRN antihypertensive medication is vital to control the hypertensive crisis and prevent complications such as stroke. Checking for bowel impaction is important as bowel distension is another common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Addressing this cause can alleviate the symptoms.",

While nasal congestion is present, the SpO2 is 99% indicating adequate oxygenation. Asking the patient about their feelings is important for providing emotional support, but addressing the physiological trigger of autonomic dysreflexia takes precedence. Documenting findings is important but should be done after initiating interventions to address the acute crisis. Lowering the head of the bed is contraindicated. Elevating the head of the bed helps to lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling.",

Bowel program qod, intermittent catheterization q4h.\nA: At 09:15, BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, flushed face, profuse sweating above the injury level, nasal congestion. Patient reports a full bladder and last bowel movement was two days ago. Skin is intact. Denies pain other than headache.\nR: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I have elevated the head of the bed to 90 degrees and loosened his clothing. I recommend checking for bladder distension, catheterizing if necessary, and checking for bowel impaction.
