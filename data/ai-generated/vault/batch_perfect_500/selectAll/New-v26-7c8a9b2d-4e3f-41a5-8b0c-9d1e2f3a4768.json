    "correct": "Initiating strict contact precautions is crucial to prevent the spread of the MDRO to other patients and healthcare workers. This includes wearing gloves and gowns upon entering the patient's room and proper hand hygiene after removal.\nAdministering prescribed vasopressors will help to increase the patient's blood pressure, improving perfusion to vital organs, which is critical in septic shock. The low BP indicated in the SBAR shows this is a high priority intervention.\nMonitoring urine output hourly is essential to assess renal function and the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Low urine output can indicate inadequate perfusion to the kidneys.\nDrawing blood cultures from two different sites helps identify the specific organism causing the infection and guides antibiotic therapy. This is important, especially given the MDRO.\nTitrating oxygen to maintain SpO2 >95% is important. While the patient is currently at 91% on 2L NC, titrating the oxygen to a higher setting will help to improve oxygenation and reduce the risk of tissue hypoxia.",

    "sbar": "SBAR: Situation: Eleanor Vance is a 78-year-old female admitted yesterday with altered mental status and a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Background: She has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). Assessment: Her vital signs include a heart rate of 122, blood pressure of 88/50, respiratory rate of 28, temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), and SpO2 of 91% on 2L NC. She is confused with a GCS of 13. Her lactate is 4.2 mmol/L. Preliminary urine culture results indicate a multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO). Her urine output has been low, approximately 20 mL/hr. Labs show elevated WBC, BUN, Creatinine, Glucose and Lactate. Recommendations: Continue IV fluids and Vancomycin as prescribed. Monitor urine output closely and notify the provider for persistent hypotension. Implement strict contact precautions due to the MDRO. Consider vasopressors if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation. The family is at the bedside, and the patient is a fall risk and full code.",
