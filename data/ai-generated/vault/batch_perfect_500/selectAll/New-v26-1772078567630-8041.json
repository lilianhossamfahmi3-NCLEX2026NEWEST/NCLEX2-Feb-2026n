    "correct": "Hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, along with other signs of infection and organ dysfunction (altered mental status, elevated WBC, elevated lactate), is a key indicator of sepsis.  Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Hypotension refractory to initial fluid bolus suggests significant vasodilation and impaired perfusion, a hallmark of septic shock.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated white blood cell count alone, while indicative of infection, does not definitively diagnose sepsis without evidence of organ dysfunction.
