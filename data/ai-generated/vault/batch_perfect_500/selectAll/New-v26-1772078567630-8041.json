        "correct": "Hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, along with other signs of infection and organ dysfunction (altered mental status, elevated WBC), is a key indicator of sepsis. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Hypotension refractory to initial fluid bolus suggests significant vasodilation and impaired perfusion, a hallmark of septic shock. The body's response to infection leads to systemic inflammation, causing vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.",

        "incorrect": "Elevated white blood cell count alone, while indicative of infection, does not definitively diagnose sepsis without evidence of organ dysfunction. Fever can be present in many conditions, not just sepsis. Clear lung sounds rule out pneumonia as the primary cause of sepsis in this instance. Normal creatinine is not indicative of sepsis. These findings may contribute to the overall clinical picture but are not definitive for sepsis on their own.",
