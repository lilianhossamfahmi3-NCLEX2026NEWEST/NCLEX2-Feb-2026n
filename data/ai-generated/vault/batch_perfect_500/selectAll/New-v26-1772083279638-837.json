  "rationale": {
    "correct": "An elevated troponin level is the most specific and sensitive marker for myocardial damage. While CK and CK-MB can also indicate muscle damage, they are less specific to the heart. A troponin level of 0.1 ng/mL, even though slightly elevated, in the context of acute chest pain and ST-segment elevation is highly suggestive of acute myocardial infarction and requires immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated CK-MB levels can indicate myocardial damage, but it is less specific than troponin. Elevated glucose, normal potassium, and normal sodium, while potentially requiring management, are not the most concerning in the context of acute chest pain and potential MI. They do not directly indicate cardiac muscle damage.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Troponin is the preferred cardiac marker for diagnosing myocardial infarction due to its high specificity and sensitivity.",
