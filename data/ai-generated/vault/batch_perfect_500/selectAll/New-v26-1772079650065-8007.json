    "correct": "INR (International Normalized Ratio) is the most important lab value to monitor in a patient on warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect is monitored by the INR, which reflects the time it takes for blood to clot. Dosage adjustments are made based on INR values to achieve a therapeutic range, typically 2.0-3.0 for atrial fibrillation.",
    "incorrect": "While the other lab values are important for overall patient management, they do not directly reflect the effectiveness or safety of warfarin therapy. \n\n*   Platelet count is important for assessing bleeding risk, but the INR is the primary measure of warfarin's effect.\n*   Potassium level is important for cardiac function, but not directly related to warfarin.\n*   Hemoglobin level is important for oxygen-carrying capacity and can be affected by bleeding, but INR is the primary monitoring parameter for warfarin.\n*   Creatinine level is important for renal function, which can affect drug metabolism, but the INR is the direct measure of warfarin's effect.",
