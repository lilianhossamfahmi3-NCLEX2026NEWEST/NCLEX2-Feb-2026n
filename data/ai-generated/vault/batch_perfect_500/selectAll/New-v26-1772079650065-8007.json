    "correct": "INR (International Normalized Ratio) is the most important lab value to monitor in a patient on warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect is monitored by the INR, which reflects the time it takes for blood to clot. Dosage adjustments are made based on INR values to achieve a therapeutic range, typically 2.0-3.0 for atrial fibrillation.",
