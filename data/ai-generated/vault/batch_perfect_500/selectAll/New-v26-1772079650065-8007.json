        "correct": "The INR (International Normalized Ratio) is the most crucial lab value to monitor in a patient newly started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect is assessed via the INR, which indicates how long it takes for blood to clot. Dosage adjustments are made based on INR values to maintain a therapeutic range, typically 2.0-3.0 for atrial fibrillation, reducing the risk of stroke while minimizing bleeding risk.",
