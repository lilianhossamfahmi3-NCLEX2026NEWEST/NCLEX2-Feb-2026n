  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Elevated TSH and low Free T4, in the context of continued symptoms despite levothyroxine, strongly suggests inadequate thyroid hormone replacement or poor medication absorption. This requires immediate investigation to adjust the levothyroxine dosage or explore alternative causes of hypothyroidism, like medication interference or malabsorption.",
    "incorrect": "While a slightly elevated TSH or low Free T4 alone might warrant adjustment of levothyroxine, the combination is the most concerning as it indicates a significant lack of thyroid hormone replacement despite medication. Normal TSH and Free T4 would suggest other causes for the patient's symptoms. Elevated Free T4 and suppressed TSH would suggest over-replacement, and although potentially concerning, is less indicative of the *worsening* hypothyroid state described in the stem.",

      "Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite levothyroxine require thorough investigation, including lab review, medication adherence assessment, and evaluation for drug interactions or malabsorption.",
