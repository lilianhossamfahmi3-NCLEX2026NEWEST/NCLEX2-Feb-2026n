        "correct": "Elevated TSH and low Free T4, in the context of continued symptoms despite levothyroxine, strongly suggests inadequate thyroid hormone replacement or poor medication absorption.

        "incorrect": "While a slightly elevated TSH or low Free T4 alone might warrant adjustment of levothyroxine, the combination is the most concerning as it indicates a significant lack of thyroid hormone replacement despite medication. Normal TSH and Free T4 would suggest other causes for the patient's symptoms. Elevated Free T4 and suppressed TSH would suggest over-replacement, and although potentially concerning, is less indicative of the *worsening* hypothyroid state described in the stem.",
