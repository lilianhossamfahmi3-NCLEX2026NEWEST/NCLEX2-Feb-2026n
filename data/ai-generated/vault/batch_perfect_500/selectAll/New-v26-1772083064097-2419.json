        "correct": "Elevated troponin I is the most specific and sensitive marker for myocardial damage. While other lab values might be abnormal in the context of acute chest pain, a rising troponin level indicates active myocardial infarction and requires immediate intervention. Troponin levels rise within 3-12 hours of the onset of chest pain, peak at 24-48 hours, and can remain elevated for up to 2 weeks.",

        "incorrect": "Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) and myoglobin are less specific than troponin I and can be elevated in other conditions. While they can be used to assess myocardial injury, they are not the MOST concerning value in this scenario. Normal potassium, sodium, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, while important to monitor, do not directly indicate active myocardial damage. Blood pressure, although lower, is not a laboratory value.",
