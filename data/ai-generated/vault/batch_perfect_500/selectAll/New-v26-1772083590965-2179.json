        "correct": "The patient's low oxygen saturation (90% on room air) coupled with an elevated PaCO2 (50 mmHg) indicates significant respiratory compromise and impending respiratory failure. This requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation, potentially including supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, and possible intubation if respiratory status deteriorates.",
