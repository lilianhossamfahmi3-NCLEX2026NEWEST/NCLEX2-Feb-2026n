A vaginal exam reveals she is 4 cm dilated, 80% effaced, and the fetal head is at -2 station. Which of the following nursing actions is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",

    "correct": "Assessing fetal heart rate (FHR) is the priority nursing action upon admission to labor and delivery, especially after rupture of membranes. This allows for prompt identification of any fetal distress related to cord compression or other complications associated with membrane rupture. The other options are important but are secondary to ensuring fetal well-being.",

    "incorrect": "Auscultating lung sounds is important for baseline assessment but is not the priority after ruptured membranes. Initiating an IV is a standard procedure, but ensuring fetal well-being takes precedence. Administering pain medication should be considered after FHR assessment and as labor progresses, but is not the first action.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "commonMistake": "Students may be tempted to initiate an IV or administer pain medication, as these are common interventions in labor. However, assessing the fetal heart rate is crucial to ensure fetal well-being before any other interventions are implemented, especially after membrane rupture.",
      "whyPeoplePickIt": "Initiating an IV is a common procedure in labor and delivery, leading some students to choose this option. Administering pain medication also seems logical given the patient's report of increasing pain."
