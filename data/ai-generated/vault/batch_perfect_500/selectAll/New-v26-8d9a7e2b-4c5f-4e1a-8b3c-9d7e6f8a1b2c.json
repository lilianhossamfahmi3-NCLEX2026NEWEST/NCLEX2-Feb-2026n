        "correct": "Administer prescribed vasopressors if fluid resuscitation fails to maintain adequate blood pressure.: Vasopressors, such as norepinephrine, are often required in septic shock to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) when fluid resuscitation alone is insufficient. The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid bolus indicates a need for vasopressors. \nImplement contact precautions.: MRSA is highly contagious, and contact precautions are essential to prevent its spread to other patients and healthcare personnel. This includes wearing gloves and gowns upon entering the patient's room and proper hand hygiene. \nMonitor serum creatinine and BUN levels closely.: Elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest kidney injury, which is common in sepsis and can be exacerbated by nephrotoxic antibiotics like vancomycin. Close monitoring is crucial to detect worsening renal function and adjust medication dosages as needed.\nAssess IV site frequently for signs of phlebitis or infiltration.: Vancomycin is a vesicant and can cause irritation and damage to the vein if it infiltrates. Regular assessment helps prevent complications. \nMonitor for signs and symptoms of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE).: While the patient has MRSA, the use of Vancomycin increases the risk of developing VRE. Monitoring for new or worsening infections, especially in the urinary tract or bloodstream, is important.",

Received IV antibiotics (Ceftriaxone) for a presumed UTI five days ago. A: Currently hypotensive (88/52 mmHg), tachycardic (122 bpm), and tachypneic (28 breaths/min). Lactate is elevated at 4.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures drawn STAT, pending results. Urine culture positive for MRSA. Started on Vancomycin at 09:00. R: Continue Vancomycin as prescribed. Monitor vital signs closely, especially blood pressure and heart rate, every 15 minutes. Assess neurological status frequently. Titrate IV fluids (Normal Saline) as prescribed to maintain MAP >65 mmHg. Strict I/O. Contact provider with any significant changes. Repeat lactate level in 2 hours.
