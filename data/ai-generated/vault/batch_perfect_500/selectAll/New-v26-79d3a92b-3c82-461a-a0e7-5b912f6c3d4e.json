BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. Dysphagia screen pending. CT scan revealed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke with early signs of edema. INR is 2.8. \nR: Continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status closely. Administer prescribed labetalol IV for BP control. Hold warfarin per physician order. Prepare for possible tPA administration if within the therapeutic window and no contraindications are present. Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees. Aspiration precautions are essential.
