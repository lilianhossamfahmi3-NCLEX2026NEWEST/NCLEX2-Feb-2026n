Establishing IV access ensures a route for medication administration and fluid resuscitation if needed. Assessing contraction pattern, including frequency, duration, and intensity, is fundamental to monitoring labor progress. Encouraging ambulation, if not contraindicated, can promote labor progress. Offering clear fluids can help maintain hydration and energy levels during early labor.",
