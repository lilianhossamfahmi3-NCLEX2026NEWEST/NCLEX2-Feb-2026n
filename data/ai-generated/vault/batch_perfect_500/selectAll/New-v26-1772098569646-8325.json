Administering oxygen to maintain SpO2, assisting with coughing and deep breathing, and monitoring respiratory status are crucial. Positioning the client to optimize lung expansion is also important. Encouraging fluid intake helps to thin secretions. Pursed-lip breathing helps to prolong exhalation, preventing air trapping.",

Restricting fluids can thicken secretions, making them harder to clear. Routine chest physiotherapy may not be appropriate for all clients and should be based on individual needs.
