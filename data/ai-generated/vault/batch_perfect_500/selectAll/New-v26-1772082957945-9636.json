A significantly decreased GFR indicates severely impaired kidney function and requires immediate intervention. Reduced bicarbonate levels (metabolic acidosis) can also negatively impact cardiac and respiratory function.",
    "incorrect": "While elevated sodium (hypernatremia) contributes to the patient's overall condition and dehydration, it's less immediately life-threatening than hyperkalemia or severe metabolic acidosis. Elevated BUN and Creatinine are expected in AKI and confirm the diagnosis but don't necessarily require *immediate* notification unless coupled with other concerning findings (like significantly decreased GFR). Elevated chloride is often seen in conjunction with hypernatremia and dehydration, but less concerning than potassium. Low urine output is concerning in AKI and requires monitoring, but is an expected finding. The nurse should monitor and notify the provider with urine output trends, but it is not an isolated emergent notification.",
