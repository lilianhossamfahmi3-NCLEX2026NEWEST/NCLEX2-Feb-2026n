        "incorrect": "While altered mental status, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose can be present in sepsis, they are not as specific as the combination of fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate. Elevated creatinine can indicate kidney injury but has many causes. Elevated glucose is common in diabetic patients. Crackles are suggestive of pneumonia which could be the source of the sepsis, but the constellation of other findings needs to be addressed first. These findings alone do not confirm sepsis.",
