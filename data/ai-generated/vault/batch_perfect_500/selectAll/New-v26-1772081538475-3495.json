    "correct": "The patient's hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) in the context of acute myocardial infarction is the most concerning finding. It suggests cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening complication that requires immediate intervention to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The elevated heart rate is likely compensatory for the low blood pressure.",

    "incorrect": "While elevated heart rate, elevated glucose, and slightly elevated Troponin I are all abnormal, they are less immediately life-threatening than hypotension in this clinical context. Elevated heart rate is likely compensatory. Elevated glucose is common in acute stress. The Troponin is only mildly elevated and would be expected to rise further, but doesn't represent the most immediate threat.",

      "reason": "Hypotension can sometimes be overlooked as a normal reaction to pain and anxiety, but in the setting of MI it is a sign of severely compromised cardiac function.",
