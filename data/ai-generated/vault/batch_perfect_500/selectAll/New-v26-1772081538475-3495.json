        "correct": "The patient's hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) in the context of acute myocardial infarction is the most concerning finding. It suggests cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening complication that requires immediate intervention to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The elevated heart rate is likely compensatory for the low blood pressure. Hypotension reduces coronary artery perfusion, exacerbating myocardial ischemia and potentially leading to further cardiac damage. The body attempts to compensate with tachycardia, but this increases myocardial oxygen demand.",

        },
        "incorrect": "While elevated heart rate, elevated glucose, and slightly elevated Troponin I are all abnormal, they are less immediately life-threatening than hypotension in this clinical context. Elevated heart rate is likely compensatory. Elevated glucose is common in acute stress due to the release of cortisol and catecholamines, leading to insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose production. The Troponin is only mildly elevated and would be expected to rise further, but doesn't represent the most immediate threat. A slightly elevated troponin confirms myocardial injury, but doesn't require immediate intervention like hypotension.",

            "reason": "Hypotension can sometimes be overlooked as a normal reaction to pain and anxiety, but in the setting of MI it is a sign of severely compromised cardiac function.",
            "description": "Students may focus on the elevated heart rate or slightly elevated troponin, overlooking the more critical finding of hypotension. The question trap lies in recognizing the immediate threat posed by hypotension in the context of a possible MI."
