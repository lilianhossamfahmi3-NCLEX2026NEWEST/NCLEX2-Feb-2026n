        "correct": "A respiratory rate of 60 and an oxygen saturation of 85% in a 4-year-old child with bronchiolitis indicate severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Immediate intervention is required to improve oxygenation and ventilation, such as increasing oxygen delivery via nasal cannula or face mask, and potentially escalating care to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation if the child's condition does not improve. The normal respiratory rate for a 4-year-old is 20-30 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation is typically above 95%.",

        "incorrect": "While a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F) is elevated, it is not as immediately life-threatening as severe respiratory compromise. Antipyretics can be administered to manage the fever. Capillary refill of 3 seconds is slightly prolonged but not the most critical finding. Normal capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. Nasal flaring is a common sign of respiratory distress in children with bronchiolitis but does not, by itself, warrant immediate intervention over significantly compromised respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. It indicates increased work of breathing but is less critical than hypoxemia.",
