    "correct": "In clients with COPD, the respiratory drive is stimulated by low oxygen levels (hypoxic drive). Administering excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. An oxygen saturation above the target range (88-92%) indicates that the oxygen flow rate should be reduced to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive.",
    "mnemonic": "High O2 in COPD can halt the hypoxic drive.",
    "incorrect": "While a heart rate of 90 bpm is within normal limits, it doesn't directly indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min is within normal limits and does not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. Clear breath sounds bilaterally are a positive finding and do not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow.",
