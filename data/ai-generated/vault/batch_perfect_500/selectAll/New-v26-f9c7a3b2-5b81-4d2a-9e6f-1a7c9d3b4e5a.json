    "correct": "Initiating prone positioning can improve oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, reducing alveolar collapse. Implementing low tidal volume ventilation (e.g., 6 mL/kg) can minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) by preventing overdistension of alveoli. Maintaining positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) helps to keep alveoli open, improving gas exchange and preventing alveolar collapse. Monitoring arterial blood gases (ABGs) frequently is crucial for assessing the client's respiratory status and guiding ventilator adjustments. Administering neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may be necessary to reduce oxygen consumption and improve ventilator synchrony, especially if the client is fighting the ventilator, but only after sedation and analgesia.",

    "incorrect": "Increasing the tidal volume beyond recommended limits can cause VILI and worsen lung injury. Decreasing PEEP too rapidly can lead to alveolar collapse and decreased oxygenation. Infrequent monitoring of ABGs can delay necessary ventilator adjustments, potentially leading to worsening respiratory failure. Delaying or avoiding neuromuscular blockade when indicated can increase oxygen consumption and worsen ventilator synchrony, especially in severe cases of ARDS. Although diuresis is important, avoiding fluid overload is more important than strict fluid restriction.",

He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation at 0400 due to worsening respiratory status. \nA: Currently on assist-control ventilation, FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O. Chest X-ray shows bilateral diffuse infiltrates. He's restless and requires frequent suctioning. \nR: I'm concerned about his worsening oxygenation and increased work of breathing. I recommend considering prone positioning and further evaluation of ventilator settings. Please assess immediately.",
