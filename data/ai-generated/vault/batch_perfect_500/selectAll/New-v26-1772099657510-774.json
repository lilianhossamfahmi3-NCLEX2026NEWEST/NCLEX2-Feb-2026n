    "correct": "A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. This requires immediate intervention such as administering medications to shift potassium intracellularly or eliminate it from the body. A urine output of 20 mL/hr is concerning and requires intervention. A change in mental status requires intervention.",

    "incorrect": "A creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL is elevated but expected in AKI. While it needs monitoring, it doesn't require immediate intervention compared to hyperkalemia.
