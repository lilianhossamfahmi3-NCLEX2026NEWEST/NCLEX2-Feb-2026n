    "correct": "In patients with COPD, the respiratory drive is often stimulated by hypoxia rather than hypercapnia. Administering excessive oxygen can suppress the hypoxic drive, leading to decreased respiratory effort and increased PaCO2 levels, resulting in respiratory acidosis. A PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg is elevated, indicating respiratory acidosis and the need to reduce the oxygen flow rate.",
    "incorrect": "While a heart rate of 90 bpm is within normal limits, it does not indicate the need to reduce oxygen flow. An oxygen saturation of 94% is within the target range for COPD patients, so reducing oxygen is not indicated. Clear breath sounds bilaterally are a positive finding and do not suggest the need to reduce oxygen flow.",
