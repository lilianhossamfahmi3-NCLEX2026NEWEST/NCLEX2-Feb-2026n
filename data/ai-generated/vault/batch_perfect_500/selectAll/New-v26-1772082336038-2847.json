These findings warrant immediate intervention such as increased oxygen delivery (e.g., non-rebreather mask or BiPAP) and potentially intubation if the patient's condition deteriorates despite initial interventions.",

    "incorrect": "While accessory muscle use and pursed-lip breathing are signs of respiratory distress, they are expected findings in a COPD exacerbation and do not represent the *most* urgent need for intervention compared to inadequate oxygenation and respiratory acidosis.\nA heart rate of 110 is elevated but common in COPD exacerbations due to stress and medication side effects. It is not the most critical finding requiring *immediate* action.\nProductive cough with yellow sputum is indicative of infection and warrants treatment with antibiotics, but the more immediate threat is the patient's compromised respiratory status.",
