  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Significantly decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 88% on room air), elevated PaCO2 (50), and use of accessory muscles indicate severe respiratory distress and impending respiratory failure.  These findings necessitate immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation.",
    "incorrect": "While an elevated heart rate (120) and respiratory rate (32) are concerning and expected in an asthma exacerbation, they are not the most immediate indicators of respiratory failure. Hyperinflation on CXR is expected with asthma, but doesn't require immediate intervention beyond treating the acute exacerbation. Speaking in short sentences is a symptom of shortness of breath, but the low SpO2 and elevated PaCO2 are more critical.",

      "Always prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) in respiratory distress.",
