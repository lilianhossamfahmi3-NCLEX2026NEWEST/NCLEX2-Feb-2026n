    "correct": "The combination of hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg) and elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) are strong indicators of septic shock, a severe form of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction.",

    "incorrect": "While altered mental status and fever are common in sepsis, they are not specific enough to be the MOST indicative finding in this scenario. Other conditions can cause these symptoms. Tachycardia and tachypnea are also common in sepsis, but are less specific than hypotension and elevated lactate.",

      "reason": "The question asks for the MOST indicative finding, requiring prioritization of assessment data.",

      "Key elements in the diagnosis of sepsis include identifying the source of infection, SIRS criteria, and evidence of organ dysfunction.",
