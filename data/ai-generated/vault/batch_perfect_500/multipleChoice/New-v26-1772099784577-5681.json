He has no known allergies. His mother reports he has had a cold for the past few days, which has worsened today.\n08:02 Assessment: Respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min, heart rate is 120 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally. He is alert but appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe.\n08:03 Recommendation: Immediate intervention is needed to improve oxygenation and reduce airway obstruction. Administer oxygen via nasal cannula and prepare to administer albuterol via nebulizer. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential. Consider chest X-ray to rule out other causes.",

        "correct": "Administering oxygen via nasal cannula is the most appropriate initial intervention because the child's oxygen saturation is below the normal range. Providing supplemental oxygen addresses the immediate need for oxygenation and helps to prevent hypoxia. This intervention supports alveolar oxygen delivery, improving tissue perfusion and reducing the risk of complications associated with hypoxemia. The goal is to raise the SpO2 to at least 94%.",
        "incorrect": "While albuterol is an important medication for asthma exacerbations, it is not the initial priority when the patient is hypoxemic. Oxygen should be administered first, followed by bronchodilators like albuterol. Monitoring vital signs is essential, but it does not address the immediate need for oxygenation. Continuous monitoring should be implemented after initial interventions. Calling the healthcare provider is important for updating the patient's status and receiving further orders, but it should not delay immediate interventions to address hypoxemia.",
