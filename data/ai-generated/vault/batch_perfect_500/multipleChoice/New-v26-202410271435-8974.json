Auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. His skin is cool, pale, and diaphoretic. Capillary refill is sluggish at 4 seconds. Current vital signs: Blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, Heart rate 110 bpm, weak and thready, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, Temperature 36.1°C (97°F), Blood glucose 45 mg/dL measured via glucometer.",
