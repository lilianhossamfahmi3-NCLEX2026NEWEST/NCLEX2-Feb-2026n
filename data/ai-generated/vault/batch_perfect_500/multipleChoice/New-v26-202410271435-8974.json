    "correct": "The patient's blood glucose of 45 mg/dL and unresponsiveness indicate severe hypoglycemia. Intravenous D50W is the most rapid and effective way to increase blood glucose levels in an unresponsive patient.

    "incorrect": "Administering normal saline is appropriate for fluid resuscitation, but it does not address the immediate threat of hypoglycemia. While the patient may need fluids, the priority is to raise the blood glucose. Subcutaneous glucagon can be used to treat hypoglycemia, but it is less reliable than intravenous dextrose in an unresponsive patient. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose, but this process is slower and may be ineffective if the patient has depleted glycogen stores or is taking beta-blockers. Obtaining an ECG is important to assess for cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not the priority in this situation. Severe hypoglycemia can cause cardiac abnormalities, but addressing the hypoglycemia is the immediate priority.",

Auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. His skin is cool, pale, and diaphoretic. Capillary refill is sluggish at 4 seconds. Current vital signs: Blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, Heart rate 110 bpm, weak and thready, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, Temperature 36.1°C (97°F), Blood glucose 45 mg/dL measured via glucometer.",
