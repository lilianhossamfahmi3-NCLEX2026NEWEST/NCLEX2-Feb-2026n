    "correct": "Placing the infant in the knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which reduces the right-to-left shunting of blood in the heart. This improves pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation, directly addressing the physiological cause of the hypercyanotic spell. The ABG shows respiratory acidosis, and the vitals highlight severe hypoxemia, so this is the priority. This action stabilizes the patient quickly, allowing other interventions to be more effective.",

    "incorrect": "Administering oxygen via face mask, while important, is secondary to addressing the shunt. Oxygen alone may not be sufficient to overcome the intracardiac shunting. The patient is in a tet spell. Morphine administration is appropriate to decrease agitation and promote vasodilation. However, addressing the physiological shunt is the priority. Assessing lung sounds is important for overall assessment, but in the context of a tet spell, the priority is to improve oxygenation by decreasing right-to-left shunting through the knee-chest position.",

Mother reports increased irritability and cyanosis episodes over the past 24 hours. Last episode occurred at home prior to arrival. ASSESSMENT: At 14:30, HR 180, RR 60, SpO2 78% on room air, agitated. Skin mottled with circumoral cyanosis. IV access established in the left forearm. Currently crying. No fever present. Last dose of morphine given at 04:00. ASSESSMENT (cont.): Cardiac monitor shows sinus tachycardia. Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Weight 7 kg. ASSESSMENT (cont.): Labs pending (CBC, electrolytes, ABG). RECOMMENDATION: Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 >85%. Administer morphine as needed for pain/agitation. Prepare for potential escalation of care if condition deteriorates. Consider knee-chest positioning.",
