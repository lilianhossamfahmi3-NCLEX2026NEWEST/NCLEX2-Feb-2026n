  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. The classic signs include sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding (though it can be concealed), a rigid, board-like abdomen, and fetal distress (indicated by heart rate decelerations). The elevated blood pressure could be related to pain and the underlying condition.",
    "incorrect": "Placenta previa presents with painless vaginal bleeding, not abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy usually occurs earlier in gestation and presents with unilateral abdominal pain, not generalized abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 34 weeks. Preterm labor would present with regular contractions and cervical changes, which are not described in the scenario. While preeclampsia is possible, the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and rigid abdomen point more strongly to abruptio placentae.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Abruptio placentae is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.",
      "Concealed hemorrhage is possible in abruptio placentae, making assessment challenging.",
      "Risk factors for abruptio placentae include hypertension, trauma, and cocaine use.",
      "A board-like abdomen is a key sign of abruptio placentae."
    ],
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "Students may be tempted to select preeclampsia due to the elevated blood pressure; however, the question emphasizes the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and a rigid abdomen.",
      "reasoning": "Preeclampsia can cause abdominal pain, but it is usually epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, not the severe, generalized abdominal pain associated with abruptio placentae. Also, the rigid abdomen is a more specific indicator of abruptio placentae."
