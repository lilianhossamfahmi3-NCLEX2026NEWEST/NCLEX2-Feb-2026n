On admission, her vital signs are: Temperature 37.8°C (100.0°F), Heart Rate 92 bpm, Respiratory Rate 20 breaths/min, Blood Pressure 130/80 mmHg. A vaginal examination reveals the cervix is 4 cm dilated, 80% effaced, and the fetal head is at -2 station. The fetal heart rate tracing shows a baseline of 140 bpm with moderate variability and occasional accelerations. Which of the following nursing interventions is the MOST appropriate at this time?",

    "correct": "Monitoring the fetal heart rate pattern closely is crucial to assess fetal well-being after rupture of membranes, as it helps detect any potential complications like umbilical cord compression or fetal distress. While the other options may be implemented later, continuous fetal monitoring is the priority.",
    "incorrect": "Initiating an oxytocin infusion to augment labor is premature at this stage, as the patient is only 4 cm dilated and contractions are still mild. Administering pain medication might be considered later, but the initial focus should be on fetal assessment. Preparing for immediate delivery is not indicated at this stage, as the patient is not fully dilated and there are no signs of immediate fetal distress.",
