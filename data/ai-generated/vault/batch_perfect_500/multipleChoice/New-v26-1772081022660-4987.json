On admission, her vital signs are: Temperature 37.8°C (100.0°F), Heart Rate 92 bpm, Respiratory Rate 20 breaths/min, Blood Pressure 130/80 mmHg. A vaginal examination reveals the cervix is 4 cm dilated, 80% effaced, and the fetal head is at -2 station. The fetal heart rate tracing shows a baseline of 140 bpm with moderate variability and occasional accelerations. Which of the following nursing interventions is the MOST appropriate at this time?",
