        "correct": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, preventing clot formation. The INR (International Normalized Ratio) is the MOST important lab value to monitor because it reflects the extent of anticoagulation. The therapeutic INR range for patients on warfarin is typically 2.0-3.0, but may be higher in some cases, such as those with mechanical heart valves. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial to maintain the INR within the target range and prevent both bleeding and thromboembolic complications.",

        "incorrect": "PTT is used to monitor heparin therapy, not warfarin. Platelet count is important for assessing bleeding risk but is not directly affected by warfarin. Hemoglobin is important for assessing anemia but is not directly related to warfarin therapy.",
