    "correct": "The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2) and hypoxemia (low PaO2). While increasing oxygen is important, it must be done cautiously in COPD patients to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. The best initial intervention is BiPAP to assist ventilation and improve gas exchange without risking oxygen-induced hypercapnia.  BiPAP provides positive pressure that helps to reduce the work of breathing, open up airways, and improve oxygenation and ventilation.",

    "incorrect": "Increasing the oxygen flow rate significantly could lead to CO2 retention and respiratory depression in a patient with COPD who relies on hypoxemia to stimulate breathing. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is a more invasive intervention that should be considered if non-invasive methods fail, or if the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly. Ordering a repeat ABG is necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment, but it's not the most appropriate initial intervention. Chest physiotherapy may be helpful for mobilizing secretions, but it doesn't address the immediate need for improved ventilation and oxygenation.",
