O: At 07:00, the patient reported increased pain and swelling in his left leg. His vital signs are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 20 breaths/min, Temp 37.2°C, SpO2 94% on room air. He is alert and oriented. A: The DVT appears to be worsening despite initial subcutaneous heparin anticoagulation therapy. A new order was received for a continuous heparin infusion at 1600 units/hour. Current aPTT is 38 seconds. R: Please verify the new order for the continuous heparin infusion and initiate it. Monitor aPTT every 6 hours and adjust the heparin infusion rate according to the established hospital protocol. Assess pain and swelling in his left leg every 4 hours. Notify the physician for aPTT values greater than 90 seconds or any signs of bleeding. The next dose of warfarin is scheduled for 20:00.",
