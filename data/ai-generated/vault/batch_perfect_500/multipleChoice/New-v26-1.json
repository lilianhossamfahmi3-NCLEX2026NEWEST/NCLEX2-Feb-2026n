        "sbar": "SITUATION: I'm calling about [Child's Name], a 6-year-old with a history of asthma, who presented to the emergency department with increased work of breathing, audible wheezing, and a nonproductive cough. The parents report symptoms began gradually over two days and worsened significantly this morning. BACKGROUND: The child has a known history of asthma, managed with a rescue inhaler at home. They have had previous asthma exacerbations requiring emergency department visits. The child is up-to-date on vaccinations and has no known allergies. The parents state they administered the rescue inhaler twice prior to arrival with minimal improvement. ASSESSMENT: Vital signs are: heart rate 140 bpm, respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, and temperature 37.2°C (99°F). I observe increased work of breathing, including nasal flaring and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally. The child is alert but appears anxious. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend administering oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 94% and initiating nebulized albuterol treatments every 20 minutes for the first hour. I also recommend monitoring respiratory status closely, including continuous pulse oximetry and frequent auscultation of lung sounds. Please advise if you would like any further interventions, such as chest X-ray or administration of corticosteroids at this time."
