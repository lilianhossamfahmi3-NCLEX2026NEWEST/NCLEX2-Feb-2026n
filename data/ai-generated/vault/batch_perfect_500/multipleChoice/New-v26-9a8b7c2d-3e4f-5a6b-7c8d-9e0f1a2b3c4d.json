The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 140 indicates severe ARDS, and their respiratory status is deteriorating despite current oxygen therapy.

Furosemide could further decrease blood volume and worsen hypotension. Increasing the FiO2 alone without addressing the underlying alveolar collapse will likely not be sufficient to improve oxygenation and can lead to oxygen toxicity. Continuing current antibiotic therapy addresses the infection, but it doesn't provide immediate respiratory support needed to improve oxygenation in ARDS. Requesting a chest X-ray can provide further diagnostic information, but it will delay crucial interventions aimed at improving oxygenation and ventilation. The patient requires immediate intervention to support respiratory function.",

A: Patient diagnosed with ARDS. ABG from 0715 reveals: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 64, HCO3 25. Patient is restless and using accessory muscles. B: Increased work of breathing, decreased oxygen saturation despite current oxygen therapy. Crackles auscultated bilaterally. R: Requesting orders for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation with consideration for proning. Consider also administering a neuromuscular blockade to reduce oxygen consumption. The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone and azithromycin, administered at 0600. 0730: Patient's BP is trending downwards, and urine output has decreased to 15 mL/hr for the past two hours.",
