  "rationale": {
    "correct": "A blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg in the context of fever, tachycardia, elevated WBC count, and altered mental status strongly suggests sepsis with hypotension.  Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Hypotension, indicated by a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, is a key indicator of septic shock. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes.",
    "mnemonic": {
      "SEPSIS": "Signs & Symptoms: Slurred speech or confusion, Extreme shivering or muscle pain, Passing no urine (anuria), Severe breathlessness, It feels like you're going to die, Skin mottled or discolored"
    },
    "incorrect": "While an elevated white blood cell count, elevated temperature, and positive urine culture can all be indicators of infection and potential sepsis, they are not as immediately concerning as hypotension. Hypotension suggests a more advanced stage of sepsis and requires immediate intervention to prevent organ damage and death.",
    "questionTrap": {
      "elevatedWbc": "Elevated WBC is expected with infection, but hypotension is a more critical finding.",
      "elevatedTemp": "Elevated temperature can indicate infection, but in the context of the other symptoms, hypotension is the most concerning.",
      "positiveUrineCulture": "A positive urine culture confirms the UTI, but the blood pressure indicates a systemic response and likely sepsis."
