    "correct": "Administering a beta-blocker is crucial to rapidly control the cardiovascular symptoms of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia and arrhythmias, which can lead to life-threatening complications. While other interventions are also important, addressing the cardiac manifestations is paramount in the acute phase.",

      "meaning": "Cooling measures, Beta-blockers, Block hormone synthesis (PTU/Methimazole), Block hormone release (iodine)"

    "incorrect": "Administering propylthiouracil (PTU) is important but not the immediate priority. PTU blocks the synthesis of thyroid hormone, but its effects are not immediate.  Cooling measures are important, but cardiovascular stabilization takes precedence.  Administering lorazepam may help with anxiety and agitation, but does not directly address the primary physiological threat of cardiovascular instability.",

      "whyTrapped": "The question asks for the 'MOST important' and 'FIRST' intervention.  Blocking hormone synthesis is vital, but slower acting than a beta blocker.",
