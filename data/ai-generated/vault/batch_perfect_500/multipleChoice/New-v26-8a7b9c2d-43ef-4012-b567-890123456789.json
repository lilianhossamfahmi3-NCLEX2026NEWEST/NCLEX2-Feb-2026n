R: Mr. Alvarez developed a cough and fever three days prior to admission. His medical history includes COPD and hypertension, both managed with medications at home. A: At 07:00, the patient is lethargic with a blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg, heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 90% on 2L nasal cannula. His temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C). Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr over the last two hours. WBC count is 18,000/µL. Lactate is 4.0 mmol/L. Creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL. Blood cultures are pending. Procalcitonin is 3.5 ng/mL. He is currently receiving IV fluids at 100 mL/hr. At 07:15, Vancomycin 1 gram IVPB was administered per order. E: Prepare for potential transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Continue close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and respiratory status. Await blood culture results and further orders from the physician. Consider escalating respiratory support if oxygen saturation continues to decline.",
