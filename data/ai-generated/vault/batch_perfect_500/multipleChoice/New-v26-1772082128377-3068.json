    "correct": "The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2, normal HCO3) and hypoxemia. Increasing the FiO2 via a non-rebreather mask is the most appropriate immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and address the acidosis by increasing PaO2 and potentially decreasing PaCO2.
