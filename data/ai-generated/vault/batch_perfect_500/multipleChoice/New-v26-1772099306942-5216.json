    "correct": "Administering a bronchodilator medication, such as albuterol, is the priority intervention to open the airways and improve breathing. The patient is experiencing an asthma exacerbation, and bronchodilators are the first-line treatment to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow.",
    "mnemonic": "ABC - Airway, Breathing, Circulation. In this case, addressing the airway (bronchodilation) is the priority.",
    "incorrect": "While oxygen administration is important, it is not the priority over opening the airways with a bronchodilator. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, but addressing the bronchospasm will improve oxygenation. Monitoring vital signs is important, but it should not delay the administration of a bronchodilator. Obtaining a detailed history is important, but it should not delay immediate interventions to improve breathing.",
    "questionTrap": "The question trap is to focus solely on the low oxygen saturation and prioritize oxygen administration over bronchodilator administration. While oxygen is important, addressing the underlying bronchospasm is the priority.",

      "Oxygen saturation should be monitored closely during an asthma exacerbation.",
