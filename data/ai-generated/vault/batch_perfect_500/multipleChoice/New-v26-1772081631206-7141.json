    "incorrect": "While a temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) is indicative of fever, it is not specific to sepsis and can be present in other infections.  A white blood cell count of 15,000/μL is elevated, suggesting infection, but is not as specific for sepsis as an elevated lactate. A creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL indicates renal impairment, which can be associated with sepsis but is not the most indicative finding. Altered mental status can be caused by many conditions, including infection, but is not the most specific indicator of sepsis in this scenario.",
