        "correct": "The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia and elevated PaCO2 consistent with COPD exacerbation. Increasing oxygen supplementation is crucial to improve oxygenation and address the hypoxemia. However, it is vital to carefully monitor the patient's respiratory drive, as excessive oxygen administration can suppress the hypoxic drive in COPD patients, leading to further CO2 retention and worsening acidosis. Titration of oxygen is important.",
