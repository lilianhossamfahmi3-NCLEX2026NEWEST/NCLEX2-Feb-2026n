Addressing the underlying cause of the decelerations (likely decreased uterine perfusion) takes priority. \n\nIncreasing the IV fluid rate may be helpful if hypovolemia is suspected, but it is not the FIRST action. Repositioning is a simpler and faster intervention that should be attempted first. \n\nPreparing for an emergency cesarean section is premature. Late decelerations warrant intervention, but not necessarily immediate surgical delivery. Other interventions should be attempted first.",
