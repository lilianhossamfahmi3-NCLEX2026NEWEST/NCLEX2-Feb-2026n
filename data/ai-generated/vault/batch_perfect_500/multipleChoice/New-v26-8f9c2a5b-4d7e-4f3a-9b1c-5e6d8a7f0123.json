The roommate reported that the patient stated, 'I can't take it anymore,' before the incident. A: The patient is currently somnolent but arousable to verbal stimuli. His vital signs are stable: HR 92, BP 118/76, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. The Acetaminophen toxicity protocol has been initiated. A psychiatry consult was requested at 03:15. The attending physician is aware of the patient's condition. B: Continue to closely monitor vital signs, implement suicide precautions immediately, administer all prescribed medications as ordered, and maintain a safe and secure environment for the patient. A comprehensive mental status assessment is pending the psychiatry evaluation. Closely monitor for any signs or symptoms of liver failure, given the acetaminophen overdose.",
