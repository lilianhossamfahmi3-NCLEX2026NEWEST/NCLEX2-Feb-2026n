She reports non-compliance with her sodium-restricted diet over the past week.\n* Assessment: Patient is exhibiting signs of acute decompensated heart failure. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally in the lungs. She is anxious and restless.\n* Recommendation: I recommend immediate initiation of intravenous diuretics and continuous cardiac monitoring.",
