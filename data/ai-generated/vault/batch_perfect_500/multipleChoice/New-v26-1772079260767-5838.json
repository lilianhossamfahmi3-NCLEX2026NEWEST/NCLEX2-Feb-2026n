    "correct": "The elevated potassium level (6.2 mEq/L) poses an immediate threat to the patient's cardiac function. Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Immediate intervention is required to lower the potassium level.",

    "incorrect": "While elevated BUN and creatinine indicate kidney dysfunction, they do not pose an immediate threat to life like hyperkalemia.
