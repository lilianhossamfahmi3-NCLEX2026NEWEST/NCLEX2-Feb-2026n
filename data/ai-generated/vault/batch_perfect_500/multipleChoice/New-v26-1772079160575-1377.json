Further evaluation is needed before treating it as a migraine.\nAdministering oxygen is not the priority unless the patient's oxygen saturation is low. While the patient is tachypneic, their SpO2 is 98%, making oxygen administration unnecessary at this point.\nApplying a cold compress to the forehead might provide some comfort, but it does not address the potential underlying cause of the headache. It's important to first rule out more serious conditions before focusing on symptomatic relief.",
