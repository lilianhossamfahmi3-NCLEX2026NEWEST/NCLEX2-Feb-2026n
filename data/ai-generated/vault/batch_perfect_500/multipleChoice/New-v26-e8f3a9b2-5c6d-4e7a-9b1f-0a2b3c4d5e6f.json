        "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, is admitted for pneumonia and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to declining respiratory status. Background: He was admitted three days ago, initially responsive to antibiotics. Assessment: At 07:00, the patient was noted to be restless, with frequent ventilator alarms. By 07:15, his SpO2 is fluctuating between 88-91% despite an FiO2 of 50%. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 cm H2O to 38 cm H2O within the last hour. Auscultation reveals coarse rhonchi bilaterally. An arterial blood gas (ABG) from 06:00 shows a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, PaO2 of 65 mmHg, and HCO3 of 26 mEq/L. Recommendation: I recommend immediate assessment and intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Please evaluate for possible causes of the increased PIP, such as secretions or bronchospasm, and consider suctioning the patient's endotracheal tube.",
