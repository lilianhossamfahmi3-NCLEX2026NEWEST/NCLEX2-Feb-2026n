    "correct": "Place the infant in the knee-chest position: This increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt and increasing pulmonary blood flow. Administer oxygen via face mask: Supplemental oxygen can help increase the PaO2 and improve oxygen saturation. Administer morphine sulfate IV as prescribed: Morphine can help decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance, breaking the cycle of the hypercyanotic spell. Provide calm and comforting measures: Reducing anxiety and crying can decrease oxygen demand and minimize the severity of the spell. Prepare for potential administration of phenylephrine: This medication can increase systemic vascular resistance, which can help reduce the right-to-left shunt.",

It addresses hypovolemia, which isn't indicated in the scenario. Perform chest physiotherapy: This intervention is not indicated during a hypercyanotic spell and could worsen the infant's distress and oxygenation.",

At 13:15, his SpO2 suddenly dropped from 88% to 72%, accompanied by increased respiratory effort and irritability. He has a history of 'tet spells' managed with knee-chest positioning and oxygen. ASSESSMENT: At 13:20, his vital signs are: HR 190 bpm, RR 60, SpO2 72%, BP 90/60 mmHg. He is dusky and irritable. Labs from 08:00 show Hgb 16 g/dL, Hct 48%. Current medications: Propranolol 0.5 mg PO q6h. RECOMMENDATION: Please evaluate and provide immediate interventions to improve oxygenation and reduce the hypercyanotic spell. Consider morphine administration and further diagnostic evaluation if the episode does not resolve promptly. Prepare for possible escalation of care.",
