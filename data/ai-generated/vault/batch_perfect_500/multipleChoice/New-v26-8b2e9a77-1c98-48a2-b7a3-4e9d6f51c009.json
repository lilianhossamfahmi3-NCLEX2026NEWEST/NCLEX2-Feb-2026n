        "correct": "Administering hypertonic saline is the priority intervention. The patient's rapidly declining GCS, fixed and dilated pupil, bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and potential herniation. Hypertonic saline (e.g., 3% NaCl) is used to draw fluid out of the brain tissue, reducing cerebral edema and ICP. While other interventions are important, addressing the elevated ICP is paramount to prevent further neurological damage and potential death. This directly combats the life-threatening increase in ICP demonstrated by the patient's symptoms and vital signs.",

        "incorrect": "A. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees is a standard nursing intervention for patients with increased ICP, but it's not the priority. While helpful, it is not as rapidly effective as hypertonic saline in reducing cerebral edema. B. Notifying the provider is essential, but it doesn't directly address the immediate threat of increased ICP. The provider has already been notified per the SBAR recommendation for a STAT neuro consult, and the nurse needs to act quickly. C. Increasing the oxygen flow rate might be considered if the patient's oxygen saturation continues to decline despite the 2L NC, but the primary problem is increased ICP, not hypoxemia. Addressing ICP will improve cerebral perfusion and indirectly improve oxygenation.",

Background: He has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (managed with warfarin), and hyperlipidemia. He initially presented with left-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. Assessment: The 0700 report indicated a stable condition. However, at 0900, the patient exhibits increased lethargy, a fixed and dilated right pupil, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 (E2, V2, M4). His blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm, respiratory rate is 10 and irregular, and SpO2 is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. His temperature is 37.2°C. Current medications include warfarin, metoprolol, aspirin, and docusate. Recent INR was 2.5, within the therapeutic range. Recommendation: STAT neuro consult is already in progress. Given the rapid neurological decline, consider immediate interventions for increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including possible intubation and administration of hypertonic saline. Continuous monitoring of neurological status and vital signs is crucial. Be prepared for potential further deterioration and the need for advanced airway management.",
