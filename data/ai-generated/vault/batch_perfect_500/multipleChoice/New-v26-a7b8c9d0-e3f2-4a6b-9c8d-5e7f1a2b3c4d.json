B: He has a history of COPD and hypertension. He has been receiving Ceftriaxone for pneumonia and oxygen therapy. R: At 0600, he exhibited increasing respiratory distress with SpO2 at 88% on 6L nasal cannula. He showed increased work of breathing, utilizing accessory muscles, and coarse crackles were auscultated bilaterally with a productive cough of thick, yellow sputum. At 0615, he was placed on a non-rebreather mask at 15L. At 0630, his SpO2 improved to 90%, but his RR is 34, HR is 120, and BP is 150/90. Arterial blood gas (ABG) was ordered. He appears anxious and restless. The physician was notified and further orders are anticipated. At 0700, ABG results are pending, but his condition is worsening despite increased oxygen delivery, and lung compliance is decreasing. Based on current assessment, respiratory support is critical.",
