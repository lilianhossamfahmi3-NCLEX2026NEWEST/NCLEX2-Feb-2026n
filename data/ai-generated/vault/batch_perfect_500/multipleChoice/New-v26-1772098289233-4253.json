        "correct": "Iron stores are essential for the effectiveness of epoetin alfa. Epoetin alfa stimulates red blood cell production, a process that requires iron. If iron stores are low, the medication will not be as effective in stimulating erythropoiesis, leading to a suboptimal response and continued anemia. Monitoring serum iron levels ensures that adequate iron is available to support the increased red blood cell production induced by epoetin alfa.",
        "mnemonic": "Epoetin Alfa needs Iron (EA-I)",
        "incorrect": "While BUN and creatinine are important indicators of kidney function, they do not directly impact the effectiveness of epoetin alfa. Potassium levels are important to monitor in CKD, but not the priority before administering epoetin alfa. White blood cell count is not directly related to the effectiveness of epoetin alfa.",
        "questionTrap": "The question traps the test taker into thinking about kidney function (BUN, Creatinine) or electrolyte imbalances (Potassium) common in CKD, rather than the specific requirements for epoetin alfa to work. Test takers may focus on the kidney disease itself rather than the medication's mechanism of action.",
