    "correct": "Administering a bronchodilator medication, such as albuterol, is the priority intervention to open the airways and improve breathing. The patient is experiencing an asthma exacerbation, and bronchodilators are the first-line treatment to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow.",
    "incorrect": "While oxygen administration is important, it is not the priority over opening the airways with a bronchodilator. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, but addressing the bronchospasm will improve oxygenation more effectively. Monitoring vital signs is important, but it should not delay the administration of a bronchodilator. Encouraging oral fluids is important for hydration, but it is not the priority in an acute asthma exacerbation where the patient is experiencing significant respiratory distress.",
