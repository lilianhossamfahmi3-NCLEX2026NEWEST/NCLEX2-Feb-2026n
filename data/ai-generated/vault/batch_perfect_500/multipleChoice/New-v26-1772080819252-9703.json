    "correct": "Immediate assessment of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is crucial. Given the patient's unstable vital signs (hypotension, rapid heart rate, desaturation), this is the priority. Unstable ventricular tachycardia requires prompt intervention.",

      "application": "In this scenario, focusing on the ABCs guides the nurse to prioritize assessment and stabilization before further interventions."
    },
    "incorrect": "While administering amiodarone is a potential treatment for ventricular tachycardia, it is not the *initial* priority. Assessing ABCs and the patient's stability comes first. The physician needs to be notified, but not before assessing the patient. Checking potassium is important in cardiac patients, but secondary to assessing ABCs and determining the stability of the patient. Documenting the event is important but follows immediate assessment and intervention.",
