This position facilitates drainage and reduces the likelihood of secretions entering the respiratory tract. Given the client's current status, purulent secretions, and elevated temperature, prioritizing aspiration prevention is paramount.

While improving oxygenation is important, VAP prevention takes precedence given the client's risk factors. High FiO2 levels can contribute to oxygen toxicity. \n\nPerforming oral care every 8 hours is insufficient. Oral care should be performed at least every 2-4 hours to reduce bacterial colonization in the oral cavity, a major risk factor for VAP. The SBAR indicates it has already been three hours since the last oral care.\n\nChanging the ventilator circuit tubing daily is not recommended. Current guidelines suggest changing the tubing only when visibly soiled or malfunctioning to minimize the risk of introducing new pathogens.",

He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation at 07:00 this morning due to worsening respiratory status.\n\nA: Current ventilator settings are: FiO2 60%, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Respiratory Rate 16, and PEEP 5 cm H2O. An arterial blood gas (ABG) drawn at 10:00 showed: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, and HCO3 26 mEq/L. Oral care was last performed at 08:00. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F) at 11:00. Upon suctioning, purulent secretions were noted. The last suctioning was performed at 10:30. The patient is currently receiving continuous sedation with propofol.\n\nP: I am requesting recommendations to optimize ventilation and implement strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), considering his current clinical condition and lab results. Should we consider adjusting the ventilator settings or initiating antibiotic therapy?",
