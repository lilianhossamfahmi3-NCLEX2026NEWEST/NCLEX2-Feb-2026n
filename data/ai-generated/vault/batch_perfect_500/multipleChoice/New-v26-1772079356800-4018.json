    "incorrect": "Increasing the FiO2 further is unlikely to be effective if the patient is not ventilating adequately. The PaO2 is low, but addressing the hypercapnia is the priority. Administering a bronchodilator is already a scheduled intervention, and the patient is likely already receiving its benefits. While calling the respiratory therapist is important, the *first* action should be to improve the patient's ventilation immediately. Waiting for the therapist delays critical intervention.",
