Critically, the client's hypokalemia (Potassium 3.2 mEq/L) potentiates digoxin's effect. Digoxin and potassium compete for the same binding sites on the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in cardiac myocytes. When potassium is low, more binding sites are available for digoxin, which dangerously enhances its cardiotoxic effects. Withholding the dose prevents further toxicity, and notifying the provider is essential to initiate corrective measures, such as potassium replacement and potential administration of digoxin immune Fab."
