    "content": "The primary cognitive trap is choosing a medication that treats the root cause (PTU blocking hormone production) over the medication that treats the most immediate life-threatening consequence (Propranolol blocking cardiac effects). In a crisis, the nurse must stabilize the patient by addressing the most immediate threat to life—in this case, cardiovascular collapse from hyperadrenergic stimulation. The NCLEX frequently tests the ability to differentiate between definitive treatment and emergency stabilization, with stabilization almost always taking precedence."
