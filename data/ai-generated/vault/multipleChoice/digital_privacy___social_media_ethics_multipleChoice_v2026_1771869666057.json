    "stem": "A registered nurse (RN) working in a large metropolitan hospital is friends with several patients on social media. One of these patients, a 34-year-old female recovering from a motor vehicle accident with significant orthopedic injuries, posts a concerning update stating she feels hopeless and overwhelmed by her slow recovery. The patient also mentions feeling abandoned by her family and expresses thoughts of self-harm. The RN sees this post outside of work hours. Which of the following actions should the RN prioritize FIRST, considering both ethical and legal obligations?",

    ],
    "rationale": "The ethical and legal obligations of a registered nurse extend beyond the physical boundaries of the hospital setting, especially when information obtained outside of work indicates a potential risk to patient safety. In this scenario, the patient's social media post expressing feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm constitutes a serious concern that demands immediate action. Reporting the post to the nursing supervisor and the mental health crisis team ensures that qualified professionals can promptly assess the patient's risk, provide appropriate mental health support, and implement necessary safety measures. This aligns with the principles of beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm), as well as the nurse's duty of care. Ignoring the post or taking actions that delay intervention, such as contacting the patient directly via social media or sharing the post with other nurses without immediate action, could have detrimental consequences for the patient's well-being and expose the nurse to legal liability. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) also plays a crucial role; even though the patient posted on social media, the nurse's professional duty dictates a careful and ethical response that prioritizes patient safety while respecting privacy where possible. The correct action balances the need for immediate intervention with the obligation to protect patient confidentiality within the bounds of ethical and legal standards.",
