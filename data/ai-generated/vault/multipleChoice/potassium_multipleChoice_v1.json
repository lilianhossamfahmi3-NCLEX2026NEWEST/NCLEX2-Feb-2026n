Rapid administration of concentrated potassium can cause severe hyperkalemia, leading to cardiac arrest. The rapid increase in extracellular potassium depolarizes cardiac cell membranes, disrupting the normal cardiac action potential and causing asystole. This method bypasses the body's ability to regulate potassium levels, resulting in a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. **Clinical Pearl:** Never administer potassium IV push.

Inadequate renal function can lead to hyperkalemia as the infused potassium accumulates in the body. Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and ultimately ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Adequate urine output indicates the kidneys' ability to excrete the administered potassium, preventing iatrogenic hyperkalemia. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor urine output closely during potassium infusions, especially in patients with renal impairment.",

High concentrations increase the risk of endothelial damage, leading to pain, burning, and potential venous sclerosis. Peripheral infusions should typically be limited to concentrations of 10-40 mEq/L to minimize vein irritation. Higher concentrations are typically administered via a central venous catheter, where the larger blood volume allows for rapid dilution. **Clinical Pearl:** Always dilute potassium chloride appropriately for peripheral administration to prevent phlebitis.",

The question asks for the essential action *prior* to starting, making the assessment of renal function the top priority.",
