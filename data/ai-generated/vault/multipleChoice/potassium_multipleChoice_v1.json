            "content": "Administering potassium chloride via IV push is a lethal action. This method delivers a hyperconcentrated bolus of potassium directly into the central circulation, causing an immediate, massive increase in serum potassium levels. This extreme hyperkalemia instantly neutralizes the cardiac cell resting membrane potential, leading to a complete cessation of electrical activity and causing fatal cardiac arrest (asystole). It is an absolute contraindication."

            "content": "This is the correct and most essential safety action. Over 90% of the body's potassium is excreted by the kidneys. Verifying a minimum urinary output of 30 mL/hr confirms adequate renal function. If the patient is oliguric or anuric, the kidneys cannot excrete the infused potassium, leading to a rapid accumulation in the blood (iatrogenic hyperkalemia). This can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, by altering the cardiac action potential."

Gravity-based systems are prone to inaccurate flow rates due to changes in patient position or venous pressure, creating a high risk of accidental rapid infusion (a 'runaway' drip). An uncontrolled bolus of potassium can be as fatal as an IV push. An electronic infusion pump is mandatory to ensure a precise, controlled, and safe rate of administration."

Concentrations for peripheral IV infusion should not exceed 40 mEq/L (and are often further diluted to 10-20 mEq/L) to prevent severe phlebitis and endothelial damage to the vein. A concentration of 100 mEq/L would cause intense pain, burning, and almost certain venous sclerosis. Such high concentrations are reserved for administration through a central venous catheter, where the large blood volume of a central vein provides rapid dilution."

The question asks for the essential action *prior* to starting, making the assessment of renal function the top priority.",
