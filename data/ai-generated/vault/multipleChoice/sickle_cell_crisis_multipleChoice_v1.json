Hydration is the priority intervention to reduce blood viscosity and promote the movement of red blood cells through the microvasculature. Increasing fluid intake helps 'flush out' the sickled cells and minimize further clumping.",

Cold compresses should be avoided as they cause vasoconstriction, which worsens the sickling. Active range of motion can increase metabolic demand and is too painful during an acute crisis; the joint should be rested.",
