    "stem": "A 68-year-old male is admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) following a fall resulting in a subdural hematoma. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is currently 8. The patient's condition is being closely monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Review the provided information and determine the appropriate nursing interventions.",

      "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. Johnson, 68-year-old male, admitted at 14:30 today due to a fall at home causing a subdural hematoma. GCS is 8.\n\nBackground: Patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He takes aspirin daily for cardiovascular prophylaxis. CT scan confirmed a subdural hematoma with midline shift. Neurosurgeon is aware.\n\nAssessment: At 15:00, patient's vital signs are: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10, irregular, SpO2 92% on room air. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil more dilated and sluggishly reactive. Noted diminished motor response on the left side. ICP monitoring was initiated with a current reading of 22 mmHg. Intermittent episodes of agitation noted. CSF drainage in place, draining slowly.\n\nRecommendation: Continuous ICP monitoring, manage blood pressure and respiratory status, prevent secondary injury, and anticipate potential surgical intervention. Frequent neurological assessments are required. Consider mannitol or hypertonic saline administration per protocol. Strict I/O monitoring and DVT prophylaxis should be initiated. Re-evaluate GCS in one hour.",

      "correct": "The patient exhibits signs of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations) indicative of increased ICP. Administering mannitol reduces ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Close monitoring of urine output is necessary as mannitol is an osmotic diuretic. Given the patient's declining GCS and signs of herniation, preparing for potential surgical intervention is crucial to evacuate the hematoma and relieve pressure on the brain. The irregular respiratory rate and GCS of 8 indicate a need to prepare for intubation to secure the airway and optimize ventilation. Contacting the Rapid Response Team is vital because the patient is exhibiting signs of neurological deterioration and requires immediate intervention. Continuous neurological assessment (document and monitor) are essential to track the patient's response to interventions and detect further deterioration.",
