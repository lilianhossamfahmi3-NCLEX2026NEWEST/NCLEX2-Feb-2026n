        "stem": "A 68-year-old male is admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) following a fall resulting in a subdural hematoma. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is currently 8. The patient's condition is being closely monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Review the provided information and determine the appropriate nursing interventions.",

            "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. Johnson, a 68-year-old male, was admitted at 14:30 today following a fall at home, resulting in a subdural hematoma. His current GCS is 8.\n\nBackground: The patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and takes aspirin daily for cardiovascular prophylaxis. A CT scan confirmed a subdural hematoma with a midline shift. The neurosurgeon has been notified.\n\nAssessment: At 15:00, the patient's vital signs are: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10 and irregular, SpO2 92% on room air. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil more dilated and sluggishly reactive. Diminished motor response is noted on the left side. ICP monitoring was initiated, with a current reading of 22 mmHg. Intermittent episodes of agitation have been observed. CSF drainage is in place, draining slowly.\n\nRecommendation: Continue continuous ICP monitoring, manage blood pressure and respiratory status, prevent secondary injury, and anticipate potential surgical intervention. Frequent neurological assessments are required. Consider administering mannitol or hypertonic saline per protocol. Strict I/O monitoring and DVT prophylaxis should be initiated. Re-evaluate GCS in one hour.",

            "correct": "The patient exhibits signs of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), indicative of increased ICP. Administering mannitol reduces ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, decreasing cerebral edema. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Close monitoring of urine output is necessary as mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, and fluid balance is critical. Given the patient's declining GCS and signs of herniation, preparing for potential surgical intervention is crucial to evacuate the hematoma and relieve pressure on the brain. The irregular respiratory rate and GCS of 8 indicate a need to prepare for intubation to secure the airway and optimize ventilation. Contacting the Rapid Response Team is vital because the patient is exhibiting signs of neurological deterioration and requires immediate intervention. Continuous neurological assessment (document and monitor) are essential to track the patient's response to interventions and detect further deterioration.",
            "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of normal saline can increase intravascular volume, potentially worsening cerebral edema and increasing ICP. Administering a beta-blocker to reduce blood pressure without addressing the underlying increased ICP can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion. Positioning the patient in Trendelenburg position increases ICP by impeding venous drainage from the brain. Increasing stimulation to assess level of consciousness is contraindicated as it can exacerbate increased ICP.",

Subdural hematomas can rapidly increase ICP, leading to herniation and death if not promptly managed. Early recognition and treatment are critical for improving patient outcomes. Never administer fluids rapidly if increased ICP is suspected, as this can exacerbate cerebral edema."
