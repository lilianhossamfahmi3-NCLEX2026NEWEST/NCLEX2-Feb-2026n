    "correct": "Cushing's triad is a late sign of increased ICP and indicates impending brain herniation. It is characterized by hypertension with a widening pulse pressure (increased systolic and decreased diastolic), bradycardia (decreased heart rate), and irregular respirations (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes). Recognizing these signs promptly allows for immediate intervention to reduce ICP and prevent further neurological damage. The presence of all three components is crucial for identifying Cushing's triad.",
    "incorrect": "Hypotension, tachycardia, and rapid respirations are signs of shock, not increased ICP. Fever, tachycardia, and flushed skin are signs of infection or inflammation, not increased ICP. Hypertension, tachycardia, and bounding pulse may indicate fluid overload or pain, but not specifically Cushing's triad.",
