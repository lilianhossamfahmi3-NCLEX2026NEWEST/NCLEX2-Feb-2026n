    "pathophysiology": "Small cell lung cancer can cause SIADH, leading to excess ADH production. This results in increased water reabsorption in the kidneys, diluting serum sodium levels (hyponatremia) despite normal or increased total body water. Urine osmolality is inappropriately high relative to serum osmolality, and urine specific gravity is elevated due to concentrated urine. Untreated, severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death.",
    "questionTrap": "The trap is 'sodium-chasing'. Hyponatremia often triggers the urge to administer sodium. However, in SIADH, the problem is excess water, not sodium deficit. Administering hypotonic (0.45% NS) fluids provides more free water for ADH to reabsorb, worsening hyponatremia and increasing cerebral edema risk.",
    "mnemonics": "SIADH: 'Soaked Inside' - Low serum sodium, low serum osmolality, high urine specific gravity, high urine osmolality. Treatment: Fluid restriction.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for signs of fluid overload (edema, weight gain, crackles in lungs). Implement seizure precautions. Frequent neuro checks are essential. Severe hyponatremia may require hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) administered slowly in an ICU setting. Demeclocycline or vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) may be used long-term to inhibit ADH action."

    {
      "optionId": "a",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Fluid restriction is the priority intervention for SIADH. The hyponatremia is dilutional, caused by excessive ADH leading to renal water retention. Restricting free water intake to less than daily urine output (typically <800-1000 mL/day) creates a negative water balance, promoting excretion of excess water and gradually increasing serum sodium. Monitor sodium levels closely to avoid overly rapid correction, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)."

    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Administering 0.45% Normal Saline (hypotonic) would worsen the patient's condition. In SIADH, the kidneys retain free water due to high ADH levels. Hypotonic fluids provide more free water, further diluting serum sodium and increasing the risk of cerebral edema and seizures. This is contraindicated."

    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. While potassium is important, it's not the priority. The critical issue is the sodium of 122 mEq/L and high urine specific gravity, hallmarks of SIADH and dilutional hyponatremia. Addressing potassium does not correct the underlying water retention and sodium dilution. Focus on the life-threatening hyponatremia first."

    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect and dangerous. 5% Dextrose in water (D5W) is hypotonic after the dextrose is metabolized. Administering free water to a patient with SIADH, who cannot excrete it due to high ADH, will cause a rapid drop in serum sodium, triggering severe neurological complications, including seizures and coma. This is strictly contraindicated."
