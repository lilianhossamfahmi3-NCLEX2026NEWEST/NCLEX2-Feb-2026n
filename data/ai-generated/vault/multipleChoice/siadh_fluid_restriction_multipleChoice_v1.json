    "pathophysiology": "Small cell lung cancer frequently causes Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) via ectopic ADH production. Excess ADH binds to V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts, increasing aquaporin-2 channel insertion. This leads to excessive free water reabsorption, diluting serum sodium (hyponatremia, Na+ < 135 mEq/L) despite normal or increased total body water (euvolemia/hypervolemia). The kidneys attempt compensation via natriuresis, but water retention persists. Urine osmolality is inappropriately high relative to serum osmolality, and urine specific gravity is elevated (>1.030) due to concentrated urine. Untreated, severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death.",
    "questionTrap": "The trap is 'sodium-chasing'. Hyponatremia often triggers the urge to administer sodium. However, in SIADH, the problem is excess water, not sodium deficit. Administering hypotonic (0.45% NS) or isotonic (0.9% NS) fluids provides more free water for ADH to reabsorb, worsening hyponatremia and increasing cerebral edema risk.",
    "mnemonics": "SIADH: 'Soaked Inside' - Low serum sodium, low serum osmolality, high urine specific gravity, high urine osmolality. Treatment: Fluid restriction.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for signs of fluid overload (edema, weight gain, crackles in lungs). Implement seizure precautions. Frequent neuro checks are essential. Severe hyponatremia may require hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) administered slowly in an ICU setting. Demeclocycline or vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) may be used long-term to inhibit ADH action."

    {
      "optionId": "a",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Fluid restriction is the priority intervention for SIADH. The hyponatremia is dilutional, caused by excessive ADH leading to renal water retention. Restricting free water intake to less than daily urine output (typically <800-1000 mL/day) creates a negative water balance. The body excretes excess water, gradually increasing serum sodium and decreasing total body water. This directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology. Monitor sodium levels closely to avoid overly rapid correction, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)."

    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Administering 0.45% Normal Saline (hypotonic) would worsen the patient's condition. In SIADH, the kidneys retain free water due to high ADH levels. Hypotonic fluids provide more free water, further diluting serum sodium and increasing the risk of cerebral edema, seizures, and brainstem herniation. This is contraindicated."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. While potassium is important, it's not the priority. The critical issue is the sodium of 122 mEq/L and high urine specific gravity, hallmarks of SIADH and dilutional hyponatremia. Addressing potassium does not correct the underlying water retention and sodium dilution. Focus on the life-threatening hyponatremia first."

    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect and dangerous. 5% Dextrose in water (D5W) is isotonic initially but becomes hypotonic after infusion because the dextrose is rapidly metabolized, leaving only free water. Administering free water to a patient with SIADH, who cannot excrete it due to high ADH, will cause a rapid drop in serum sodium, triggering severe neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and death from acute cerebral edema. This is strictly contraindicated."
