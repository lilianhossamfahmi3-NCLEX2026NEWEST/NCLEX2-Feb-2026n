His blood pressure is 198/112 mmHg, and heart rate is 110 bpm. A STAT chest CT confirms a Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Which intravenous infusion should the nurse prioritize titrating to achieve immediate hemodynamic goals?",

In aortic dissection, the primary goal is to decrease aortic wall shear stress by reducing the rate of rise of systolic pressure (dP/dt) and absolute blood pressure. Esmolol achieves this by exerting negative chronotropic (decreased heart rate) and negative inotropic (decreased myocardial contractility) effects. Reducing the velocity of left ventricular ejection is critical to prevent dissection flap propagation. Target HR <60 bpm and SBP between 100-120 mmHg. Continuous BP monitoring is essential during esmolol titration. Watch for hypotension and adjust accordingly. Notify provider for SBP < 100 mmHg."
