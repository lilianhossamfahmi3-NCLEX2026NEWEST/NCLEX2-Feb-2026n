      "optionId": "a",
      "content": "Esmolol, a short-acting intravenous beta-1 selective adrenergic antagonist, is the priority medication. In aortic dissection, the primary goal is to decrease aortic wall shear stress by reducing the rate of rise of systolic pressure (dP/dt) and absolute blood pressure. Esmolol achieves this by exerting negative chronotropic (decreased heart rate) and negative inotropic (decreased myocardial contractility) effects. Reducing the velocity of left ventricular ejection is critical to prevent dissection flap propagation. Target HR <60 bpm and SBP between 100-120 mmHg. ClinicalPearl: Continuous BP monitoring is essential during esmolol titration. Watch for hypotension and adjust accordingly. Notify provider for SBP < 100 mmHg.",
      "rationale": "Stanford Type A aortic dissections involve the ascending aorta, posing a high risk of life-threatening complications like aortic rupture, stroke, or cardiac tamponade. The high blood pressure and heart rate exacerbate the shearing forces on the weakened aortic wall, promoting further dissection. Esmolol reduces these forces, preventing further damage and stabilizing the patient for definitive surgical intervention. The beta-1 selectivity minimizes bronchospasm risk, important if the patient has underlying pulmonary issues."

      {
        "optionId": "b",
        "content": "Dobutamine is a beta-1 adrenergic agonist that increases myocardial contractility (positive inotropy) and heart rate. Dobutamine would dangerously increase dP/dt, propagating the aortic dissection, potentially leading to aortic rupture and pericardial tamponade. ClinicalPearl: Dobutamine is contraindicated in aortic dissection unless severe cardiogenic shock is present and after adequate beta blockade.",
        "rationale": "Dobutamine's mechanism of action directly opposes the therapeutic goals in aortic dissection. By increasing myocardial contractility and heart rate, it elevates the shearing forces on the aortic wall, accelerating the dissection process and increasing the risk of catastrophic rupture. This is due to increased oxygen demand and increased force of ventricular ejection against the weakened aortic wall."

      {
        "optionId": "c",
        "content": "Heparin is a potent anticoagulant. Aortic dissection involves a tear in the aortic intima, creating a false lumen filled with blood. Heparin would inhibit the clotting cascade, preventing hemostasis at the tear site, leading to uncontrolled bleeding into the false lumen, dissection expansion, and a high risk of fatal aortic rupture. ClinicalPearl: Review patient's medication list for any anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Hold these medications and clarify with the provider.",
        "rationale": "Anticoagulation with heparin is absolutely contraindicated in the acute setting of aortic dissection. The pathophysiology involves a tear in the aortic wall, and anticoagulation would exacerbate bleeding into the false lumen, leading to rapid expansion of the dissection and increased risk of rupture. The goal is to prevent further bleeding and stabilize the aortic wall, not to promote anticoagulation."

        "optionId": "d",
        "content": "Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor with strong alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic agonist effects. It causes profound peripheral vasoconstriction, drastically increasing systemic vascular resistance and afterload, further elevating critical hypertension. Beta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contractility, increasing dP/dt. This combination places intolerable mechanical stress on the weakened aortic wall, accelerating dissection and likely causing rupture. ClinicalPearl: Norepinephrine should be avoided unless the patient is hypotensive despite beta-blockade.",
        "rationale": "Norepinephrine's combined alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic effects are detrimental in aortic dissection. The alpha-1 mediated vasoconstriction increases afterload and blood pressure, while the beta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contractility. Both of these effects increase the shearing forces on the aortic wall, promoting further dissection and increasing the risk of rupture. The increased afterload also increases myocardial oxygen demand, potentially leading to ischemia."

  "questionTrap": {
    "type": "Pathophysiological Misdirection",
    "explanation": "The primary trap is misinterpreting the hemodynamic goals. While the hypertension is severe, simply lowering blood pressure with a pure vasodilator (like nitroprusside) without first controlling heart rate is dangerous. Vasodilation can cause reflex tachycardia, which increases dP/dt and worsens the shear stress. The core principle is 'anti-impulse therapy'—rate and contractility control must precede or accompany blood pressure reduction. Therefore, a beta-blocker like esmolol is always the first-line agent, directly targeting the primary mechanical force extending the tear.",
    "clinicalPearl": "If using nitroprusside, ensure adequate beta-blockade is in place to prevent reflex tachycardia."
