While serum lipase may be elevated due to the systemic release and breakdown of fat globules, this finding is neither specific nor consistently present in all patients with Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES). The diagnostic utility of serum lipase is controversial, and it does not reflect the severity of the life-threatening pulmonary injury."

            "optionId": "b",
            "content": "Incorrect. Serum calcium may decrease (hypocalcemia) in FES. This occurs because free fatty acids, released from the breakdown of fat emboli, bind with ionized calcium in a process called saponification. However, this is a secondary metabolic consequence and is not as immediate or critical as the profound respiratory failure that defines the syndrome."

            "optionId": "c",
            "content": "Incorrect. The platelet count characteristically decreases (thrombocytopenia), it does not increase. Fat globules entering the circulation damage the endothelium and trigger platelet aggregation. Platelets adhere to the fat emboli, leading to their consumption. This consumptive thrombocytopenia, combined with capillary damage, contributes directly to the formation of the characteristic petechial rash."

        {
            "optionId": "d",
            "content": "Correct. A decreased PaO2 (hypoxemia) is the earliest and most consistent finding in FES. The pathophysiology is twofold: 1) Mechanical obstruction of pulmonary capillaries by fat globules creates a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. 2) The biochemical breakdown of fat into free fatty acids causes a severe inflammatory response, damaging alveolar-capillary membranes. This leads to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, surfactant inactivation, and intrapulmonary shunting, resulting in severe hypoxemia that is often refractory to high concentrations of supplemental oxygen."
