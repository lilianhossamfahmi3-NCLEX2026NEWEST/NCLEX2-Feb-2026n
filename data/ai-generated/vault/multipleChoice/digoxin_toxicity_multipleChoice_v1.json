                "content": "Incorrect. Furosemide can cause hyponatremia through renal excretion of sodium. However, sodium levels do not directly potentiate digoxin's effect on the myocardium. The primary mechanism of digoxin toxicity is related to its interaction with the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, where potassium concentration is the critical factor. Verifying the sodium level does not address the immediate life-threatening risk of cardiac arrhythmia from digoxin toxicity."

                "content": "Correct. The patient's symptoms (nausea, xanthopsia/'yellow halos') are classic signs of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin exerts its effect by binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in myocardial cells, competing with potassium for the same binding sites. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, causes significant potassium loss (hypokalemia). When serum potassium is low, there are more available binding sites for digoxin, which dramatically increases its binding and inhibitory effect on the pump. This leads to increased intracellular calcium, causing dangerous cardiac dysrhythmias. Verifying the serum potassium level is the most critical action to confirm the likely cause of the toxicity and guide immediate intervention to prevent a fatal arrhythmia."

While important for managing the underlying chronic condition, it does not address the acute medication toxicity that the patient is exhibiting. The reported symptoms point to a cellular-level problem (digoxin's effect on the myocardium), not a systemic fluid volume problem. The immediate risk is a cardiac electrical disturbance, which has a higher priority than assessing fluid balance."

This is an important assessment for the patient's overall cardiac status. However, the patient's specific complaints of nausea and visual disturbances are hallmark signs of digoxin toxicity, not fluid overload. The acute, life-threatening risk is a fatal arrhythmia from the drug's toxic effect, which is directly exacerbated by low potassium. Addressing the potential toxicity is the immediate priority over assessing for signs of chronic disease exacerbation."

        "questionTrap": "The primary trap in this question is choosing between assessing the patient's chronic disease (heart failure) versus an acute, iatrogenic complication (medication toxicity). Options 'c' and 'd' (weight and crackles) are correct assessments for heart failure but are not the priority when classic signs of digoxin toxicity are present. The concurrent use of furosemide is a critical cue that points directly to hypokalemia as the most probable trigger for the toxicity. The test-taker must prioritize the acute, life-threatening condition over routine disease management assessments.",
        "mnemonics": "For Digoxin Toxicity, remember 'DIGS LOW K+'\n\n- **D**ysrhythmias (bradycardia, heart block)\n- **I**ntestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, anorexia - earliest signs)\n- **G**eneral malaise (fatigue, confusion)\n- **S**ight disturbances (xanthopsia - yellow/green halos, blurred vision)\n\n- **LOW K+**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte imbalance that precipitates digoxin toxicity. The lower the potassium, the higher the risk of toxicity."
