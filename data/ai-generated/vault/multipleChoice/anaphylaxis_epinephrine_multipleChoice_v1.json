            "content": "This is the correct first action. Stopping the antibiotic infusion removes the triggering antigen, halting further mast cell and basophil degranulation. Administering IM epinephrine is the critical, life-saving intervention. Epinephrine's alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause potent vasoconstriction, reversing the peripheral vasodilation and capillary leakage that lead to hypotension and angioedema. Its beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, directly counteracting the histamine- and leukotriene-induced bronchospasm causing the wheezing. Its beta-1 effects increase heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output and vital organ perfusion."

            "optionId": "b",
            "content": "This action is incorrect as the first step. While activating the Rapid Response Team is essential, it consumes critical time during which the patient's airway can completely close. The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis progresses in seconds to minutes. Delaying the administration of epinephrine to wait for the team's arrival would allow unopposed vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and laryngeal edema to worsen, potentially leading to irreversible cardiovascular collapse or respiratory arrest. An ECG is a diagnostic tool, not a therapeutic intervention; it can be obtained after life-saving measures are initiated."

            "optionId": "d",
            "content": "This action is incorrect as the first step. Diphenhydramine is a second-line H1-receptor antagonist. It is effective for treating the cutaneous manifestations of anaphylaxis (hives, itching) by blocking histamine receptors, but it does not reverse life-threatening bronchospasm or hypotension. The primary mediators of bronchoconstriction in anaphylaxis are leukotrienes and prostaglandins, which are not affected by antihistamines. Furthermore, its onset of action is significantly slower than IM epinephrine. Relying on diphenhydramine first fails to address the immediate threats to airway and circulation."

            "optionId": "c",
            "content": "This action is incorrect as the first step. Applying oxygen is a supportive measure, but it is ineffective if the airway is physically obstructed. The patient's wheezing and dyspnea are due to severe bronchoconstriction and mucosal edema, which prevent oxygen from reaching the alveoli. Epinephrine must be given first to open the airways via its potent beta-2 agonist effects. Once the airways are patent, supplemental oxygen will be beneficial. Performing a lung assessment (auscultation) before intervening wastes precious time when the clinical signs (audible wheezing) already confirm severe airway compromise requiring immediate pharmacological reversal."

        "content": "The primary trap in this question is the reflexive application of the 'ABCs' (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) without considering the underlying cause. A test-taker might see 'dyspneic with wheezing' and choose oxygen ('B' for Breathing) as the first priority. However, in anaphylaxis, the problem is not a lack of oxygen in the air, but a physiological inability for air to enter the lungs and for the circulatory system to function. The true priority is to administer the medication (Epinephrine) that reverses the pathophysiology causing the A, B, and C problems simultaneously. In anaphylaxis, the saying is often modified to '(D)rug first' to correct the life-threatening cascade."
