Both assessing for the cause (palpating the bladder) and administering medication are valid components of managing autonomic dysreflexia. However, the most immediate, life-saving, and non-pharmacological intervention is to sit the patient upright to mechanically lower the blood pressure. The trap is prioritizing assessment or medication over the immediate physical maneuver that mitigates the hypertensive crisis."

      "content": "**Rationale:** This is the priority action. Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a life-threatening emergency unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. A noxious stimulus *below* the level of injury (e.g., bladder distention, fecal impaction, pressure ulcer) triggers an exaggerated, unopposed sympathetic nervous system response. Because the spinal cord injury prevents the brain from receiving and processing these signals normally, the body cannot regulate the sympathetic surge. This results in massive vasoconstriction *below* the level of injury, leading to a rapid and dangerous rise in blood pressure. The body attempts to compensate via the parasympathetic nervous system, causing bradycardia and vasodilation *above* the level of injury (flushing, headache). However, the spinal cord injury blocks the parasympathetic signals from reaching *below* the injury, perpetuating the hypertensive crisis. Raising the HOB to 90 degrees utilizes gravity to induce orthostatic hypotension. This decreases venous return, reduces cardiac preload, and lowers systemic blood pressure, mitigating the risk of stroke, seizure, or death. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize interventions that directly address the immediate threat to the patient's life. In AD, the uncontrolled hypertension is the primary danger.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** Patient with T4 SCI reporting severe headache at 1400, BP 210/110, flushed above injury.\n*   **Background:** Patient has history of autonomic dysreflexia. Vital signs stable prior to 1400.\n*   **Assessment:** Patient is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. BP critically elevated.\n*   **Recommendation:** Elevate HOB to 90 degrees immediately. Assess for and remove noxious stimuli (bladder, bowel, skin). Monitor BP every 5 minutes. Prepare to administer antihypertensive medication if BP remains elevated after stimulus removal. Notify provider.",

      "content": "**Rationale:** Administering hydralazine is a secondary intervention. The primary goal is to identify and remove the noxious stimulus causing the sympathetic surge. Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator that reduces blood pressure by relaxing smooth muscle in blood vessels. However, if medication is given *before* the stimulus is removed, the combined effect of vasodilation from the drug and the sudden cessation of sympathetic outflow (once the stimulus is gone) can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure, leading to severe rebound hypotension and inadequate cerebral perfusion. Furthermore, addressing the underlying cause is crucial to prevent recurrence. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Treat the cause, not just the symptom. Medication is a temporary fix; removing the stimulus provides a more lasting solution.\n\n**SBAR:** (If this were the *first* action)\n*   **Situation:** Patient with T4 SCI reporting severe headache at 1400, BP 210/110, flushed above injury.\n*   **Background:** Patient has history of autonomic dysreflexia.

The patient's blood pressure of 210/110 mmHg constitutes a hypertensive emergency. Leaving the patient supine to palpate the abdomen prolongs the period of extreme hypertension and high intracranial pressure. The nurse must first intervene to lower the blood pressure by raising the head of the bed, and then *simultaneously or immediately after*, proceed with assessing for and removing the stimulus.
