Both assessing for the cause (palpating the bladder) and administering medication are valid components of managing autonomic dysreflexia. However, the most immediate, life-saving, and non-pharmacological intervention is to sit the patient upright to mechanically lower the blood pressure. The trap is prioritizing assessment or medication over the immediate physical maneuver that mitigates the hypertensive crisis."

            "content": "This is the priority action. In autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a noxious stimulus below the T6 spinal cord injury level triggers an unopposed sympathetic surge, causing intense vasoconstriction below the injury and a rapid, dangerous rise in blood pressure. The body's compensatory parasympathetic response is blocked by the injury. Placing the patient in a high-Fowler's position (90 degrees) utilizes gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension, pooling blood in the lower extremities. This immediately decreases venous return, reduces cardiac preload, and lowers systemic blood pressure, directly mitigating the risk of a hypertensive crisis, such as a cerebrovascular accident or seizure, while the nurse searches for the underlying cause."

            "content": "Calling the healthcare provider is necessary, but it is not the immediate priority nursing action. AD is a life-threatening emergency that requires swift, independent nursing interventions to prevent catastrophic outcomes like stroke. The nurse must first initiate actions within their scope of practice, primarily repositioning the patient to lower the blood pressure. Delaying this action to make a phone call allows the dangerous hypertension to persist, increasing the risk of end-organ damage."

If medication is given before the stimulus (e.g., a distended bladder) is removed, the combined effect of vasodilation from the drug and the sudden cessation of sympathetic outflow (once the stimulus is gone) can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure, leading to severe rebound hypotension and inadequate cerebral perfusion."

The patient's blood pressure of 210/110 mmHg constitutes a hypertensive emergency. Leaving the patient supine to palpate the abdomen prolongs the period of extreme hypertension and high intracranial pressure. The nurse must first intervene to lower the blood pressure by raising the head of the bed, and then simultaneously or immediately after, proceed with assessing for and removing the stimulus."
