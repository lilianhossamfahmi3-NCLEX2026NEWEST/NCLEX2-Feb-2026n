      "SBAR": "14:00 - Situation: Mr. Jones, a 62-year-old male, arrived via ambulance reporting severe chest pain. Chief complaint is crushing chest pain, rated 9/10, radiating to the left arm and jaw, onset approximately 2 hours prior. Background: Patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He reports taking lisinopril and atorvastatin daily. Assessment: Patient is diaphoretic, anxious, and appears to be in significant distress. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Patient states, \"I think I'm having a heart attack!\" Recommendation: Immediate interventions are needed, including oxygen administration, pain management, and cardiac monitoring. Cardiology has been notified, and the cath lab team is on standby. Consider administration of aspirin and nitroglycerin per protocol. Continuous assessment and monitoring are crucial. Prepare for potential emergent PCI.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "While oxygen administration is important, aiming for SpO2 > 95% via nasal cannula may not be sufficient given the patient's respiratory distress and potential for hypoxemia. Higher flow rates or alternative oxygen delivery methods might be needed."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and relieving chest pain. It's crucial to monitor blood pressure closely, as nitroglycerin can cause hypotension, especially in patients with right ventricular infarction. This addresses the immediate chest pain and improves coronary blood flow."

        "rationale": "A 12-lead ECG is essential for identifying ST-segment elevation, indicating myocardial injury. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection of arrhythmias, which are common complications of acute MI. The ECG findings dictate further treatment strategies, such as emergent PCI or thrombolytic therapy."

        "rationale": "Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to reduce fluid overload. In the context of acute MI without evidence of pulmonary edema or heart failure, administering furosemide is not indicated and could potentially worsen hypotension and decrease cardiac output due to excessive fluid removal. It does not directly address the primary problem of myocardial ischemia."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Given the ST-segment elevation on the ECG, the patient is likely experiencing an STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy for STEMI, aiming to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery as quickly as possible to minimize myocardial damage. Time is muscle in STEMI, so rapid intervention is crucial."

        "rationale": "Morphine sulfate is an effective analgesic that can reduce chest pain and anxiety. It also has a mild vasodilatory effect, which can help reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Administering morphine can help break the pain cycle and promote patient comfort, which is crucial during an acute MI. However, it should be used cautiously due to potential for respiratory depression and hypotension.",
        "toggledOffRationale": "While morphine can be helpful for pain, it should be used with caution due to its potential to mask symptoms and cause respiratory depression or hypotension, especially in patients with right ventricular infarcts."

    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "In acute MI, remember 'MONA': Morphine (for pain), Oxygen (for hypoxemia), Nitroglycerin (for vasodilation), and Aspirin (antiplatelet). Time to reperfusion is critical; PCI should be initiated within 90 minutes of arrival for STEMI patients. Hypotension should be avoided as it may compromise coronary artery perfusion.",
    "questionTrap": "Many students might select oxygen administration without considering the SpO2 target or the need for higher flow rates. Also, the urge to administer furosemide without assessing for fluid overload is a trap. The question requires prioritizing interventions based on the specific ECG findings (ST-segment elevation) and the patient's presentation.",
