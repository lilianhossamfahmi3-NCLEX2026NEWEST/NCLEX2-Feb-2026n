      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. A sausage-shaped mass in the RUQ is indicative of intussusception, not pyloric stenosis. Intussusception involves the telescoping of one bowel segment into another. This creates a palpable, elongated mass. The pathophysiology involves bowel obstruction, inflammation, and potential ischemia.",
      "rationale": "Intussusception presents with a sausage-shaped mass, often accompanied by currant jelly stools. Pyloric stenosis presents with an olive-shaped mass and projectile vomiting.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Differentiate between intussusception and pyloric stenosis based on the location and shape of the palpable mass and stool characteristics."

      "optionId": "b",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. An olive-shaped mass in the epigastric area is a hallmark sign of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). The pathophysiology involves hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle, causing a gastric outlet obstruction. This obstruction leads to forceful, projectile vomiting after feeding. Palpation reveals a firm, mobile, olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region.",
      "rationale": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis causes a palpable olive-shaped mass due to the thickened pyloric muscle. This obstruction leads to projectile vomiting and potential dehydration.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Palpate deeply in the epigastric region, especially after vomiting, to feel the olive-shaped mass. Gentle palpation is crucial to avoid discomfort."

      "optionId": "c",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Currant jelly-like stools are associated with intussusception, not pyloric stenosis. The pathophysiology involves the telescoping bowel causing ischemia and bleeding, resulting in stools containing blood and mucus. In HPS, the obstruction is proximal, leading to infrequent, small stools or constipation.",
      "rationale": "Currant jelly stools indicate intussusception, where bowel ischemia leads to bloody mucus in the stool. Pyloric stenosis typically presents with infrequent stools due to the gastric outlet obstruction.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Assess stool characteristics carefully. Currant jelly stools require immediate intervention to prevent bowel necrosis."

      "optionId": "d",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Visible peristaltic waves are a sign of pyloric stenosis, but they move from left to right, not right to left. The pathophysiology involves the stomach attempting to overcome the pyloric obstruction, resulting in visible waves across the abdomen. The waves are seen moving from the left upper quadrant towards the right upper quadrant.",
      "rationale": "Peristaltic waves in pyloric stenosis move from left to right as the stomach attempts to force contents through the narrowed pylorus. The direction of the waves is crucial for accurate assessment.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Observe the abdomen for peristaltic waves before palpation. The waves are best seen when the infant is calm and relaxed."
