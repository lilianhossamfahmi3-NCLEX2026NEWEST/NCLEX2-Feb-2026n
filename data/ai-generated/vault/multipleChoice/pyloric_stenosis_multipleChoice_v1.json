    "correct": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. This obstruction results in projectile vomiting. Palpation of the abdomen often reveals a firm, mobile, olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region, which is the hypertrophied pylorus. This finding, combined with the history of projectile vomiting, is highly indicative of HPS."
