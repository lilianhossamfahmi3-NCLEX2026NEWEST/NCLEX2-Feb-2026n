The pathophysiology involves one segment of the bowel telescoping into an adjacent distal segment (the intussusceptum into the intussuscipiens), creating an elongated, sausage-like structure. This is a distinct finding from the small, ovoid mass of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS)."

The pathophysiology involves progressive hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the circular smooth muscle of the pylorus, which narrows the gastric outlet. This thickened muscle creates a firm, mobile, ovoid mass approximately 2 cm in length, which is pathognomonic and feels like an olive upon deep palpation in the epigastric region, just to the right of the umbilicus. Its presence confirms the physical obstruction causing the projectile vomiting."

The pathophysiology stems from the compression of mesenteric vessels within the telescoped bowel, leading to venous obstruction, edema, ischemia, and mucosal bleeding. The mixture of sloughed mucosa, blood, and mucus produces this characteristic stool. In HPS, the obstruction is proximal (at the stomach), so stool is often scant or absent as little food content passes into the intestines."

The pathophysiology involves gastric muscle hypertrophy as the stomach attempts to generate forceful contractions to push contents through the stenotic pylorus. These waves are visible on the infant's thin abdomen moving anatomically from left to right (from the gastric fundus toward the pylorus). The option states 'right to left,' which is physiologically incorrect."

Candidates must differentiate the specific characteristics of the abdominal mass ('olive' vs. 'sausage') and stool ('scant/absent' vs. 'currant jelly'). A secondary trap tests precise anatomical knowledge; knowing that gastric peristalsis moves from left to right is essential to eliminate a plausible but incorrect option."
