    "correct": "The client is exhibiting Cushing's triad, a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The triad consists of hypertension (widening pulse pressure), bradycardia, and irregular respirations. The priority is to immediately notify the healthcare provider about these findings, as they indicate a potentially life-threatening situation requiring urgent intervention to reduce ICP and prevent further brain damage. Rapid intervention is crucial to improve patient outcomes.",
    "incorrect": "Administering oxygen via nasal cannula is a supportive measure but does not address the underlying cause of the vital sign changes. While maintaining adequate oxygenation is important, it is not the priority action in this scenario. Increasing the rate of the IV fluids is contraindicated, as it can exacerbate cerebral edema and further increase ICP. Documenting the findings and reassessing in 30 minutes delays critical intervention and could lead to further neurological deterioration.",
