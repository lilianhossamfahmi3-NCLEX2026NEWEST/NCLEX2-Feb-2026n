The dialysate, rich in glucose and warmed to body temperature, acts as an incubator. This action would accelerate the infectious process, worsen the inflammatory response within the peritoneal cavity, and increase the risk of systemic sepsis. **Pathophysiology:** Prolonged dwell time allows bacteria to multiply, exacerbating the inflammatory response and potentially leading to bacteremia and septic shock. The peritoneal membrane can become damaged, leading to decreased dialysis efficiency and long-term complications.",

The cloudiness is caused by an influx of leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) and fibrin into the peritoneal cavity as the body mounts an inflammatory response to a bacterial pathogen. Obtaining a specimen for culture and sensitivity is the absolute priority. This diagnostic step identifies the specific causative organism and its antibiotic susceptibilities, enabling the initiation of targeted, often intraperitoneal, antibiotic therapy. Prompt treatment is critical to prevent sepsis, preserve the function of the peritoneal membrane, and avoid long-term complications like sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. **Pathophysiology:** Peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis is usually caused by bacterial contamination during catheter insertion, exchange procedures, or exit site infections. The peritoneal membrane becomes inflamed, leading to increased vascular permeability and leakage of fluid, protein, and leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity. This inflammatory response causes abdominal pain, tenderness, and cloudy effluent. Untreated peritonitis can lead to adhesions, fibrosis, and loss of peritoneal membrane function. Sepsis is a major risk.",

Addressing a potential flow problem while ignoring a raging infection is an incorrect prioritization. **Pathophysiology:** Constipation can increase intra-abdominal pressure and potentially impede dialysate flow, but it does not directly cause peritonitis. The cloudy effluent and fever are indicative of an infectious process, requiring immediate attention. Delaying treatment for peritonitis to address constipation can lead to serious complications.",
