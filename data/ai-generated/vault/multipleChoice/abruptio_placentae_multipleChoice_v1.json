            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is the priority action. Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, which severs the maternal-fetal circulatory connection. This separation creates a retroplacental hematoma, which further dissects the placenta away from the uterine decidua, reducing the surface area for gas and nutrient exchange. The resulting uteroplacental insufficiency leads directly to fetal hypoxemia and acidemia. Continuous EFM is the only method to directly assess the fetus's real-time response to this oxygen deprivation, revealing critical signs like late decelerations, bradycardia, or minimal variability, which indicate an urgent need for delivery."

            "correct": false,
            "content": "This action is contraindicated and potentially lethal. Although the clinical picture suggests abruption, placenta previa (where the placenta covers the cervical os) must be formally ruled out by ultrasound before any vaginal examination. A digital exam can puncture the placenta in a previa, causing immediate, catastrophic maternal and fetal hemorrhage. Even with a confirmed abruption, a vaginal exam offers no therapeutic benefit and can worsen the situation by stimulating uterine contractions or dislodging a clot that is providing temporary tamponade, thereby increasing the rate of bleeding."

        "c": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "While preeclampsia is a significant risk factor for abruptio placentae and is assessed via proteinuria, obtaining a urine specimen is not the immediate priority. The patient is experiencing an acute hemorrhagic event causing uterine tetany (the 'board-like' abdomen) and compromised fetal perfusion. The immediate threat to life for both mother and fetus is hemorrhage and hypoxia, respectively. Fetal assessment and maternal hemodynamic stabilization (e.g., IV access, fluid resuscitation) must precede diagnostic tests for underlying conditions. This action addresses a potential cause rather than the life-threatening effect."

        "d": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Applying a warm compress is inappropriate and could be harmful. The severe abdominal pain is caused by uterine muscle ischemia from tetanic contractions and irritation from the expanding retroplacental hematoma. Applying heat induces localized vasodilation. This could theoretically increase blood flow to the site of placental separation, worsening the hemorrhage and increasing intrauterine pressure. Furthermore, it provides no clinical benefit and would delay the implementation of critical, life-saving interventions like fetal monitoring, establishing large-bore IV access, and preparing for an emergency cesarean section."

    "questionTrap": {
        "content": "The primary trap is distinguishing the clinical presentation of abruptio placentae from placenta previa. Abruptio placentae classically presents with severe pain, a rigid/tender uterus, and dark red bleeding. In contrast, placenta previa typically features painless, bright red vaginal bleeding with a soft, non-tender uterus. Another trap is focusing on potential underlying causes (like preeclampsia, which links to option C) instead of managing the acute, life-threatening emergency at hand, which requires immediate fetal and maternal assessment."
