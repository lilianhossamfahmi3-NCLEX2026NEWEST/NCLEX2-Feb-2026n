      "content": "Initiating continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is the priority. The patient's presentation suggests abruptio placentae, a condition where the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall. This compromises fetal oxygenation, making immediate assessment of fetal well-being crucial. EFM provides real-time data on fetal heart rate and patterns, guiding further interventions and informing the healthcare provider about the severity of fetal distress. The SBAR framework emphasizes immediate assessment and recommendation based on the situation."

      "content": "Performing a sterile vaginal exam is contraindicated at this stage. The patient's symptoms could indicate placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os. A vaginal exam in the presence of placenta previa can cause severe maternal and fetal hemorrhage. Placental location must be confirmed via ultrasound before any vaginal examination is performed. This action is potentially dangerous and delays necessary interventions."

      "scoringWeight": 0,
      "content": "Obtaining a urine specimen for protein analysis is relevant for assessing preeclampsia, a risk factor for abruptio placentae. However, it is not the immediate priority. The patient is experiencing an acute event that threatens both maternal and fetal well-being. Addressing the potential underlying cause is secondary to managing the immediate life-threatening complications of hemorrhage and fetal hypoxia. Fetal assessment and maternal stabilization take precedence."

    "d": {
      "correct": false,
      "scoringWeight": 0,
      "content": "Applying a warm compress to the abdomen is inappropriate and potentially harmful. The abdominal pain is caused by uterine ischemia and irritation from the retroplacental hematoma. Applying heat can increase blood flow to the area, potentially worsening the hemorrhage. Furthermore, it delays critical interventions such as fetal monitoring and preparation for potential emergency cesarean section. This action provides no clinical benefit and could exacerbate the situation."

  "questionTrap": {
    "content": "The primary trap is differentiating abruptio placentae from placenta previa. Abruptio placentae typically presents with severe abdominal pain, a rigid/tender uterus, and dark red bleeding. Placenta previa usually presents with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding and a soft, non-tender uterus. Another trap is focusing on potential underlying causes (like preeclampsia) instead of managing the acute emergency, which requires immediate fetal and maternal assessment."
