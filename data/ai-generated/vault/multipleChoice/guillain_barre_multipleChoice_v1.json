            "content": "This is the correct priority assessment. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is characterized by an autoimmune-mediated demyelination of peripheral nerves. The classic presentation is an ascending symmetric paralysis. The most life-threatening complication occurs when this paralysis reaches the thoracic region, affecting the phrenic nerve (which innervates the diaphragm) and intercostal nerves. This leads to respiratory muscle weakness and eventual flaccid paralysis, causing acute ventilatory failure. Serial vital capacity (VC) is the most sensitive, non-invasive measure of respiratory muscle strength. A declining VC (e.g., <20 mL/kg) is a critical indicator of impending respiratory arrest and the need for intubation. Continuous pulse oximetry is also important but is a lagging indicator; significant hypercapnia and hypoventilation can occur before a drop in SpO2 is detected."

        "b": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This assessment is not the most critical. The pathophysiology of GBS involves destruction of the myelin sheath of lower motor neurons, which disrupts the reflex arc. This results in areflexia (absence of reflexes) or profound hyporeflexia, which is an expected clinical sign of the disease. While monitoring deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) helps track the progression of the paralysis, their absence is a hallmark feature, not an acute emergency. Performing this hourly does not provide more critical data than monitoring the patient's ability to breathe, which is the immediate threat to life."

        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This assessment is important but not the highest priority. GBS can involve the autonomic nervous system, leading to complications such as urinary retention (due to effects on the sacral autonomic nerves) or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Monitoring daily weight and urinary output is essential for managing fluid balance and detecting these autonomic dysfunctions. However, acute respiratory failure from ascending paralysis is a far more immediate and life-threatening complication than fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which typically develop more slowly."

        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This assessment is not the most critical at this moment. While cranial nerve involvement can occur in GBS (particularly in variants like Miller Fisher syndrome), the most common and dangerous progression is the ascending paralysis affecting respiratory function. Cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), and VI (abducens) control extraocular movements. Paralysis of these nerves (ophthalmoplegia) is not life-threatening. The nurse should be more concerned with cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus), which affect swallowing and gag reflex, as their impairment signals an increased risk of aspiration. However, even this is secondary to assessing direct respiratory muscle function via vital capacity."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "The Neurological Distraction",
        "content": "The primary trap is choosing a detailed neurological assessment (like DTRs or specific cranial nerves) over the immediate life-sustaining priority of respiratory function. The progression of weakness from the legs to the fingertips is a classic 'ascending' pattern. The critical thinking error is failing to extrapolate this pattern to its most dangerous conclusion: paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. GBS is a classic 'ABCs' (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) problem masquerading as a purely neurological one."
