    "a": {
      "content": "Correct. ARDS is triggered by a systemic inflammatory response (often sepsis), leading to the release of cytokines. These cytokines damage the alveolar-capillary membrane, increasing its permeability. This results in protein-rich fluid leaking into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema. The fluid dilutes and inactivates surfactant, leading to widespread alveolar collapse (atelectasis). This creates a significant intrapulmonary shunt, where deoxygenated blood bypasses ventilated alveoli. Consequently, the blood remains deoxygenated regardless of FiO2, resulting in refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg on FiO2 > 60%). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio will be less than 300.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "b": {
      "content": "Incorrect. COPD exacerbations cause hypoxemia primarily due to ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch from bronchospasm and mucus plugging. While severe, this hypoxemia usually responds to increased supplemental oxygen because some alveoli remain ventilated. The patient's profound hypoxemia unresponsive to 100% FiO2 indicates a shunt, not the V/Q mismatch typical of COPD.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "c": {
      "content": "Incorrect. A massive PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, creating alveolar dead space (ventilation without perfusion). This causes a V/Q mismatch and can lead to severe hypoxemia. However, PE-related hypoxemia often shows some improvement with 100% FiO2 as oxygen is shunted to perfused lung regions. The lack of response points to the profound intrapulmonary shunting of ARDS.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "d": {
      "content": "Incorrect. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from left ventricular failure, increasing hydrostatic pressure in pulmonary capillaries (PCWP > 18 mmHg), forcing fluid into the alveoli. While this causes hypoxemia, the patient's condition is septic shock, a distributive shock, not cardiac failure. ARDS involves inflammatory capillary leakage (non-cardiogenic edema), not high hydrostatic pressure.",

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Shunt vs. V/Q Mismatch",
    "content": "The critical trap is differentiating between causes of severe hypoxemia. Both PE and ARDS can cause sudden respiratory distress. The key is the *refractory* hypoxemia (PaO2 of 55 mmHg on 100% FiO2), indicating a large intrapulmonary shunt where blood bypasses ventilation. This is the hallmark of ARDS. Hypoxemia from a V/Q mismatch (PE or COPD) will typically improve with 100% FiO2, unlike shunt physiology."
