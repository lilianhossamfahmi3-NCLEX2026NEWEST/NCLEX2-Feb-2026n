    "a": {
      "content": "Correct. ARDS, often triggered by sepsis, causes a systemic inflammatory response and cytokine release. This damages the alveolar-capillary membrane, increasing permeability and leading to protein-rich fluid leakage into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema. Surfactant is diluted and inactivated, leading to alveolar collapse (atelectasis). This creates an intrapulmonary shunt, where deoxygenated blood bypasses ventilated alveoli. Consequently, blood remains deoxygenated regardless of FiO2, resulting in refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg on FiO2 > 60%). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio will be less than 300.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "b": {
      "content": "Incorrect. COPD exacerbations cause hypoxemia primarily due to ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch from bronchospasm and mucus plugging. While severe, this hypoxemia usually responds to increased supplemental oxygen because some alveoli remain ventilated. The patient's profound hypoxemia unresponsive to 100% FiO2 indicates a shunt, not the V/Q mismatch typical of COPD.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "c": {
      "content": "Incorrect. A massive PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, creating alveolar dead space (ventilation without perfusion). This causes a V/Q mismatch and can lead to severe hypoxemia. However, PE-related hypoxemia often shows some improvement with 100% FiO2 as oxygen is shunted to perfused lung regions. The lack of response points to the profound intrapulmonary shunting of ARDS.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "d": {
      "content": "Incorrect. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from left ventricular failure, increasing hydrostatic pressure in pulmonary capillaries (PCWP > 18 mmHg), forcing fluid into the alveoli. While this causes hypoxemia, the patient's condition is septic shock, a distributive shock, not cardiac failure. ARDS involves inflammatory capillary leakage (non-cardiogenic edema), not high hydrostatic pressure.",

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Shunt vs. V/Q Mismatch",
    "content": "The critical trap is differentiating between causes of severe hypoxemia. Both PE and ARDS can cause sudden respiratory distress. The key is the *refractory* hypoxemia (PaO2 of 55 mmHg on 100% FiO2), indicating a large intrapulmonary shunt where blood bypasses ventilation. This is the hallmark of ARDS. Hypoxemia from a V/Q mismatch (PE or COPD) will typically improve with 100% FiO2, unlike shunt physiology."

    "correct": "The patient's presentation of sudden respiratory distress and refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 of 55 mmHg despite 100% FiO2) in the context of septic shock strongly suggests ARDS. Sepsis is a common trigger for ARDS, leading to alveolar-capillary membrane damage and intrapulmonary shunting, which causes hypoxemia that is unresponsive to supplemental oxygen. The other options are less likely given the refractory nature of the hypoxemia and the patient's history of septic shock."
