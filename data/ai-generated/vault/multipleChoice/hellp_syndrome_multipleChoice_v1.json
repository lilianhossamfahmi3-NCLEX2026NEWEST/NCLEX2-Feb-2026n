The severe RUQ pain is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and stretching of Glisson's capsule, the fibrous sheath covering the liver. Preeclampsia-induced systemic endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm lead to microangiopathic hemolysis. This process causes fibrin deposition in the hepatic sinusoids, obstructing blood flow and leading to periportal necrosis. This cellular injury releases liver enzymes like AST into the bloodstream. The 'H' in HELLP (Hemolysis) is directly indicated by the elevated LDH, which is released from damaged red blood cells (RBCs) as they are sheared by fibrin strands in constricted microvasculature."

The patient's presenting symptom is severe RUQ pain, which directly correlates with liver involvement. The pathophysiology involves increased platelet activation, aggregation, and consumption at sites of endothelial damage throughout the microvasculature. However, elevated liver enzymes combined with a hemolysis marker (LDH) provides a more complete picture of the multi-systemic process defining HELLP, especially in relation to the patient's chief complaint."

The underlying pathophysiology is glomerular endotheliosis, where swollen endothelial cells in the kidney's glomeruli reduce renal blood flow and filtration rate. While this finding is concerning and reflects the severity of the preeclampsia, it is not a defining component of the HELLP syndrome acronym (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). HELLP specifically describes a unique pattern of hepatic and hematologic dysfunction."

This occurs due to widespread endothelial cell dysfunction characteristic of the disease. However, like elevated creatinine, proteinuria indicates the underlying preeclamptic process and its effect on the kidneys, but it is not part of the specific diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome. Some patients with HELLP may not even have significant proteinuria or hypertension, making the hematologic and hepatic labs the definitive markers."

    "questionTrap": "The trap is distinguishing between findings of severe preeclampsia and the specific criteria for HELLP syndrome. All distractors are signs of severe preeclampsia but do not define HELLP. Test-takers must recognize that RUQ pain points directly to hepatic involvement, making the liver enzyme and hemolysis markers (AST/LDH) the most specific answer. Simply choosing any abnormal lab associated with preeclampsia (like low platelets, high creatinine, or proteinuria) is insufficient.",
