The severe RUQ pain is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and stretching of Glisson's capsule. Preeclampsia-induced endothelial dysfunction leads to microangiopathic hemolysis, causing fibrin deposition in hepatic sinusoids, obstructing blood flow, and leading to periportal necrosis. This releases liver enzymes like AST. Elevated LDH indicates hemolysis, as it's released from damaged red blood cells sheared by fibrin strands."

She was admitted at 1000 for management of preeclampsia. Current vital signs are stable, but she reports worsening RUQ pain.\nAssessment: The patient's symptoms and lab results are being reviewed to assess for HELLP syndrome. Current lab results show AST 150 U/L, LDH 700 U/L, and platelets 95,000/mm³. The patient is also reporting nausea.\nRecommendation: Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, HELLP syndrome is suspected. Notify the physician immediately, prepare for potential interventions such as magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, and anticipate possible delivery. Further evaluation, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation studies, is needed urgently."
