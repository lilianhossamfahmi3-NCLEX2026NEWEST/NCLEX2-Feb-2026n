    "incorrect": "Increased heart rate and elevated white blood cell count are common findings in sepsis as the body attempts to compensate for decreased tissue perfusion and fight infection. While concerning, these findings are not specific to MODS. | Decreased systolic blood pressure can be a sign of septic shock but does not necessarily indicate multiple organs are failing. The patient's blood pressure is being supported with vasopressors. | Elevated temperature and increased respiratory rate are expected responses to infection and inflammation in sepsis. While they indicate an active infection, they do not directly reflect failure of multiple organ systems.",
