  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing supportive data with definitive diagnostic evidence. Both an elevated D-dimer and sinus tachycardia are expected findings with a PE, but they are non-specific, especially in a post-operative patient. The critical thinking error is failing to consider the patient's specific context: major orthopedic surgery. This context renders the D-dimer less reliable due to post-surgical inflammation and makes tachycardia a common finding for multiple reasons (pain, hypovolemia, PE). The definitive test must directly visualize the pathophysiology in question—the clot in the artery—which only the CTPA accomplishes.",
