While other findings support the diagnosis, CTPA provides the definitive confirmation required for treatment initiation.",

Sinus tachycardia is the most common ECG finding in PE but is non-specific. Chest X-rays are often normal in patients with PE or may show non-specific findings like atelectasis, which does not confirm the presence of a clot.",
