    "correct": "Cushing's triad is a late sign of increased ICP and indicates impending brain herniation. It consists of bradycardia (slow heart rate), irregular respirations (often bradypnea), and a widening pulse pressure (increased systolic with a stable or decreased diastolic). This reflects the brain's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of rising ICP by increasing systolic blood pressure and slowing the heart rate. This is a critical neurological emergency requiring immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea are signs of sympathetic nervous system activation, often seen with pain, anxiety, or early stages of increased ICP, but do not specifically define Cushing's triad. Hypotension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations can indicate shock or other cardiovascular issues, but not the specific compensatory mechanism of Cushing's triad related to ICP. Hypertension, tachycardia, and apnea are not consistent with Cushing's triad and suggest other underlying medical issues.",

He is now exhibiting signs of increased ICP. \n\n0705: Patient’s current GCS is 10. Vital signs are: HR 52, BP 190/80, irregular respirations at 10 breaths per minute. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil being slightly dilated and sluggish to respond to light. Previous vital signs at 0400 were HR 78, BP 140/90, respirations 16. \n\n0710: I am concerned about potential brain herniation. I have notified the neurosurgeon and am awaiting further orders. I have elevated the head of the bed to 30 degrees and am closely monitoring his neurological status. Please advise. Pain level is difficult to assess due to decreased level of consciousness.",
