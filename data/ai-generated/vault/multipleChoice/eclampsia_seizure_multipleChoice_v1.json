The correct sequence is: ensure safety/airway, then administer medication, then notify the provider for definitive treatment planning (delivery)."

                "content": "During a tonic-clonic seizure, protective airway reflexes are compromised. Turning the patient to the left lateral position utilizes gravity to drain saliva and potential vomitus away from the posterior pharynx, preventing aspiration pneumonitis. This position also helps prevent the tongue from occluding the airway. In a pregnant patient, the left lateral position specifically alleviates compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus (aortocaval compression), which is critical for maximizing venous return to the heart, optimizing cardiac output, and maintaining uteroplacental perfusion to prevent fetal hypoxia. Protecting the head and neck prevents traumatic injury from impact with hard surfaces."

                "content": "Inserting any object into the mouth of a seizing patient is contraindicated and dangerous. The masseter muscle can generate immense force during the tonic phase, leading to fractured teeth, which can then be aspirated. The object itself can cause severe lacerations to the oral mucosa, lips, and tongue. Furthermore, a broken tongue blade can become a foreign body, completely obstructing the airway. This action directly causes harm and does not protect the airway."

The seizure state involves massive catecholamine release, severe hypertension, and cerebral hypoxia. Subjecting the mother to general anesthesia and major surgery in this state would precipitate catastrophic hemodynamic collapse, stroke, or cardiac arrest. The priority is to first stabilize the mother by stopping the seizure, securing her airway, and managing her blood pressure. Only *after* maternal stabilization can fetal delivery be considered safely."

No recent changes in medication or condition reported prior to the seizure.\nAssessment: Patient is actively seizing. Airway patency is unknown. Fetal heart tones are being assessed. Maternal vital signs are unobtainable during the seizure.\nRecommendation: Immediately turn the patient to the left lateral position and protect her head and neck to prevent injury and aspiration. After seizure cessation, assess airway, breathing, and circulation. Administer oxygen as needed. Prepare for Magnesium Sulfate administration per protocol. Notify the provider immediately after initial stabilization."
