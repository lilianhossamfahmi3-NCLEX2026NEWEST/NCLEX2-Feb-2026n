            "content": "Magnesium Sulfate is the definitive anticonvulsant for eclampsia, acting as a CNS depressant by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and calcium channels, thus raising the seizure threshold. However, its administration is not the absolute first action during an active seizure. Securing the airway and preventing physical injury takes precedence over pharmacology. Attempting to establish IV access or administer medication while the patient is convulsing is difficult and diverts attention from the immediate life-threats of airway obstruction and aspiration, which can cause severe maternal and fetal hypoxia within seconds."
        },
        "b": {
            "content": "During a tonic-clonic seizure, protective airway reflexes are lost. Turning the patient to the left lateral position utilizes gravity to drain saliva and potential vomitus away from the posterior pharynx, preventing aspiration pneumonitis. This position also prevents the tongue from occluding the airway. In a pregnant patient, the left lateral position specifically alleviates compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus (aortocaval compression), which is critical for maximizing venous return to the heart, optimizing cardiac output, and maintaining uteroplacental perfusion to prevent fetal hypoxia. Protecting the head prevents traumatic brain injury from impact with hard surfaces."

        "c": {
            "content": "Inserting any object into the mouth of a seizing patient is contraindicated and dangerous. The masseter muscle can generate immense force during the tonic phase, leading to fractured teeth, which can then be aspirated. The object itself can cause severe lacerations to the oral mucosa, lips, and tongue. Furthermore, a broken tongue blade can become a foreign body, completely obstructing the airway. This action directly causes harm and does not protect the airway."
        },
        "d": {
            "content": "While delivery of the fetus and placenta is the ultimate cure for eclampsia, initiating an emergency C-section during an active seizure is contraindicated. The seizure state involves massive catecholamine release, severe hypertension, and cerebral hypoxia. Subjecting the mother to general anesthesia and major surgery in this state would precipitate catastrophic hemodynamic collapse, stroke, or cardiac arrest. The priority is to first stabilize the mother by stopping the seizure, securing her airway, and managing her blood pressure. Only after maternal stabilization can fetal delivery be considered safely."

    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is choosing the correct medication (Magnesium Sulfate) over the most immediate patient safety intervention. NCLEX questions focusing on active emergencies often test the nurse's ability to prioritize fundamental life-saving actions (Airway, Breathing, Safety) before administering medications or notifying the provider. The correct sequence is: ensure safety/airway, then administer medication, then notify the provider for definitive treatment planning (delivery).",
    "mnemonics": "Maternal Seizure Priority: 'SAFE' First. **S**ide-lying position (left lateral). **A**irway protection (nothing in mouth). **F**ree from injury (protect head, loosen clothing). **E**valuate post-seizure.
