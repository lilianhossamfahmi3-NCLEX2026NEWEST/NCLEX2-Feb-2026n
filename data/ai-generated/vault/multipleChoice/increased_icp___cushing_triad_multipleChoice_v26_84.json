The body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing systemic blood pressure. The widening pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic) is also significant. Increased ICP triggers the Cushing reflex, leading to this hypertensive response to maintain cerebral blood flow. clinicalPearl: Monitor trends in blood pressure; a progressively widening pulse pressure is a critical indicator. questionTrap: Students may focus solely on elevated BP without recognizing the significance of the widening pulse pressure. mnemonic: Think of 'Pressure' in ICP, leading to increased systolic pressure."

This is a reflex response to the elevated blood pressure, attempting to lower overall cardiac output. clinicalPearl: Be alert for a sudden drop in heart rate in patients with known or suspected head injuries. questionTrap: Students might attribute bradycardia to medication effects or other causes, overlooking its significance in the context of head trauma. mnemonic: 'Slow' heart rate in Cushing's Triad."

Unequal or nonreactive pupils are more indicative of ICP due to pressure on the oculomotor nerve (CN III). clinicalPearl: Assess pupillary response bilaterally and compare for any asymmetry. questionTrap: Students may assume that 'reactive' pupils always indicate stability, overlooking the importance of equality and size. mnemonic: 'Unequal' pupils suggest increased ICP."

While hyperthermia can sometimes occur due to hypothalamic dysfunction in severe cases of ICP, a normal temperature is not a component of Cushing's Triad. However, significant temperature changes (either hyper- or hypothermia) can indicate hypothalamic involvement. clinicalPearl: Monitor temperature trends closely, as both extremes can worsen neurological outcomes. questionTrap: Students may focus on fever as a sign of infection, overlooking its potential neurological origin in head trauma. mnemonic: Temperature changes are 'Variable' in ICP."

This value reflects adequate respiratory function but doesn't negate the possibility of neurological compromise. However, declining oxygen saturation in the context of head trauma should raise concern for respiratory depression secondary to increased ICP. clinicalPearl: Ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent secondary brain injury from hypoxia. questionTrap: Students may be reassured by a 'normal' SpO2 reading, overlooking the potential for rapid deterioration. mnemonic: 'Oxygenation' is important, but not a direct indicator of Cushing's Triad."
