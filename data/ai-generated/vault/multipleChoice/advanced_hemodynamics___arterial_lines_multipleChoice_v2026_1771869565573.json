            "background": "Mr. Johnson's history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He has been afebrile since ICU admission. Pre-operative BP was around 140/80 mmHg. Pre-op labs were within normal limits. He received morphine 2mg IV for pain at 06:00.",
            "assessment": "The arterial line waveform is dampened, showing a BP of 90/60 mmHg (MAP 70 mmHg). Simultaneously, the NIBP reads 120/80 mmHg (MAP 93 mmHg). The patient is alert and oriented but reports feeling lightheaded. His heart rate is 98 bpm and regular; respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min, unlabored; SpO2 is 98% on 2L nasal cannula. Urine output has been 30 mL/hr for the last 2 hours.",
            "recommendation": "I recommend a thorough assessment of the arterial line for mechanical issues like kinks, air bubbles, or clots, given the discrepancy between arterial line and NIBP readings and the dampened waveform. The arterial line reading may be inaccurate. Depending on findings, recalibration or alternative BP monitoring methods may be needed. Consider a fluid bolus if the arterial line is accurate and lightheadedness persists."
