Kinks in the tubing, air bubbles, or small clots at the catheter tip can obstruct the pressure transmission, leading to a falsely low or dampened reading.

Zeroing addresses baseline accuracy, but it won't resolve mechanical obstructions like kinks or clots. These must be addressed first. If the waveform remains dampened after troubleshooting the mechanical aspects, then zeroing and calibration should be performed."

      "situation": "Patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU following a CABG yesterday at 1400. He has an arterial line in his right radial artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring. He is currently on a norepinephrine drip at 5 mcg/min to maintain a MAP above 65 mmHg.",
      "background": "Patient's past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He has been afebrile since arrival to ICU. His baseline blood pressure prior to surgery was approximately 140/80 mmHg. Pre-op labs were within normal limits.",
      "assessment": "At 0700, the arterial line waveform appears dampened. Blood pressure reading from the arterial line is 90/60 mmHg (MAP 70 mmHg). Simultaneously, the NIBP reading is 120/80 mmHg (MAP 93 mmHg). The patient is alert and oriented, but states he feels slightly lightheaded. Heart rate is 98 bpm and regular. Respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min and unlabored. Oxygen saturation is 98% on 2L nasal cannula.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend we first assess the arterial line for any mechanical issues such as kinks, air bubbles, or clots. Given the discrepancy between the arterial line and NIBP readings, and the dampened waveform, the arterial line reading may not be accurate. Depending on the findings, further interventions may be needed, such as recalibrating the transducer or considering alternative methods for blood pressure monitoring."
