            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is the correct answer. The patient's presentation is a classic triad for Serotonin Syndrome: autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, diaphoresis), neuromuscular excitation (hyperreflexia, clonus), and altered mental status (agitation). Sertraline is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). St. John's Wort, an herbal supplement, also has serotonergic properties, including inhibiting serotonin reuptake and acting as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The combination of these two agents creates a synergistic and dangerous accumulation of serotonin in the central nervous system synapses. This excessive stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors directly causes the observed clinical manifestations."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine with strong anticholinergic properties. While it can cause altered mental status (confusion, sedation), its mechanism of action does not increase synaptic serotonin levels. In fact, an anticholinergic toxidrome would present differently, with symptoms like mydriasis, flushed skin, dry mucous membranes, and urinary retention, rather than the specific neuromuscular hyperexcitability (clonus, hyperreflexia) and diaphoresis seen in Serotonin Syndrome."

        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic whose primary mechanism involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily within the central nervous system. Its metabolic and pharmacodynamic pathways do not interact with serotonin synthesis, release, or reuptake. Therefore, it does not contribute to the risk of Serotonin Syndrome and is considered safe to administer with SSRIs like Sertraline."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used to lower cholesterol. Its mechanism of action is confined to the lipid synthesis pathway in the liver and has no known pharmacodynamic effect on serotonin or other neurotransmitter systems in the brain. There is no established interaction between statins and SSRIs that would precipitate Serotonin Syndrome."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "The Herbal Supplement Blind Spot",
        "explanation": "The primary trap in this question is underestimating the pharmacological potency of herbal supplements. Patients often perceive supplements like St. John's Wort as 'natural' and therefore harmless, failing to report them during medication reconciliation. Elite nursing practice requires specific and direct questioning about all over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and herbal products to prevent life-threatening interactions like Serotonin Syndrome."
