Sertraline, an SSRI, increases serotonin levels. St. John's Wort also has serotonergic properties, inhibiting serotonin reuptake and acting as a weak MAOI. The combination of these two substances can lead to excessive serotonin accumulation in the CNS, resulting in overstimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.",

While it can cause altered mental status (confusion, sedation), it does not directly increase synaptic serotonin levels.
