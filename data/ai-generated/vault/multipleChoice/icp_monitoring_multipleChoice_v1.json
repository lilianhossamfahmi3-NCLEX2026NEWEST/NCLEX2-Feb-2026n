    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. The tragus of the ear (external auditory meatus) approximates the level of the Foramen of Monro, an interventricular channel connecting the lateral and third ventricles, which is the reference point for accurate ICP measurement. Leveling the transducer to this landmark ensures the zero-reference point aligns with the hydrostatic level of the CSF, providing a reading that accurately reflects intracranial pressure. Accurate ICP readings are essential for calculating Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP) and guiding treatment decisions."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. The phlebostatic axis (4th intercostal space, mid-axillary line) is the reference point for central venous pressure (CVP) and arterial blood pressure monitoring, not ICP monitoring. Leveling the EVD transducer to this point would result in a falsely elevated ICP reading due to hydrostatic pressure, potentially leading to inappropriate and harmful interventions."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. The xiphoid process is an anatomical landmark at the inferior end of the sternum and is not a reference point for ICP monitoring. Leveling the EVD transducer to this point would result in a significantly elevated and inaccurate ICP reading, leading to potentially dangerous clinical decisions based on erroneous data."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. The angle of Louis (sternal angle) is located at the 2nd intercostal space and is a landmark for cardiac auscultation. While superior to the phlebostatic axis, it is still inferior to the Foramen of Monro. Using this landmark for EVD leveling would result in a falsely elevated ICP reading, leading to potential mismanagement of cerebral hypertension."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Landmark Confusion",
    "explanation": "This question tests the nurse's understanding of the correct anatomical landmark for leveling an EVD transducer. The trap lies in confusing the landmarks used for different types of pressure monitoring (e.g., CVP vs. ICP). Incorrectly applying the phlebostatic axis, commonly used for CVP monitoring, to ICP monitoring can lead to a falsely elevated ICP reading and inappropriate treatment."
