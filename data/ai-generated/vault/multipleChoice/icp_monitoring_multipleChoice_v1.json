The ICP is trending upwards. \nBackground: The patient was admitted following a motor vehicle accident. His initial GCS was 6. He is currently intubated and sedated. An EVD was placed to monitor ICP and drain CSF as needed. \nAssessment: The current ICP reading is trending upwards. Before escalating treatment, I am verifying the accuracy of the reading by checking the leveling of the EVD transducer. The patient's current MAP is 85 mmHg. CSF drainage has been minimal over the last hour. \nRecommendation: Please confirm that the EVD transducer is leveled to the tragus of the ear (external auditory meatus). If not, please re-level and reassess the ICP reading. I will notify you of the updated ICP reading after re-leveling. Time: 14:00."
