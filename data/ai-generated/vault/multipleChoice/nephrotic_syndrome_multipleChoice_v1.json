It results from significant inflammatory damage to the glomerular capillary walls, allowing red blood cells to leak into the renal tubules. In nephrotic syndrome, the primary pathology is podocyte damage, which increases permeability to proteins, not typically red blood cells."

The underlying pathophysiology involves damage to the glomerular podocytes, which effaces their foot processes and disrupts the slit diaphragm. This dramatically increases the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier to large molecules, primarily albumin, leading to its excretion in the urine. This protein loss drives the hypoalbuminemia and subsequent edema seen in the client."

These casts are formed when WBCs aggregate within the tubular lumen. Nephrotic syndrome is an immune-mediated glomerular disease, not a bacterial infection of the kidney parenchyma."

            "content": "A specific gravity of 1.005 signifies dilute urine. In nephrotic syndrome, massive protein loss into the urine leads to severe hypoalbuminemia and a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure. This causes a fluid shift from the intravascular to the interstitial space, leading to intravascular volume depletion. This hypovolemia activates the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and ADH secretion, causing the kidneys to conserve sodium and water, resulting in concentrated urine with a high specific gravity (e.g., >1.020)."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the clinical presentation of nephrotic syndrome with nephritic syndrome (e.g., acute glomerulonephritis). While both involve the glomerulus and can cause edema, the key differentiator is the primary urinary finding. NephrOtic syndrome is characterized by massive prOteinuria. NephrItic syndrome is characterized by Inflammatory damage leading to hematuria. Remember 'O' for prOtein in nephrOtic.",
