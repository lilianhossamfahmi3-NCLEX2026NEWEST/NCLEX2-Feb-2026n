      "optionId": "a",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "This action is absolutely contraindicated. In placenta previa, the placenta abnormally implants over or near the cervical os. A digital vaginal exam can disrupt the placenta, potentially causing placental separation from the uterine wall and rupturing the low-pressure maternal venous sinuses. This can trigger massive, uncontrollable hemorrhage, leading to rapid maternal hypovolemic shock and profound fetal hypoxia or death. The low-lying placenta lacks the structural support of the uterine wall, making it vulnerable to disruption. ClinicalPearl: Never perform a vaginal exam on a patient with painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester until placenta previa is ruled out by ultrasound.",
      "rationale": "Performing a digital vaginal examination in the presence of placenta previa can directly traumatize the placental tissue. The disruption of the placental vessels leads to significant maternal hemorrhage and fetal compromise due to decreased oxygen and nutrient exchange. This is a direct violation of the 'do no harm' principle."

      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is a critical priority action. Vaginal bleeding, even if painless, indicates potential placental separation, which compromises the surface area for maternal-fetal gas exchange. Continuous fetal monitoring is essential to assess for signs of fetal distress (e.g., late decelerations, decreased variability, bradycardia) that signal uteroplacental insufficiency and impending fetal compromise, necessitating immediate intervention. ClinicalPearl: Fetal heart rate monitoring provides crucial information about the fetus's oxygenation status and guides decisions regarding delivery.",
      "rationale": "Continuous fetal monitoring allows for the early detection of fetal distress, such as late decelerations or decreased variability, which are indicative of uteroplacental insufficiency. Early detection allows for timely interventions to improve fetal outcomes."

      "optionId": "c",
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is a necessary preparatory action. The primary risk in placenta previa is life-threatening hemorrhage. A Type and Crossmatch prepares for emergency blood transfusion by identifying the patient's blood type (ABO/Rh) and matching it with compatible units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). This ensures that blood products are immediately available to restore oxygen-carrying capacity and circulating volume if severe bleeding occurs. ClinicalPearl: Anticipating the need for blood transfusion is crucial in managing placenta previa.",
      "rationale": "A Type and Crossmatch is essential to prepare for potential blood transfusions in the event of significant hemorrhage. This ensures that compatible blood products are readily available to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity and prevent hypovolemic shock."

      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is a crucial emergent action. Establishing large-bore (16- or 18-gauge) intravenous access is vital for rapid volume resuscitation. According to Poiseuille's law, flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, so a large catheter allows for the rapid infusion of crystalloid solutions and blood products necessary to counteract hypotension and prevent cardiovascular collapse from acute hemorrhage. ClinicalPearl: Rapid volume resuscitation is critical to stabilize the patient and prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
      "rationale": "Large-bore IV access allows for the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and blood products to maintain adequate circulating volume and blood pressure. This is crucial to prevent hypovolemic shock and ensure adequate perfusion to vital organs."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is mistaking this presentation for a normal labor check. In nearly any other obstetric scenario with bleeding, a cervical exam is standard. However, the combination of third-trimester bleeding and the absence of pain is the classic hallmark of placenta previa, making a digital exam the one action that can cause a catastrophic outcome. The other options are all correct, urgent interventions, designed to distract from the single absolute contraindication.",
