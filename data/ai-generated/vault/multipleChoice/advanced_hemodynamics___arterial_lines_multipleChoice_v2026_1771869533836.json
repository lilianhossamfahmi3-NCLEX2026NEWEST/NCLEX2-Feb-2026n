        "stem": "A patient in the ICU with septic shock has an arterial line in place. The nurse notes the following:\n\n**SBAR Report:**\n**Situation:** Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old male admitted at 06:00 for septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n**Background:** He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics at 06:30, 24 hours ago. He is currently receiving norepinephrine at 10 mcg/min to maintain a MAP >65 mmHg. Urine output has been low (15-20 mL/hr) for the past 4 hours despite a 500 mL bolus of crystalloid administered at 05:00.\n**Assessment:** Vitals at 07:00: BP 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63 mmHg), HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 4L nasal cannula. Arterial line waveform shows a dampened tracing. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg. Labs from 06:00: Lactate 4.0 mmol/L, WBC 18,000/uL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL. Physical exam reveals cool, clammy extremities with weak peripheral pulses. Chest auscultation is clear bilaterally.\n**Recommendation:** I am concerned about persistent hypotension and decreased urine output despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. I recommend reassessing fluid responsiveness, considering additional vasopressors, and evaluating for other causes of hypotension. Please evaluate and advise.\n\nBased on the provided information, which intervention is the MOST appropriate for the nurse to implement *FIRST*?",

A more targeted approach is needed initially. The patient's CVP is already low, but further boluses should be guided by assessing for fluid responsiveness (e.g., passive leg raise, stroke volume variation)."

                "rationale": "Given the patient's persistent hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg) despite the current norepinephrine dose, increasing the vasopressor infusion rate is the most appropriate first step. This will help increase vascular tone and improve blood pressure. The dampened arterial line waveform suggests potential issues with the line itself, but addressing the critical hypotension takes precedence. Ensure line patency is assessed promptly after addressing MAP. Norepinephrine acts primarily on alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure."

Addressing the hypotension with vasopressors takes priority. The arterial line issue should be addressed concurrently, but after the blood pressure is stabilized. A dampened waveform can lead to falsely low readings, but the patient's clinical presentation supports true hypotension."

It will further decrease intravascular volume and worsen hypotension. The priority is to improve blood pressure and perfusion, not to force diuresis. Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased water excretion, which would worsen hypovolemia."

        "rationales": "The patient presents with septic shock, evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate, and elevated WBC. The priority is to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Increasing the norepinephrine infusion rate is the most appropriate initial intervention to address the persistent hypotension. While other interventions, such as fluid resuscitation and addressing the arterial line waveform, are important, they are not the immediate priority. Furosemide would be detrimental in this scenario. The dampened arterial line waveform may be contributing to inaccurate readings, but addressing the blood pressure is paramount. The low CVP suggests hypovolemia, but further fluid boluses must be carefully considered in light of the potential for fluid overload and the lack of improvement in urine output. Increasing the vasopressor will help to increase the MAP and improve perfusion to the kidneys, which may improve urine output. Septic shock is characterized by vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance, leading to hypotension. Vasopressors like norepinephrine counteract this by causing vasoconstriction.",

        "questionTrap": "Many students will be tempted to choose recalibrating the arterial line (Option C) or administering more fluids (Option A) because of the dampened waveform and low CVP, respectively. However, the most crucial immediate intervention is to address the critical hypotension with a vasopressor (Option B). Failing to recognize the priority of addressing blood pressure in septic shock is the trap. The low CVP may indicate hypovolemia, but blindly administering fluids without assessing fluid responsiveness can be harmful.",
