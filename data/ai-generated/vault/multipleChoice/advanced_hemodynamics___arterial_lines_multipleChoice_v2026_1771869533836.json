    "stem": "A patient in the ICU with septic shock has an arterial line in place. The nurse notes the following:\n\n**SBAR Report:**\n**Situation:** Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old male admitted for septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n**Background:** He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics 24 hours ago. He is currently receiving norepinephrine at 10 mcg/min to maintain a MAP >65 mmHg. Urine output has been low (15-20 mL/hr) for the past 4 hours despite a 500 mL bolus of crystalloid administered 2 hours ago.\n**Assessment:** Vitals at 0700: BP 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63 mmHg), HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 4L nasal cannula. Arterial line waveform shows a dampened tracing. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg. Labs from 0600: Lactate 4.0 mmol/L, WBC 18,000/uL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL. Physical exam reveals cool, clammy extremities with weak peripheral pulses. Chest auscultation is clear bilaterally.\n**Recommendation:** I am concerned about persistent hypotension and decreased urine output despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. I recommend reassessing fluid responsiveness, considering additional vasopressors, and evaluating for other causes of hypotension. Please evaluate and advise.\n\nBased on the provided information, which intervention is the MOST appropriate for the nurse to implement *FIRST*?",

This will help increase vascular tone and improve blood pressure. The dampened arterial line waveform suggests potential issues with the line itself, but addressing the critical hypotension takes precedence. Ensure line patency is assessed promptly after addressing MAP."

        "rationale": "While a dampened arterial line waveform needs to be addressed, recalibrating the transducer alone will not immediately improve the patient's blood pressure. Addressing the hypotension with vasopressors takes priority. The arterial line issue should be addressed concurrently, but after the blood pressure is stabilized."

    ],
    "rationales": "The patient presents with septic shock, evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate, and elevated WBC. The priority is to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Increasing the norepinephrine infusion rate is the most appropriate initial intervention to address the persistent hypotension. While other interventions, such as fluid resuscitation and addressing the arterial line waveform, are important, they are not the immediate priority. Furosemide would be detrimental in this scenario. The dampened arterial line waveform may be contributing to inaccurate readings, but addressing the blood pressure is paramount. The low CVP suggests hypovolemia, but further fluid boluses must be carefully considered in light of the potential for fluid overload and the lack of improvement in urine output. Increasing the vasopressor will help to increase the MAP and improve perfusion to the kidneys, which may improve urine output.",

    "questionTrap": "Many students will be tempted to choose recalibrating the arterial line (Option C) or administering more fluids (Option A) because of the dampened waveform and low CVP, respectively. However, the most crucial immediate intervention is to address the critical hypotension with a vasopressor (Option B). Failing to recognize the priority of addressing blood pressure in septic shock is the trap.",
