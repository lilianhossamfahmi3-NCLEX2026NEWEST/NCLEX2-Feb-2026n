    "correct": "Muscle twitching and a positive Chvostek's sign are indicative of hypocalcemia, a severe complication of acute pancreatitis. The release of lipase during pancreatitis leads to fat necrosis and the formation of fatty acids. These fatty acids bind to calcium, leading to saponification and a decrease in serum calcium levels. Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular excitability, leading to tetany, seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias. This is a priority finding because it can rapidly progress to life-threatening complications such as laryngospasm and cardiac arrest. Immediate intervention is required to prevent these potentially fatal outcomes."
