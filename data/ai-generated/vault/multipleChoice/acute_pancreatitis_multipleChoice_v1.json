The release of lipase during pancreatitis leads to fat necrosis and the formation of fatty acids. These fatty acids bind to calcium, leading to saponification and a decrease in serum calcium levels. Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular excitability, leading to tetany, seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias. This is a priority finding because it can rapidly progress to life-threatening complications such as laryngospasm and cardiac arrest. Immediate intervention is required to prevent these potentially fatal outcomes.",

Orders: pain management, NPO, IV fluids. Initial amylase and lipase elevated.\nAssessment: Muscle twitching and positive Chvostek's sign, indicating possible hypocalcemia. Vital signs stable, but increasing anxiety.\nRecommendation: Notify provider. Recommend stat serum calcium level. Anticipate calcium gluconate/chloride, cardiac monitoring, seizure precautions. Monitor airway. Assess pain and administer medication."
