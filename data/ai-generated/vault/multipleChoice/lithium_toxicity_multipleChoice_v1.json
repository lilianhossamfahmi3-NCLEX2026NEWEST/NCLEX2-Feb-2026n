    "a": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "**Incorrect.** Administering more lithium is contraindicated and potentially life-threatening. A lithium level of 2.2 mEq/L indicates significant toxicity (therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Further increasing the lithium level can lead to severe neurotoxicity (seizures, coma, irreversible neurological damage - SILENT), cardiotoxicity (dysrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse), and death. The priority is to reduce the lithium level, not increase it. **+/- Scoring: -**"
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "**Correct.** This is the priority intervention. Lithium is a monovalent cation (Li+) handled by the kidneys similarly to sodium (Na+). Vomiting causes volume depletion and sodium loss, prompting the kidneys to reabsorb both sodium and lithium, worsening the toxicity. Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) corrects hypovolemia and provides sodium, which competes with lithium for reabsorption, promoting lithium excretion and lowering the toxic serum level. This addresses the underlying cause of the toxicity. **+/- Scoring: +**"

    "c": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "**Incorrect.** While an ECG is important for monitoring potential cardiotoxic effects of lithium (T-wave flattening, QT prolongation, bradycardia), it is not the *first* intervention. The priority is to address the elevated lithium level causing the cardiotoxicity. Delaying IV fluids to perform an ECG allows the lithium level to remain high or increase, exacerbating the risk of dysrhythmias. Address the cause before monitoring the effect. **+/- Scoring: -**"
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "**Incorrect.** This is a dangerous and contraindicated action. Lithium toxicity lowers the seizure threshold by disrupting neuronal membrane excitability. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, also lowers the seizure threshold. Concurrent administration creates a synergistic effect, dramatically increasing the risk of seizures. Furthermore, the combination of lithium and antipsychotics increases the risk of severe neurotoxicity and encephalopathy. **+/- Scoring: -**"

  "pathophysiology": "Lithium toxicity arises from its narrow therapeutic index and its interaction with sodium and water balance in the kidneys. Lithium, a monovalent cation, is primarily cleared renally, with approximately 80% reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, competing with sodium reabsorption. Conditions causing sodium and water depletion (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, thiazide diuretics) trigger increased proximal tubule reabsorption of both sodium and lithium to preserve intravascular volume. This elevates serum lithium levels, leading to toxicity. At toxic concentrations, lithium interferes with intracellular signaling pathways and disrupts neuronal membrane potentials by competing with essential cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+). This cellular disruption manifests as neurotoxicity (tremors, ataxia, confusion, seizures) and cardiotoxicity (dysrhythmias). Chronic toxicity can also lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to lithium's interference with ADH signaling in the collecting ducts.",
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is choosing a monitoring action (ECG) over the priority therapeutic intervention (IV fluids). While cardiotoxicity is a concern, the underlying cause is the elevated lithium level. The NCLEX prioritizes addressing the root cause, which in this case is enhancing renal clearance of lithium via intravenous fluid resuscitation. Fixing the cause is prioritized over monitoring the effect.",

  "clinicalPearl": "Always consider lithium toxicity in patients presenting with altered mental status, gastrointestinal distress, or neurological symptoms, especially if they have a history of bipolar disorder and are taking lithium. Early recognition and intervention with IV fluids can prevent severe complications. Remember to check lithium levels regularly and educate patients about the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding medications that can interact with lithium.",

    "situation": "Patient with bipolar disorder taking lithium presenting with signs of lithium toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tremors, ataxia) and a lithium level of 2.2 mEq/L.",
    "background": "Patient has been on lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder. Current symptoms suggest lithium toxicity, likely due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. Last lithium level was within therapeutic range one month ago. Patient reports decreased fluid intake over the past 3 days due to a mild upper respiratory infection.",
    "assessment": "Patient exhibits severe nausea, persistent vomiting, coarse hand tremors, and ataxia. Serum lithium level is 2.2 mEq/L at 14:30, indicating toxicity. Vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 97% on room air. ECG pending. Patient is alert but disoriented.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate 0.9% Normal Saline at 150 mL/hr IV to promote lithium excretion. Monitor vital signs, ECG, serum lithium levels, and neurological status closely. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urine electrolytes. Consider contacting nephrology for further management if lithium levels do not decrease with fluid resuscitation or if renal function deteriorates."
