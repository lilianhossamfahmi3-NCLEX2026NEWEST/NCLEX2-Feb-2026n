Administering more lithium would elevate serum levels further, accelerating the progression toward severe toxicity, which can manifest as seizures, coma, irreversible neurologic damage (Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity - SILENT), and cardiovascular collapse."

        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is the priority intervention. Lithium is a monovalent cation (Li+) that is handled by the proximal renal tubules similarly to sodium (Na+). The patient's vomiting has caused volume depletion and sodium loss. In response, the kidneys increase the reabsorption of both sodium and lithium to conserve volume. This renal response creates a vicious cycle, worsening the toxicity. Initiating an isotonic saline infusion (0.9% NaCl) directly corrects the hypovolemia and provides sodium, which competes with lithium for reabsorption, thereby promoting urinary excretion of lithium and lowering the toxic serum level."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "While essential for monitoring, this is not the first intervention. Lithium toxicity can cause cardiotoxic effects, such as T-wave flattening, QT prolongation, and bradycardia, by interfering with cardiac myocyte ion channels. However, obtaining an ECG is a diagnostic or monitoring action. The immediate priority is to implement the therapeutic intervention that addresses the root cause of the cardiotoxicity—the elevated lithium level. Delaying IV fluid administration to perform an ECG allows the serum lithium level to remain high or even increase, exacerbating the risk of a dysrhythmia."

        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is a dangerous and contraindicated action. Lithium toxicity profoundly lowers the seizure threshold by disrupting neuronal membrane excitability. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, also independently lowers the seizure threshold. Administering both agents concurrently in a toxic state creates a synergistic effect, dramatically increasing the risk of seizures. Furthermore, the combination of lithium and antipsychotics is associated with an increased risk of severe neurotoxicity and encephalopathy."
        }
    },
    "pathophysiology": "Lithium is a monovalent cation primarily cleared by the kidneys. Approximately 80% of filtered lithium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, a process that directly competes with sodium reabsorption. Conditions causing sodium and water depletion (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, thiazide diuretic use) trigger the kidneys to increase proximal tubule reabsorption of both sodium and lithium to preserve intravascular volume. This physiological response inadvertently raises serum lithium levels, precipitating toxicity. At toxic concentrations, lithium ions interfere with critical intracellular signaling pathways and disrupt neuronal membrane potentials by competing with other essential cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+). This widespread cellular disruption manifests clinically as neurotoxicity (tremors, ataxia, confusion, seizures) and cardiotoxicity (dysrhythmias).",
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap in this question is choosing a critical monitoring action (obtaining an ECG) over the priority therapeutic intervention. While cardiotoxicity is a major concern with lithium, the underlying cause is the elevated drug level. The NCLEX requires the nurse to first implement the action that will resolve the core problem, which in this case is enhancing the renal clearance of lithium via intravenous fluid resuscitation. Fixing the cause is prioritized over monitoring the effect.",
