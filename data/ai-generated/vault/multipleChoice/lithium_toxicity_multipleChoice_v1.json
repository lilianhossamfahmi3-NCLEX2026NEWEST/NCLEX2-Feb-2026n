    "pathophysiology": "Lithium toxicity arises from its narrow therapeutic index and its interaction with sodium and water balance in the kidneys. Lithium is primarily cleared renally, with approximately 80% reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, competing with sodium reabsorption. Conditions causing sodium and water depletion trigger increased proximal tubule reabsorption of both sodium and lithium to preserve intravascular volume. This elevates serum lithium levels, leading to toxicity. At toxic concentrations, lithium interferes with intracellular signaling pathways and disrupts neuronal membrane potentials. This cellular disruption manifests as neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Chronic toxicity can also lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to lithium's interference with ADH signaling in the collecting ducts.",

Remember to check lithium levels regularly and educate patients about the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding medications that can interact with lithium."

While cardiotoxicity is a concern, the underlying cause is the elevated lithium level. The NCLEX prioritizes addressing the root cause, which in this case is enhancing renal clearance of lithium via intravenous fluid resuscitation."

        "sbar": "Situation: Patient with bipolar disorder taking lithium presenting with signs of lithium toxicity and a lithium level of 2.2 mEq/L.\nBackground: Patient has been on lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder. Current symptoms suggest lithium toxicity, likely due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. Last lithium level was within therapeutic range one month ago. Patient reports decreased fluid intake over the past 3 days.\nAssessment: Patient exhibits severe nausea, persistent vomiting, coarse hand tremors, and ataxia. Serum lithium level is 2.2 mEq/L. Vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 97% on room air. ECG pending. Patient is alert but disoriented.\nRecommendation: Initiate 0.9% Normal Saline at 150 mL/hr IV to promote lithium excretion. Monitor vital signs, ECG, serum lithium levels, and neurological status closely. Obtain a CBC, CMP, and urine electrolytes. Consider contacting nephrology for further management if lithium levels do not decrease with fluid resuscitation or if renal function deteriorates."
