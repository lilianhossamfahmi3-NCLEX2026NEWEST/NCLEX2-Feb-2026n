        "correct": "Adenosine has an extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds). Therefore, it must be administered as a 'slam' (rapid IV bolus) through an IV port closest to the heart (preferable antecubital or central), followed immediately by a rapid saline flush to push the medication into the central circulation before it is metabolized in the bloodstream. If given slowly, the medication will be inactivated before it reaches the heart, resulting in treatment failure.",
        "incorrect": "Slow IV push and dilution are contraindicated and will make the drug ineffective. Carotid massage is a vagal maneuver that may be tried *before* medication but is not a 'technique for delivery' of adenosine.",
