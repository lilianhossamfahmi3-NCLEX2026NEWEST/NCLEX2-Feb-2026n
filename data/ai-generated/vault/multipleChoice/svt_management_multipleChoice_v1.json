                "content": "Correct. Due to adenosine's extremely short half-life, a rapid IV bolus (over 1-2 seconds) ensures a high-concentration wave reaches the heart. The immediate 20 mL saline flush acts as a fluid bolus, propelling the medication from the peripheral vein into the central circulation before significant peripheral metabolism occurs, optimizing drug delivery to the AV node for therapeutic effect."

                "content": "Incorrect. Diluting adenosine and administering it via an infusion pump is contraindicated. This delivers the drug at a slow, continuous rate, which is ineffective due to the drug's rapid metabolism. Insufficient medication would reach the coronary circulation and cardiac conduction system."

                "optionId": "d",
                "content": "Incorrect. Carotid sinus massage is a vagal maneuver used to slow AV conduction and is a separate therapeutic intervention for stable SVT, not a medication administration technique. It should be considered *before* pharmacologic intervention. Combining it with the injection or performing it for 60 seconds is inappropriate and increases the risk of profound bradycardia or asystole."
            }
        ],
        "pathophysiology": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is often caused by a re-entrant circuit involving the atrioventricular (AV) node. Adenosine terminates this dysrhythmia by binding to A1 purinergic receptors on AV nodal cells. This activates G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, leading to potassium efflux and hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. Hyperpolarization makes depolarization more difficult, transiently slowing AV nodal conduction and causing a temporary complete AV block. This interrupts the re-entrant circuit, allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to regain control. Adenosine's half-life is less than 10 seconds due to rapid uptake and degradation by red blood cells. Therefore, only a rapid, high-concentration bolus followed by a saline flush can deliver a sufficient quantity of the drug to the AV node before systemic clearance.",
        "questionTrap": "The primary trap is misapplying standard IV push safety protocols. Nurses are trained to administer potent cardiac medications slowly to prevent sudden hypotension or bradycardia. Adenosine is a critical exception. Applying the 'go slow' heuristic leads to therapeutic failure. The question forces differentiation between general medication safety and the unique requirements dictated by adenosine's ultra-short half-life.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Always have resuscitation equipment readily available when administering adenosine due to the risk of transient asystole or bradycardia. Explain to the patient that they may experience chest pressure, flushing, or shortness of breath during administration. Use a large bore IV site close to the heart (e.g., antecubital) for optimal delivery. Document the patient's response to the medication, including rhythm conversion and any adverse effects.",
        "mnemonics": "Adenosine Administration: 'SLAM & FLUSH!' Think of getting a message to the heart before it self-destructs in 10 seconds. You have to 'slam' it in and 'flush' it forward with saline to ensure it arrives on time. Another mnemonic: 'Adeno-GONE!' because it's in and gone so fast. Push it hard, or the rhythm stays on.",
        "correct": "The correct technique for administering adenosine is a rapid IV bolus followed immediately by a 20 mL saline flush. This ensures the medication reaches the heart quickly before it is metabolized."
