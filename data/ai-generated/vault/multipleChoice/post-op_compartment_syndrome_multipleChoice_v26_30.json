The ORIF was performed due to a fall resulting in a closed tibial fracture. He has been on standard post-operative care, including pain management and wound care. **Assessment:** At 08:00, the client reports a pain level of 8/10 in his right lower leg, despite receiving oxycodone at 07:00. The affected extremity is edematous and feels tight to the touch. Distal pulses are present but weak. Capillary refill is approximately 4 seconds. The client is also complaining of numbness and tingling in his toes. At 08:15, passive dorsiflexion of the foot elicits severe pain in the calf. **Recommendation:** I am concerned about potential compartment syndrome and recommend immediate assessment by the orthopedic surgeon and possible intervention.",

        "rationale": "Compartment syndrome is a condition in which increased pressure within a limited space compromises the circulation and function of the tissues within that space. In this case, the increased pressure in the lower leg, likely due to edema following the ORIF, is compressing the nerves and blood vessels. The classic '5 Ps' of compartment syndrome are Pain (out of proportion), Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, and Paralysis. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage, potentially leading to Volkmann's contracture or amputation.",
        "correctCount": 4,
        "clinicalPearls": "Early recognition of compartment syndrome is critical. The '5 Ps' are helpful, but pain out of proportion and paresthesia are usually the earliest signs. Do not wait for pulselessness; it is a late and ominous sign. If compartment syndrome is suspected, the surgeon should be notified immediately, and compartment pressure measurements should be taken. Fasciotomy is the definitive treatment to relieve the pressure.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students will focus on the vital signs or lab values being 'off,' but the key to this question is identifying the classic signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. The fact that the pain is unrelieved by pain medication should immediately raise suspicion. Also, relying solely on the presence or absence of a pulse can be misleading, as pulses can still be present in the early stages.",
        "mnemonic": "The 6 P's of Compartment Syndrome: Pain (out of proportion), Pressure, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pulselessness. Remember that pain and paresthesia are typically the earliest signs."
