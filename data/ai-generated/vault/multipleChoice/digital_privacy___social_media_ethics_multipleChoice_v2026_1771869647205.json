        "situation": "0700: Nurse Blake is concerned about a potential breach of patient privacy. He recently posted an innocuous photo of the hospital cafeteria on his personal social media account, but a reflection in the window inadvertently captured a portion of a patient's medical record visible on a nearby computer screen. The patient, Mr. Jones, is unaware of this.",
        "background": "Mr. Jones was admitted yesterday for observation following a mild stroke. He is stable and alert, but requires ongoing monitoring. Hospital policy strictly prohibits posting any patient-related information, including incidental details, on social media. Previous staff training emphasized the importance of maintaining patient confidentiality in all online activities.",
        "assessment": "Nurse Blake immediately removed the photo upon realizing the potential violation. He has not received any comments or shares on the post. He is unsure of the appropriate steps to take next. He feels terrible.",
        "recommendation": "Nurse Blake needs guidance on addressing this privacy breach and preventing future incidents. He is seeking advice from the charge nurse and nursing supervisor on the best course of action to protect Mr. Jones's privacy and comply with hospital policy."

These individuals are trained to handle privacy breaches, conduct a thorough investigation, and implement corrective actions to mitigate potential harm and prevent future occurrences. This action aligns with institutional policy and legal requirements (HIPAA).",

        "distractorAnalysis": "This is an incorrect answer because it minimizes the importance of proactive reporting and places the burden of discovery on the patient."

      "correct": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates the protection of patient health information. A breach, even unintentional, requires immediate action to mitigate potential harm. Reporting to the privacy officer ensures a proper investigation, risk assessment, and implementation of corrective measures. Failure to report can lead to legal and ethical repercussions for both the individual and the institution. The privacy officer can also guide the nurse on how to communicate with the patient, if necessary, in a way that is compliant with regulations and minimizes distress.",
