    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Using the patient's affirmed name and pronouns validates their identity and mitigates minority stress. This fosters a therapeutic alliance, promoting trust and improving health outcomes. Minority stress, a chronic stress state, increases allostatic load, potentially leading to hypertension and anxiety.",
      "rationale": "Affirming the patient's identity reduces psychological distress and promotes a sense of safety and respect. This is crucial for building a strong nurse-patient relationship and ensuring effective communication. Using the correct name and pronouns acknowledges the patient's autonomy and dignity, which are fundamental principles of patient-centered care. Failure to do so can lead to feelings of invalidation and discrimination, negatively impacting their mental and physical well-being."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. 'Deadnaming' (using the legal name after being informed of the affirmed name) is psychologically harmful, causing distress and activating the sympathetic nervous system (increased heart rate, blood pressure). It erodes the therapeutic alliance and signals disrespect.",
      "rationale": "Deadnaming invalidates the patient's identity and can trigger feelings of dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and trust, making it difficult to provide effective care. The physiological stress response caused by deadnaming can exacerbate existing health conditions and contribute to negative health outcomes. It is essential to prioritize the patient's affirmed name and pronouns to avoid causing harm and promote a safe and supportive environment."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Avoiding names/pronouns is depersonalization and invalidation, creating a communication barrier and perceived microaggression. It hinders therapeutic relationship formation and effective patient-centered education.",
      "rationale": "Depersonalization can make the patient feel invisible and unimportant, leading to feelings of isolation and alienation. This can hinder the nurse's ability to gather a comprehensive health history and provide appropriate care. Avoiding names and pronouns can also be interpreted as a sign of disrespect, further damaging the therapeutic relationship and making it difficult for the patient to trust the healthcare team. It is crucial to actively use the patient's affirmed name and pronouns to demonstrate respect and create a welcoming environment."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Conditional acceptance communicates that the patient's identity is something to hide, inducing shame and anxiety, increasing psychological stress, and undermining patient safety due to reluctance to disclose health concerns.",
      "rationale": "Conditional acceptance implies that the patient's identity is not fully valid or legitimate, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and anxiety. This can create a climate of secrecy and fear, making it difficult for the patient to openly communicate their health concerns, especially those related to their gender identity or mental health. This can compromise patient safety and hinder the nurse's ability to provide comprehensive and effective care. It is essential to provide unconditional acceptance and support to create a safe and affirming environment for the patient."
    }
  },
  "rationale": {
    "correctRationale": "Patient-centered care respects patient autonomy and identity. Using the affirmed name and pronouns mitigates minority stress and builds a therapeutic alliance, essential for accurate assessment, treatment adherence, and improved health outcomes. The affirmed name must be used in all communication and documented in the EHR's 'preferred name' field.",
    "incorrectRationale": "The incorrect options cause psychological harm and compromise care. Deadnaming (Option B) activates a physiological stress response and destroys trust. Avoiding names (Option C) depersonalizes the patient, hindering communication. Conditional acceptance (Option D) creates an unsafe environment, increasing anxiety and discouraging disclosure. These actions increase allostatic load and undermine safe, effective care."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Legal Name vs. Affirmed Name",
    "content": "The trap is misapplying legal identifier rules (medication administration, lab draws) to interpersonal communication. While the legal name is required for formal identification and billing, failing to use the affirmed name and pronouns in conversation and clinical notes (in the designated 'preferred name' field) violates patient-centered care and causes psychological harm."
