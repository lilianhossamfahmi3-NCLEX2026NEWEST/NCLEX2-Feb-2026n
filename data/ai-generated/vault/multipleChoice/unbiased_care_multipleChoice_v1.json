            "content": "Correct. This action directly supports the patient's psychosocial integrity by validating their identity. Using an affirmed name and pronouns mitigates the 'minority stress' response, a chronic stress state that can increase allostatic load and contribute to negative health outcomes such as hypertension and anxiety. This validation is foundational to building a therapeutic alliance, which promotes trust and facilitates more accurate health assessments and better treatment adherence."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Intentionally using a patient's legal name after being informed of their affirmed name is an act known as 'deadnaming.' This action is psychologically harmful, causing acute distress that can activate the sympathetic nervous system (increasing heart rate and blood pressure). It immediately erodes the therapeutic alliance, signaling to the patient that they are not safe or respected, which can lead to withdrawal and avoidance of necessary healthcare."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Avoiding the use of a name or pronouns is a form of depersonalization and invalidation. This approach creates a communication barrier and can be perceived as a microaggression. It prevents the formation of a therapeutic relationship, making it difficult for the nurse to gather a comprehensive health history or provide effective, patient-centered education. The patient may interpret this as a refusal to acknowledge their identity."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This action demonstrates conditional acceptance, which communicates to the patient that their identity is something to be hidden or is not fully legitimate. This can induce feelings of shame and anxiety, increasing psychological stress. Creating such an environment of secrecy undermines patient safety, as the patient may be less willing to openly communicate health concerns, particularly those related to their gender identity or mental health."

    },
    "rationale": {
        "correctRationale": "The core principle of patient-centered care is to respect patient autonomy and identity. Using the patient's affirmed name ('Robin') and pronouns ('they/them') is a crucial nursing action that mitigates the physiological impact of minority stress. This validation builds the therapeutic alliance, which is essential for accurate assessment, treatment adherence, and improved health outcomes. While the legal name is used for specific identification procedures (e.g., medication administration), the affirmed name must be used in all interpersonal communication and documented in the EHR's 'preferred name' field to ensure continuity of respectful care.",
        "incorrectRationale": "The incorrect options cause direct psychological harm and compromise care. Deadnaming (Option B) is an overt act of disrespect that activates a physiological stress response and destroys trust. Avoiding names (Option C) depersonalizes the patient, functioning as a microaggression that hinders communication. Conditional acceptance (Option D) creates an unsafe environment, increasing patient anxiety and discouraging full disclosure of health information. Each of these actions increases the patient's allostatic load and undermines the nurse's ability to provide safe and effective care."

While the legal name is required for formal identification and billing, failing to use the patient's affirmed name and pronouns in conversation and clinical notes (in the designated 'preferred name' field) violates the principle of patient-centered care and causes direct psychological harm."
