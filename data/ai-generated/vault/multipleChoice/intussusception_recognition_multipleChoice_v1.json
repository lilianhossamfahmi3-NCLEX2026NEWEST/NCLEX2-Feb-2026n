    "pathophysiology": "Intussusception occurs when a proximal segment of the bowel telescopes into an adjacent distal segment, most commonly the ileum into the cecum. This invagination obstructs venous and lymphatic drainage, leading to intense inflammation, bowel wall edema, and engorgement. As pressure increases, arterial blood flow is compromised, causing ischemia, mucosal ulceration, and bleeding. Without intervention, this progresses to necrosis, perforation, peritonitis, and shock.",

The pathophysiology involves venous obstruction from the telescoped bowel, leading to engorgement and increased mucus production. Subsequent arterial ischemia causes mucosal sloughing and bleeding. The mixture of this sloughed mucosa, mucus, and dark blood creates the characteristic appearance. Its presence indicates significant vascular compromise and is a late sign that signals an urgent need for intervention to prevent bowel necrosis and perforation."

While hyperactive bowel sounds can be present in the early stages of a mechanical bowel obstruction as the intestine attempts to overcome the blockage through increased peristalsis (borborygmi), it is a non-specific finding. As intussusception progresses and ischemia develops, bowel sounds will become hypoactive or absent. The 'currant jelly' stool is a much more specific and urgent indicator of underlying bowel ischemia."

This congenital anomaly is caused by the absence of ganglion cells in a segment of the colon, leading to a lack of peristalsis and a functional obstruction. Stool is forced through the narrow, aganglionic segment, resulting in its ribbon-like shape. The presentation is typically chronic constipation and abdominal distention from birth, not acute, colicky pain."
