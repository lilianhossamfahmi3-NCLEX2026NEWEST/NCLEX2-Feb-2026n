  "pathophysiology": "Intussusception involves the telescoping of one bowel segment into another (typically ileum into cecum). This obstructs venous and lymphatic flow, causing inflammation, edema, and engorgement. Increased pressure compromises arterial blood flow, leading to ischemia, mucosal ulceration, and bleeding. Without intervention, necrosis, perforation, peritonitis, and shock can occur. The 'currant jelly' stool results from sloughed mucosa, mucus, and blood due to vascular compromise.",

      "optionId": "a",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. 'Currant jelly' stool is a hallmark of intussusception, indicating significant vascular compromise and bowel ischemia. The telescoping bowel obstructs venous outflow, leading to engorgement and mucus production. Arterial ischemia causes mucosal sloughing and bleeding, creating the characteristic stool appearance. This requires immediate intervention to prevent bowel necrosis and perforation.",
      "rationale": "The 'currant jelly' stool is a late sign of intussusception, indicating significant bowel ischemia and potential necrosis. Prioritizing this finding ensures prompt intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Early recognition of intussusception symptoms (sudden, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy) is crucial. The 'currant jelly' stool is a late sign, and its presence indicates a medical emergency."

      "content": "Incorrect. A palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrum is characteristic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), not intussusception. HPS involves hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, causing gastric outlet obstruction.",
      "rationale": "HPS presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting and persistent hunger, unlike the intermittent pain and lethargy seen in intussusception. The palpable mass is the hypertrophied pylorus.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Differentiate between HPS and intussusception based on clinical presentation and physical exam findings. HPS typically presents in younger infants (3-6 weeks) with projectile vomiting."

      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Hyperactive bowel sounds can be present in early bowel obstruction but are non-specific. As intussusception progresses and ischemia develops, bowel sounds will diminish or become absent.",
      "rationale": "While hyperactive bowel sounds may initially occur as the bowel attempts to overcome the obstruction, the 'currant jelly' stool is a more specific and urgent indicator of underlying bowel ischemia and necrosis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor bowel sounds in patients with suspected bowel obstruction. A change from hyperactive to hypoactive or absent bowel sounds can indicate worsening ischemia."

      "rationale": "Hirschsprung's disease typically presents with chronic constipation and abdominal distention from birth, not acute, colicky pain. The ribbon-like stool results from stool being forced through the narrow, aganglionic segment.",

Distinguish between the palpable masses (sausage-shaped vs. olive-shaped) and stool characteristics ('currant jelly' vs. ribbon-like).
