      "content": "**S:** Nurse posted about a patient's 10-minute cardiac arrest on social media without identifiers but included details about the ICU. **B:** Potential HIPAA violation due to risk of patient identification. **A:** The nurse violated the principle of confidentiality. Sharing specific clinical events, even without direct identifiers, can lead to patient identification through a 'jigsaw effect.' A 10-minute cardiac arrest is a unique event. Combining this with the nurse's location and profession increases the risk of identifying the patient. This violates HIPAA, which protects Protected Health Information (PHI). The 'pathophysiology' of this breach is the unauthorized disclosure of PHI, potentially causing psychosocial distress, stigma, or discrimination. **R:** Educate the nurse on HIPAA guidelines and the importance of avoiding any details that could identify patients, even on private social media accounts. **Clinical Pearl:** Always err on the side of caution when posting about work-related experiences online. Even seemingly innocuous details can compromise patient privacy.",

      "content": "**S:** Nurse posted about a patient's 10-minute cardiac arrest on social media. **B:** Concern about sensationalizing a medical emergency. **A:** Veracity is truth-telling. The 'pathophysiology' of a veracity violation is the erosion of trust due to deception. While the hashtags may be unprofessional, the core issue is not the truthfulness of the post but the potential disclosure of identifiable patient information. The post's accuracy is not in question; the ethical breach lies in the risk of identifying the patient. **R:** Review the definition of veracity and its application in nursing practice. **Clinical Pearl:** Focus on the ethical principles directly related to patient privacy and data security when evaluating social media posts.",

      "content": "**S:** Nurse posted about a patient's 10-minute cardiac arrest on social media. **B:** Concern about fairness in mentioning specific patients. **A:** Justice relates to fair resource allocation. The 'pathophysiology' of a justice violation involves systemic bias. This post, while a breach, is an individual act violating one patient's privacy, not a systemic inequity in healthcare resources. The issue is not about treating patients differently but about protecting patient confidentiality. **R:** Review the definition of justice and its application in healthcare. **Clinical Pearl:** Distinguish between individual ethical breaches and systemic issues of fairness and equity.",

The nurse's post usurped the *patient's* autonomy to control who has access to their medical story. The violation is against the patient's right to privacy, not the hospital's right to be informed. The 'pathophysiology' is the infringement on the patient's right to self-determination regarding their health information. **R:** Review the definition of autonomy and its application in patient care. **Clinical Pearl:** Remember that patient autonomy extends to their right to control their health information and who has access to it.",

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is the 'anonymity illusion'—the belief that omitting names and posting on a 'private' account is sufficient to protect patient identity. NGN candidates must recognize that HIPAA protects any information that could reasonably be used to identify a patient. A unique clinical event, like a 10-minute cardiac arrest on a specific unit on a specific day, is a powerful identifier when combined with the nurse's known location and profession.",
  "mnemonics": "To avoid social media breaches, remember the 'SPICER' rule for patient details: Even a **S**ingle **P**iece of **I**nfo **C**an **E**xpose **R**eality.
