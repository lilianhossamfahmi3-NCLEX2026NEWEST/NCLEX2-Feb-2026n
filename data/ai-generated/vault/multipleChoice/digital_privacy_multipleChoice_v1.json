            "content": "This is the correct answer. The 'pathophysiology' of this breach is the 'jigsaw identification' effect. A 10-minute cardiac arrest is a highly specific, low-frequency clinical event. This data point, combined with other publicly available information (the nurse's place of employment, the date of the post), creates a unique identifier. Friends, family, or community members aware of someone being in that specific ICU on that day could easily deduce the patient's identity, thus violating their right to confidentiality under HIPAA. The harm is the unauthorized disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI), leading to potential psychosocial distress, stigma, or discrimination."

            "content": "This is incorrect. Veracity is the principle of truth-telling. The 'pathophysiology' of a veracity violation is the erosion of trust caused by deception or dishonesty. While using hashtags like #NursingLife may be unprofessional and sensationalize a critical event, it does not constitute a lie. The core issue is not the truthfulness of the post but the unauthorized disclosure of identifiable patient information."

            "content": "This is incorrect. The principle of justice relates to the fair and equitable distribution of care and resources. The 'pathophysiology' of a justice violation involves systemic bias, such as prioritizing one patient group over another or allocating resources unfairly. This social media post, while a serious breach, is an individual act that violates one patient's privacy; it does not reflect or create an inequity in the allocation of healthcare resources."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. While the nurse likely violated hospital policy, the primary ethical principle violated is not related to the hospital's authority. Autonomy is the patient's right to make their own informed decisions about their body and their health information. The nurse's post usurped the *patient's* autonomy to control who has access to their personal medical story. The violation is against the patient's right to privacy, not the hospital's right to be informed of an employee's social media activity."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is the 'anonymity illusion'—the belief that omitting names and posting on a 'private' account is sufficient to protect patient identity. NGN candidates must recognize that HIPAA protects any information that could reasonably be used to identify a patient. A unique clinical event, like a 10-minute cardiac arrest on a specific unit on a specific day, is a powerful identifier when combined with the nurse's known location and profession.",
