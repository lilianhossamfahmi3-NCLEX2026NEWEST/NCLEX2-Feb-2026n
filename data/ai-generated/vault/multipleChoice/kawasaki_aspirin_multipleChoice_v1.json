                "content": "This statement is incorrect. While aspirin possesses antipyretic properties by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus, it is not the only option for fever reduction. The high, persistent fever in Kawasaki Disease is driven by a cytokine storm (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1). The primary goal of aspirin therapy is not fever control but to target the underlying systemic vasculitis. Acetaminophen could be used for fever, but aspirin is specifically chosen for its potent anti-inflammatory effects at high doses."

                "optionId": "b",
                "content": "This is the correct rationale. Kawasaki Disease is a systemic vasculitis that preferentially targets the coronary arteries. High-dose aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This action decreases the intense inflammation within the arterial walls, which helps prevent the weakening, dilation, and subsequent formation of coronary artery aneurysms. After the acute phase, low-dose aspirin is continued for its anti-platelet effect, which irreversibly inhibits COX-1 in platelets, preventing the formation of thromboxane A2 and thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis in damaged vessels."

                "content": "This statement is false and provides unsafe information. IVIG is a cornerstone of treatment that modulates the immune system to reduce inflammation, but it has no direct effect on the pathophysiology of Reye Syndrome. Reye Syndrome is a metabolic encephalopathy associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, typically triggered by aspirin use during a viral illness like influenza or varicella. The decision to use aspirin is based on a careful risk-benefit analysis where the high risk of permanent cardiac damage from untreated Kawasaki Disease outweighs the lower risk of developing Reye Syndrome. The healthcare team mitigates this risk by recommending influenza vaccination and monitoring for signs of viral illness."

Initially, a high dose (80-100 mg/kg/day) is administered for its anti-inflammatory effects until the fever subsides. This is followed by a prolonged course of low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/day) for 6-8 weeks, or indefinitely if coronary abnormalities are present, to leverage its anti-platelet effects and prevent clot formation."

Test-takers must recognize that Kawasaki Disease is one of the very few, specific exceptions to this rule.

The question requires prioritizing the specific disease pathophysiology over a general pediatric safety rule.",
