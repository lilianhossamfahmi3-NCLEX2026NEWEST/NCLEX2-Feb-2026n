Administering a Fleet enema is not typically indicated in the acute management of MI and may cause vagal stimulation leading to bradycardia. Encouraging ambulation is contraindicated during the acute phase due to the increased oxygen demand it places on the heart. The rationale for administering oxygen is to increase the oxygen supply to the ischemic myocardium, reducing further damage. Morphine reduces pain and anxiety, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and promoting comfort. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias. Bedrest reduces myocardial oxygen demand and workload during the acute phase of MI.",

Code Status: Full Code.\n\nSituation: Mr. Jones was admitted 30 minutes ago with severe chest pain. He reports a pressure-like sensation radiating to his left arm. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.\n\nBackground: Mr. Jones has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with lisinopril 20mg daily and atorvastatin 40mg daily. He quit smoking 5 years ago, after smoking one pack per day for 30 years. He reports no known allergies.\n\nAssessment: Mr. Jones is currently complaining of 7/10 chest pain. His vital signs are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on room air. He is diaphoretic and anxious. Current medications include aspirin 325mg PO given on arrival and sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4mg given once with minimal relief. 12-lead ECG shows ST elevation. Patient alert and oriented x 4, but very anxious and in pain. Crackles auscultated bilaterally in lower lobes. Denies any family history of early heart disease.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate administration of oxygen via nasal cannula, continuous cardiac monitoring, and further pain management. Consider IV morphine sulfate. Cardiology has been notified and is on their way.",
