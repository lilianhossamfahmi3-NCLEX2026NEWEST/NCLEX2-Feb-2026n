      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position on the left side (Durant's maneuver) is the priority intervention for a suspected venous air embolism. This position helps trap the air in the apex of the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary circulation and causing further obstruction.",
      "pathophysiology": "A venous air embolism occurs when air enters the venous system, typically through an open central line. The air travels to the right side of the heart and can obstruct blood flow to the lungs, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypoxia. The Trendelenburg position on the left side helps trap the air in the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary artery.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Rapid recognition and intervention are crucial in managing venous air embolisms. The 'churning' sound (mill-wheel murmur) is a classic sign. Remember to also clamp the central line, administer oxygen, and notify the physician."

    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Chest compressions are indicated for cardiac arrest (absence of pulse). The patient is tachycardic, indicating a pulse is present. Performing chest compressions on a patient with a pulse is contraindicated.",
      "pathophysiology": "Chest compressions are designed to manually circulate blood when the heart is not effectively pumping. In this scenario, the heart is still beating, but its function is compromised by the air embolism. Chest compressions would not address the underlying cause of the problem.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Always assess for a pulse before initiating chest compressions. Follow ACLS guidelines for managing cardiac arrest."

    "c": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "While assessing lung sounds is important, it is not the priority action in this emergency situation. The patient's symptoms and the 'churning' sound strongly suggest a venous air embolism, requiring immediate intervention.",
      "pathophysiology": "The 'churning' sound is a specific indicator of air in the heart. Auscultating the lungs may reveal decreased breath sounds, but this finding is less specific and does not provide the immediate information needed to guide treatment.",
      "clinicalPearls": "In emergency situations, prioritize interventions based on the most likely diagnosis and the severity of the patient's condition. Delaying treatment to perform further assessments can worsen the outcome."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Slowing the TPN infusion is not the priority action. The source of the air embolism is likely the open central line hub, not the TPN solution itself. The immediate priority is to prevent further air from entering the venous system.",
      "pathophysiology": "Air enters the venous system through an open central line due to negative pressure during inspiration. Slowing the TPN infusion will not stop the air from entering. The central line needs to be clamped to prevent further air entry.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Always ensure that central lines are properly clamped and secured during tubing changes to prevent air embolisms."

The 'churning' sound is a pathognomonic sign of a venous air embolism, requiring immediate intervention.
