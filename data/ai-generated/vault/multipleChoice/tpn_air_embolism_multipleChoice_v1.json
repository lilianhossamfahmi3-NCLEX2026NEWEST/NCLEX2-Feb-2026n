Vital signs: HR 120, RR 30, SpO2 90% on room air, BP 90/60.\nRecommendation: Immediately place the patient in the Trendelenburg position on the left side (Durant's maneuver). Clamp the central line. Administer oxygen. Notify the physician STAT. Prepare for potential interventions such as central line aspiration and vasopressor administration. Monitor vital signs closely every 5 minutes. Document event and interventions."
