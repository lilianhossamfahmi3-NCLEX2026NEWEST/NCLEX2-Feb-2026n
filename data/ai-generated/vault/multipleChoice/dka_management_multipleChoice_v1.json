            "content": "The primary therapeutic goal in DKA shifts once blood glucose approaches 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L). While hyperglycemia is improving, the metabolic acidosis and ketonemia are not yet resolved. Continuous insulin infusion is required to suppress hepatic ketogenesis (the production of ketone bodies) and allow cells to utilize glucose. To prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia from the ongoing insulin infusion, a dextrose-containing solution (e.g., 5% Dextrose in 0.45% Normal Saline) is initiated. This provides an exogenous glucose source, allowing the insulin drip to be safely continued to close the anion gap and resolve the acidosis."

            "content": "0.9% Normal Saline is the standard initial fluid for aggressive volume resuscitation in DKA. The severe hyperglycemia causes profound osmotic diuresis, leading to significant dehydration and hypovolemia. However, at this stage of treatment, with the blood glucose at 240 mg/dL, continuing with only an isotonic, non-dextrose fluid while administering IV insulin places the patient at high risk for a rapid drop in blood glucose, leading to dangerous hypoglycemia. The treatment priority has shifted from pure volume expansion to safely resolving the underlying metabolic acidosis."

            "content": "Lactated Ringer's (LR) is an isotonic crystalloid but is generally not the preferred fluid for DKA management. The liver metabolizes the lactate in LR into bicarbonate. In DKA, hepatic function and perfusion may be compromised, potentially impairing this conversion and failing to effectively correct the metabolic acidosis. While some protocols may use it, the standard of care, especially when transitioning to a maintenance fluid, is a saline-based solution. Furthermore, this option lacks the essential dextrose needed at this glucose level to prevent hypoglycemia from the insulin infusion."

            "content": "3% Hypertonic Saline is a hyperosmolar fluid used specifically to treat severe, symptomatic hyponatremia or to reduce cerebral edema by osmotically drawing water from brain cells. Patients in DKA are already in a state of severe hyperosmolarity due to hyperglycemia. Administering 3% saline would dangerously exacerbate this hyperosmolar state, worsening cellular dehydration (especially in the brain) and increasing the risk of severe neurological complications, such as central pontine myelinolysis or seizures. This intervention is contraindicated in this clinical scenario."

    ],
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is focusing solely on the blood glucose value of 240 mg/dL, which is still elevated, and concluding that administering dextrose is incorrect. This overlooks the core pathophysiology of DKA: the goal of the insulin infusion is to stop ketogenesis and resolve acidosis, not just to lower blood glucose. The dextrose is a 'safety net' that allows the insulin to continue working on the acidosis without causing a hypoglycemic crisis.",
    "mnemonics": "'When the sugar hits 250, get the D5 ready to go!' This reminds the nurse of the specific blood glucose threshold for changing IV fluids. Another mnemonic is 'Insulin for the acid, Dextrose for the brain,' highlighting the dual goals of resolving ketoacidosis while preventing hypoglycemia and protecting neurological function.",
