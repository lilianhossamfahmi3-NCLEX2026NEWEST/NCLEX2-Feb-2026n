This hypovolemia is the immediate threat. 0.9% Normal Saline at 1 L/hr is the priority to restore intravascular volume, stabilize BP, improve renal perfusion (aiding glucose clearance), and prevent hypovolemic shock.",

No recent illnesses reported.\nAssessment: Patient is alert but confused. Blood glucose is 840 mg/dL. Appears severely dehydrated (dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor). Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, Temp 38.5°C. Urine ketones negative. Labs pending.\nRecommendation: Initiate IV infusion of 0.9% Normal Saline at 1 L/hr immediately to address hypovolemia. Monitor vital signs, urine output, and neurological status closely. Obtain further orders for insulin administration and electrolyte replacement based on lab results. Notify provider of patient's status and response to treatment. Consider obtaining cultures to rule out infection."
