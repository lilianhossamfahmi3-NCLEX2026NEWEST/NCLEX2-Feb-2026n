      "a": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. Sodium 148 mEq/L indicates hypernatremia. In Addisonian crisis, aldosterone deficiency leads to impaired sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, causing hyponatremia (typically <135 mEq/L). This sodium loss contributes to hypovolemia and hypotension. The expected finding is low sodium, not high."
      },
      "b": {
        "correct": true,
        "content": "Correct. Potassium 5.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. In Addisonian crisis, aldosterone deficiency causes potassium retention, leading to hyperkalemia (K+ > 5.0 mEq/L). Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance that can cause cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitor ECG for peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and potential ventricular fibrillation. Immediate treatment is required to stabilize the cardiac membrane and shift potassium intracellularly."

      "c": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. Glucose 180 mg/dL indicates hyperglycemia. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, stimulates gluconeogenesis. In Addisonian crisis, cortisol deficiency impairs glucose production, especially during stress, leading to hypoglycemia (often <70 mg/dL). The expected finding is low glucose, contributing to weakness and confusion."
      },
      "d": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. Calcium 8.2 mg/dL is low-normal. While chronic adrenal insufficiency can sometimes be associated with hypercalcemia due to hemoconcentration, this value is not a primary diagnostic marker for acute Addisonian crisis. The focus is on sodium, potassium, and glucose imbalances."
      }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing Addison's disease (hormone deficiency) with Cushing's syndrome (hormone excess). Cushing's involves excess cortisol and aldosterone, leading to hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. Candidates must link aldosterone to sodium/potassium balance and cortisol to glucose regulation to identify the correct lab values for a deficiency state.",
    "mnemonics": "Remember 'Addison's: Need to ADD steroids'. Think 'Low Down': Low sodium, low glucose. 'High Up': High potassium.",
    "pathophysiology": "Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening condition caused by acute adrenal insufficiency, most commonly triggered by stress (e.g., infection, surgery, trauma) in individuals with underlying Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) or abrupt cessation of long-term corticosteroid therapy (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone leads to impaired glucose regulation (hypoglycemia), decreased sodium reabsorption and increased potassium retention in the kidneys (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, respectively), and hypovolemia due to sodium and water loss. The resulting hypotension, weakness, and confusion require immediate intervention with fluid resuscitation and glucocorticoid replacement.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitor ECG continuously for hyperkalemia-induced dysrhythmias. Administer IV fluids (normal saline) to correct hypovolemia. Give hydrocortisone IV bolus as initial treatment. Monitor glucose levels frequently and treat hypoglycemia with dextrose. Identify and treat the underlying cause (e.g., infection). Teach patients with Addison's disease about stress dosing of steroids during illness or surgery. Always assess for medication non-adherence as a potential cause of crisis.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
