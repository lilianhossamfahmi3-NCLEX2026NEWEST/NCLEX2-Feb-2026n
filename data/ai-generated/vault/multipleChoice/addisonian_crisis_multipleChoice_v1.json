                "content": "Incorrect. This value represents hypernatremia. In an Addisonian crisis, a profound deficiency of aldosterone prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing sodium and water at the distal tubules. This leads to massive urinary sodium loss (natriuresis), resulting in severe hyponatremia (typically < 135 mEq/L) and hypovolemia, which directly contributes to the patient's hypotension."

                "correct": true,
                "content": "Correct. This value indicates hyperkalemia. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion in the kidneys. During an Addisonian crisis, the absence of aldosterone causes potassium retention. This leads to hyperkalemia (K+ > 5.0 mEq/L), which is a life-threatening emergency as it can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, and ventricular fibrillation."

            "c": {
                "correct": false,
                "content": "Incorrect. This value represents hyperglycemia. A key function of cortisol (a glucocorticoid) is to stimulate gluconeogenesis in the liver and decrease peripheral glucose uptake, thereby raising blood sugar. In an Addisonian crisis, the acute lack of cortisol impairs the body's ability to produce glucose, especially under stress (like an infection), leading to profound hypoglycemia (often < 70 mg/dL), which contributes to weakness and confusion."
            },
            "d": {
                "correct": false,
                "content": "Incorrect. This calcium level is low-normal (normal range is typically 8.5-10.5 mg/dL) and is not a primary diagnostic marker for an acute Addisonian crisis. While chronic adrenal insufficiency can sometimes be associated with hypercalcemia due to hemoconcentration and decreased renal clearance, this value is irrelevant to the acute, life-threatening pathophysiology of the crisis, which centers on sodium, potassium, and glucose imbalances."
            }
        },
        "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the hormonal deficits of Addison's disease with the hormonal excess of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome involves excess cortisol and aldosterone, leading to the opposite findings: hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. Candidates must correctly link the specific hormone (aldosterone, cortisol) to its function (sodium/potassium balance, glucose regulation) to identify the correct lab values for a deficiency state.",
        "mnemonics": "For Addison's Disease lab values, remember the phrase 'Some People Get Cold': S (Sodium low), P (Potassium high), G (Glucose low), C (Calcium high - in chronic states). For the crisis, focus on the acute changes: Down for Sodium & Sugar, Up for Potassium."
