                "content": "Incorrect. While chronic adrenal insufficiency can sometimes be associated with hypercalcemia, a calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL is within the low-normal range and not a primary diagnostic marker for acute Addisonian crisis. The focus is on sodium, potassium, and glucose imbalances."

        },
        "questionTrap": "The trap is confusing Addison's disease (hormone deficiency) with Cushing's syndrome (hormone excess). Cushing's involves excess cortisol and aldosterone, leading to hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. Candidates must link aldosterone to sodium/potassium balance and cortisol to glucose regulation to identify the correct lab values for a deficiency state.",
        "mnemonics": "Remember 'Addison's: Need to ADD steroids'. Think 'Low Down': Low sodium, low glucose. 'High Up': High potassium.",
        "pathophysiology": "Addisonian crisis is caused by acute adrenal insufficiency, often triggered by stress in individuals with Addison's disease or abrupt cessation of long-term corticosteroid therapy. The deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone leads to impaired glucose regulation (hypoglycemia), decreased sodium reabsorption and increased potassium retention (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), and hypovolemia. This results in hypotension, weakness, and confusion, requiring immediate intervention.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor ECG for hyperkalemia-induced dysrhythmias. Administer IV fluids (normal saline) to correct hypovolemia. Give hydrocortisone IV bolus as initial treatment. Monitor glucose levels frequently and treat hypoglycemia with dextrose. Identify and treat the underlying cause. Teach patients about stress dosing of steroids. Assess for medication non-adherence.",
        "correct": "The patient's hypotension, weakness, and confusion following a respiratory infection, combined with a history of Addison's disease, strongly suggest an Addisonian crisis. The most expected laboratory finding is hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency."
