The goal is to reduce ammonia levels and improve mental status. A patient could have the target number of bowel movements but still have encephalopathy if ammonia production is high or the lactulose dose is insufficient. Neurological improvement is the ultimate clinical endpoint.",

Reduced bilirubin signifies improved overall liver function, not a direct lactulose effect.",

Bowel movements have not occurred since admission. Abdomen is distended. Potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L.\nRecommendation: 1420: Recommend increasing lactulose dose per protocol and administering potassium supplement. Continue to monitor mental status, bowel movements, and electrolyte levels. Consider enema if no bowel movement occurs within the next 6 hours. Notify provider of any worsening mental status or electrolyte imbalances."
