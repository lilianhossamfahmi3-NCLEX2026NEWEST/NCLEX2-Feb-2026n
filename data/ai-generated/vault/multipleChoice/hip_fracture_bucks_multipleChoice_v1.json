    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "This is the correct answer. Buck's traction applies continuous longitudinal force to the affected limb, counteracting muscle spasms post-femoral fracture. The freely hanging weight provides this force. If the weight rests on the floor, the traction force is lost. This causes muscle spasms, severe pain, fracture fragment malalignment, and increased risk of soft tissue damage, bleeding, or neurovascular injury from bone ends. The weight must hang freely to maintain effective traction.",
      "rationale": "Buck's traction reduces muscle spasms and maintains alignment by applying a constant pulling force. When the weight is on the floor, this force is absent, leading to increased pain and potential complications. The traction's effectiveness depends on the consistent application of the prescribed weight.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the weights are freely hanging and not obstructed by the bed, floor, or any other object. Regularly inspect the traction setup to maintain its therapeutic effect."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect answer. Slight external rotation is a common sign of a hip fracture, especially extracapsular or displaced intracapsular fractures. The fracture disrupts the femur's integrity, allowing external rotator muscles (e.g., gluteus maximus) to pull the distal fragment outward. Buck's traction aims to reduce this rotation, but some residual rotation is expected and not an immediate danger. Pre-operative traction primarily controls pain and reduces spasms, not achieving perfect alignment.",
      "rationale": "External rotation occurs due to muscle imbalances caused by the fracture. While traction helps, complete correction isn't always immediate. Focusing on pain management and preventing further injury is the priority.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Assess the degree of external rotation regularly, but recognize that some rotation may persist despite traction. Report any significant increase in rotation or associated pain."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect answer. Using a boot with Velcro straps is the standard method for applying Buck's skin traction. The boot distributes the pulling force across the lower leg skin, preventing excessive pressure on one point. Velcro straps ensure a secure fit, accommodate minor swelling, and allow for neurovascular and skin integrity checks. This indicates proper traction setup.",
      "rationale": "The boot and Velcro straps are designed to safely and effectively apply traction to the skin. They minimize the risk of skin breakdown and allow for easy monitoring of the limb.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the boot is properly fitted and the straps are not too tight to avoid compromising circulation. Regularly assess the skin under the boot for any signs of irritation or breakdown."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect answer. Placing a small pillow under the lower leg (calf) is a standard comfort measure that also serves a therapeutic purpose. It elevates the heel off the mattress, preventing pressure injury on a bony prominence. This positioning doesn't interfere with traction mechanics if the pillow doesn't lift the entire leg, create a sharp knee angle (compressing the popliteal artery/peroneal nerve), or disrupt the straight line of pull. The principle is to maintain the line of pull while protecting skin integrity.",
      "rationale": "Elevating the heel prevents pressure ulcers, a common complication of immobility. As long as the traction line remains straight, this is an acceptable comfort measure.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the pillow is small enough to avoid altering the traction's line of pull. Regularly assess the heel for any signs of pressure."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Traction Principles vs. Expected Findings",
    "content": "The key is differentiating between a critical traction setup failure and an expected injury sign. Slight external rotation (Option B) is a classic hip fracture sign; traction aims to correct it, but its presence isn't an immediate crisis. The critical error is interrupting the traction force (Option A). Understand that traction's core principle is continuous, uninterrupted pull. Any action breaking this 'line of pull' or negating the force (weights on the floor) is a priority problem requiring immediate intervention."

  "mnemonics": {
    "title": "Traction Care: 'TRACTION'",
    "content": "Use this mnemonic to recall key nursing assessments and interventions for a patient in traction:\n- **T**emperature & **T**rauma: Check extremity temperature and assess for signs of neurovascular compromise (the 6 P's). Compare with the unaffected limb.\n- **R**opes hang freely: Ensure ropes are in the pulley track and weights are off the floor and not touching the bed.\n- **A**lignment: Maintain proper body alignment. The patient should be centered in the bed, not slumped to one side.\n- **C**irculation Check: Perform frequent neurovascular checks (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia).\n- **T**ype & Location of Fracture: Be aware of the specific injury to anticipate potential complications.\n- **I**ncrease Fluids & Fiber: Prevent complications of immobility like constipation and renal calculi.\n- **O**verhead Trapeze: Encourage use to assist with movement, repositioning, and preventing shear/friction.\n- **N**o interference: Nothing should obstruct the line of pull or rest on the ropes."

    "assessment": "At 0900, the 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight is resting on the floor, compromising the traction's effectiveness. Neurovascular status of the right leg is currently intact: Pedal pulse 2+, warm, and patient reports no numbness or tingling. Pain level is 4/10.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately reposition the weight so it hangs freely. Reassess and document the patient's pain level and neurovascular status in 15 minutes. Notify the healthcare provider if pain is uncontrolled (above 6/10) or neurovascular compromise is present (decreased pulse, coolness, numbness, tingling). Ensure the patient understands the importance of maintaining proper alignment and not interfering with the traction. Educate patient to call for assistance if the weight becomes displaced.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Maintaining the effectiveness of Buck's traction is crucial for reducing muscle spasms and pain in a patient with a hip fracture awaiting surgery. The traction works by applying a continuous pulling force to the affected limb, which is achieved through the freely hanging weight. If the weight is resting on the floor, this force is lost, leading to increased pain, muscle spasms, and potential malalignment of the fracture. Therefore, ensuring the weight hangs freely is the priority to maintain the therapeutic effect of the traction."
