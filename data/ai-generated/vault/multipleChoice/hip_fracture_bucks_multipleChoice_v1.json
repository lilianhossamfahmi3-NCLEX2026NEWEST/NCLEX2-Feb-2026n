            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is the correct answer. Buck's traction operates on the principle of applying a continuous, longitudinal pulling force to the affected limb. This force, created by the freely hanging weight, counteracts the powerful spasms of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles that occur reflexively after a femoral fracture. When the weight rests on the floor, the vector of force is neutralized (becomes zero). This sudden loss of traction allows the muscles to spasm violently, causing excruciating pain, overriding and malalignment of the fracture fragments, and increasing the risk of further soft tissue damage, bleeding, or neurovascular injury from the sharp bone ends."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect answer. A slight external rotation is the classic clinical sign of a hip fracture, particularly an extracapsular or displaced intracapsular fracture. This occurs because the fracture disrupts the structural integrity of the femur, allowing the powerful external rotator muscles of the hip (e.g., gluteus maximus, piriformis) to pull the distal fragment outward without opposition. While Buck's traction is intended to reduce this rotation and realign the limb, some degree of residual rotation is expected and does not signify a failure of the traction or an immediate danger. The primary goals of pre-operative traction are pain control and spasm reduction, not perfect anatomical alignment."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect answer. The use of a boot with Velcro straps is the standard, correct method for applying Buck's (skin) traction. The boot serves as the interface to distribute the pulling force across the skin of the lower leg without causing excessive pressure on one single point. The Velcro straps allow for a secure fit that can be easily adjusted to accommodate minor swelling and for regular neurovascular and skin integrity checks. This finding represents the proper setup of the traction apparatus."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect answer. Placing a small pillow under the lower leg (calf) is a standard comfort measure that also serves a therapeutic purpose. It elevates the heel completely off the mattress, preventing the development of a pressure injury on a high-risk bony prominence. This positioning does not interfere with the mechanics of the traction as long as the pillow does not lift the entire leg, create a sharp angle at the knee (which could compress the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve), or disrupt the straight line of pull from the hip through the pulley. The principle is to maintain the line of pull while protecting skin integrity."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "Traction Principles vs. Expected Findings",
        "content": "The primary trap in this question is differentiating between a critical failure in the traction setup and an expected pathophysiological sign of the injury itself. The slight external rotation (Option B) is a classic sign of a hip fracture; while traction aims to correct it, its presence is not an immediate crisis. The critical error is the interruption of the traction force (Option A). Candidates must understand that the core principle of traction is a continuous, uninterrupted pull. Any action or finding that breaks this 'line of pull' or negates the force (like weights on the floor or the patient sliding down in bed) is a priority problem requiring immediate intervention."

        "title": "Traction Care: 'TRACTION'",
        "content": "Use this mnemonic to recall key nursing assessments and interventions for a patient in traction:\n- **T**emperature & **T**rauma: Check extremity temperature and assess for signs of neurovascular compromise (the 6 P's). Compare with the unaffected limb.\n- **R**opes hang freely: Ensure ropes are in the pulley track and weights are off the floor and not touching the bed.\n- **A**lignment: Maintain proper body alignment. The patient should be centered in the bed, not slumped to one side.\n- **C**irculation Check: Perform frequent neurovascular checks (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia).\n- **T**ype & Location of Fracture: Be aware of the specific injury to anticipate potential complications.\n- **I**ncrease Fluids & Fiber: Prevent complications of immobility like constipation and renal calculi.\n- **O**verhead Trapeze: Encourage use to assist with movement, repositioning, and preventing shear/friction.\n- **N**o interference: Nothing should obstruct the line of pull or rest on the ropes."
