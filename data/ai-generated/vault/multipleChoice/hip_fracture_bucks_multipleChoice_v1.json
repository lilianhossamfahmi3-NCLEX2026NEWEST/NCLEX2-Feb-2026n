        "correct": "Maintaining the effectiveness of Buck's traction is crucial for reducing muscle spasms and pain in a patient with a hip fracture awaiting surgery. The traction works by applying a continuous pulling force to the affected limb, which is achieved through the freely hanging weight. If the weight is resting on the floor, this force is lost, leading to increased pain, muscle spasms, and potential malalignment of the fracture. Therefore, ensuring the weight hangs freely is the priority to maintain the therapeutic effect of the traction.",

Slight external rotation (Option B) is a classic hip fracture sign; traction aims to correct it, but its presence isn't an immediate crisis. The critical error is interrupting the traction force (Option A). Understand that traction's core principle is continuous, uninterrupted pull. Any action breaking this 'line of pull' or negating the force (weights on the floor) is a priority problem requiring immediate intervention."

The patient should be centered in the bed, not slumped to one side.\n- **C**irculation Check: Perform frequent neurovascular checks (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia).\n- **T**ype & Location of Fracture: Be aware of the specific injury to anticipate potential complications.\n- **I**ncrease Fluids & Fiber: Prevent complications of immobility like constipation and renal calculi.\n- **O**verhead Trapeze: Encourage use to assist with movement, repositioning, and preventing shear/friction.\n- **N**o interference: Nothing should obstruct the line of pull or rest on the ropes."

                "label": "A",
                "content": "This is the correct answer. Buck's traction applies continuous longitudinal force to the affected limb, counteracting muscle spasms post-femoral fracture. The freely hanging weight provides this force. If the weight rests on the floor, the traction force is lost. This causes muscle spasms, severe pain, fracture fragment malalignment, and increased risk of soft tissue damage, bleeding, or neurovascular injury from bone ends. The weight must hang freely to maintain effective traction.",

                "content": "This is an incorrect answer. Slight external rotation is a common sign of a hip fracture, especially extracapsular or displaced intracapsular fractures. The fracture disrupts the femur's integrity, allowing external rotator muscles (e.g., gluteus maximus) to pull the distal fragment outward. Buck's traction aims to reduce this rotation, but some residual rotation is expected and not an immediate danger. Pre-operative traction primarily controls pain and reduces spasms, not achieving perfect alignment.",

The boot distributes the pulling force across the lower leg skin, preventing excessive pressure on one point. Velcro straps ensure a secure fit, accommodate minor swelling, and allow for neurovascular and skin integrity checks. This indicates proper traction setup.",

It elevates the heel off the mattress, preventing pressure injury on a bony prominence. This positioning doesn't interfere with traction mechanics if the pillow doesn't lift the entire leg, create a sharp knee angle (compressing the popliteal artery/peroneal nerve), or disrupt the straight line of pull. The principle is to maintain the line of pull while protecting skin integrity.",

        "sbar": "Situation: Patient with a right hip fracture in Buck's traction.\nBackground: Patient is awaiting surgery. Buck's traction was applied at 0800 to reduce muscle spasms and pain.\nAssessment: At 0900, the 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight is resting on the floor, compromising the traction's effectiveness. Neurovascular status of the right leg is currently intact: Pedal pulse 2+, warm, and patient reports no numbness or tingling. Pain level is 4/10.\nRecommendation: Immediately reposition the weight so it hangs freely. Reassess and document the patient's pain level and neurovascular status in 15 minutes. Notify the healthcare provider if pain is uncontrolled (above 6/10) or neurovascular compromise is present (decreased pulse, coolness, numbness, tingling). Ensure the patient understands the importance of maintaining proper alignment and not interfering with the traction. Educate patient to call for assistance if the weight becomes displaced."
