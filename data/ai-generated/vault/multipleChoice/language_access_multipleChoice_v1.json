Certified interpreters ensure accuracy, neutrality, and cultural competence. While familial support is important, it does not replace the legal and ethical requirement for professional interpretation in complex medical scenarios.",

Translation apps and hand gestures are insufficient for the legal requirements of 'informed' consent, especially for surgical risks.
