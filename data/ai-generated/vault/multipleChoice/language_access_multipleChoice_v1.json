For example, if a patient cannot accurately report a malignant hyperthermia history due to translation errors, succinylcholine administration could trigger a crisis. This involves uncontrolled sarcoplasmic calcium release, causing muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia (arrhythmia risk), and rapid temperature rise leading to CNS damage. Misunderstood post-operative ambulation instructions can cause venous stasis, increasing DVT/PE risk, leading to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.",
