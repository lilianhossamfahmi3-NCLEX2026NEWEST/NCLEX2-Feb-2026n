            "correct": "HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count) is a severe form of preeclampsia. The definitive treatment is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Magnesium sulfate is indicated to prevent seizures (eclampsia). Given the gestational age and severity of HELLP, immediate delivery is the most appropriate intervention. Delaying delivery to administer betamethasone or attempting to manage with antihypertensives alone increases the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Induction with oxytocin may be considered if the patient is stable enough for a trial of labor, but in the setting of HELLP, prompt delivery, often via cesarean section, is preferred.",
            "incorrect": "Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not address the immediate need for delivery in HELLP syndrome. Antihypertensives (Option B) manage blood pressure but do not resolve the underlying HELLP pathology. Induction of labor (Option C) may be considered in less severe preeclampsia but is too slow for HELLP. Betamethasone (Option D) is for fetal lung maturity but is secondary to maternal stabilization and delivery.",
