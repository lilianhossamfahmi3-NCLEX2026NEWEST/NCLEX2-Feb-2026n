A Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 15-20 mL/kg (in this case, 12 mL/kg) is a direct, objective measure of this severe weakness, indicating impending alveolar hypoventilation and the need for immediate ventilatory support.",

                "content": "This is the correct answer. Myasthenic crisis is pathologically defined by the failure of respiratory muscles (diaphragm, intercostals) due to an insufficient amount of acetylcholine stimulation at the neuromuscular junction. This leads to an inability to generate adequate negative inspiratory pressure and tidal volume. The Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) directly measures the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled. A value of 12 mL/kg is critically low (normal is ~60 mL/kg; crisis threshold is <15-20 mL/kg) and quantifies the severity of respiratory muscle weakness, signifying imminent respiratory arrest."

While worsening of these symptoms indicates a disease exacerbation, they do not define a myasthenic crisis. A patient can have severe ocular and facial weakness without the life-threatening respiratory compromise that constitutes a crisis."

Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the availability of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. A positive test (temporary improvement in strength) helps differentiate a myasthenic crisis (undermedication) from a cholinergic crisis (overmedication). The critical finding that signals the crisis itself is the severe respiratory failure (e.g., low FVC), which necessitates intervention regardless of the Tensilon test result."

The Tensilon test confirms the *cause* of the weakness is undermedication, but the *severity* and *definition* of the crisis hinge on the degree of respiratory muscle failure. The NCLEX requires prioritizing the finding that signals the most immediate life threat, which is the objective measurement of respiratory compromise (FVC), not the result of a diagnostic test or other, less specific symptoms."
