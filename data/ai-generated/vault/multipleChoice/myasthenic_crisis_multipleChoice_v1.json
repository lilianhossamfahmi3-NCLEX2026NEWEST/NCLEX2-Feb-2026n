Their Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is 12 mL/kg, indicating significant respiratory muscle weakness. Heart rate is 110 bpm, and they are diaphoretic. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air.\nRecommendation: The patient is exhibiting signs of Myasthenic Crisis and requires immediate respiratory support. Prepare for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Notify the physician immediately and anticipate orders for arterial blood gas analysis and Tensilon test. Hold pyridostigmine until the cause of the crisis is determined."
