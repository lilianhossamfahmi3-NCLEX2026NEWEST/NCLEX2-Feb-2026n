            "content": "This is the correct action. The phlebostatic axis (fourth intercostal space, mid-axillary line) approximates the level of the right atrium, which serves as the zero reference point for the central circulation. According to the principles of fluid dynamics, the pressure exerted by a column of fluid (hydrostatic pressure) can alter the reading. By leveling the air-fluid interface of the transducer to this specific anatomical landmark, the nurse negates the influence of hydrostatic pressure from the fluid-filled tubing. If the transducer is positioned too low, the weight of the fluid column adds pressure, creating a falsely high reading. Conversely, if positioned too high, a siphon effect reduces the measured pressure, yielding a falsely low reading. This step is the foundational priority for ensuring the electronic system accurately reflects the patient's intravascular pressure."

            "content": "This is incorrect. A large-volume manual flush of 10 mL is not a standard procedure for ensuring accuracy and poses significant risk. Rapidly injecting fluid retrograde into the radial artery can dislodge microthrombi, leading to distal embolization in the hand or, more dangerously, retrograde cerebral embolization. While a 'fast-flush' or 'square wave test' is used to assess the dynamic response (damping) of the system, it involves a very brief, high-pressure flush from the device, not a manual 10 mL bolus. The primary method for maintaining patency is a continuous, low-volume infusion (e.g., 3 mL/hr) from the pressurized saline bag, not intermittent large-volume flushes."

            "text": "Apply a pressure bag set to 150 mmHg.",
            "content": "This is incorrect because the pressure is insufficient. The pressure bag's function is to overcome the patient's own arterial pressure to prevent blood from backflowing into the catheter and tubing, which would cause thrombosis and occlusion. The standard pressure setting is 300 mmHg. Setting the bag to 150 mmHg would be inadequate for a patient whose systolic blood pressure exceeds this value (which is common), leading to a failure of the continuous flush system, blood reflux into the line, thrombus formation, and a dampened, inaccurate pressure waveform."

            "content": "This is incorrect because of the timing and purpose. The Allen test is a critical safety assessment performed *before* arterial cannulation. Its purpose is to verify adequate collateral circulation to the hand via the ulnar artery, ensuring hand perfusion will be maintained if the radial artery becomes occluded by the catheter or a thrombus. Performing this test *after* the line is already inserted is futile for its intended purpose and has no impact on the *accuracy* of the pressure readings generated by the hemodynamic monitoring system. It is a pre-procedural safety check, not a post-procedural calibration or accuracy check."

        "content": "The primary trap in this question is distinguishing between essential tasks related to arterial line management. Test-takers may confuse a pre-procedure safety check (Allen test), a system maintenance requirement (pressure bag), or a patency-related action (flushing) with the single most critical step for ensuring the *accuracy* of the reading itself. The stem specifically asks for the priority action to ensure *accuracy*, which directly points to the physics of leveling and zeroing the transducer."

This reinforces that the transducer must be physically level with the phlebostatic axis, which is the external landmark for the right atrium. Another helpful phrase is: 'High or Low, the reading's a no-go'. If the transducer is too high, the reading is falsely low. If the transducer is too low, the reading is falsely high."
