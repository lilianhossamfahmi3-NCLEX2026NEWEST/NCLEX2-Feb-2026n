        "correct": "For accurate hemodynamic pressure readings, the transducer must be leveled at the phlebostatic axis (4th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line), which represents the level of the right atrium. If the transducer is too high, the pressure reading will be falsely low; if it is too low, the reading will be falsely high. This leveling ensures that the pressure recorded is a true reflection of the patient's internal vascular pressure without the effects of hydrostatic pressure.",
        "incorrect": "Flushing with 10 mL is excessive and could cause fluid overload or arterial trauma. Pressure bags should be maintained at 300 mmHg, not 150 mmHg, to overcome arterial pressure and maintain patency (3 mL/hr flush). The Allen test must be performed PRIOR to insertion to verify collateral circulation; performing it after insertion is redundant and does not ensure the 'accuracy of readings'.",
