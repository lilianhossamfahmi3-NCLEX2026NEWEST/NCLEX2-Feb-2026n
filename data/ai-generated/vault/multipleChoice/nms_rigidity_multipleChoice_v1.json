The pathophysiology involves central dopamine D2 receptor blockade, leading to a hypermetabolic state. Dantrolene is the specific antidote because it is a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It acts on the sarcoplasmic reticulum to inhibit the release of calcium (Ca2+), which is necessary for muscle contraction. By blocking this calcium release, Dantrolene directly counteracts the severe rigidity, which in turn reduces heat production and prevents rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), addressing the core life-threatening features of NMS."

While also caused by dopamine blockade, EPS is a distinct and less severe condition. Administering benztropine is incorrect because it fails to address the underlying hypermetabolic state of NMS. Critically, its anticholinergic properties can block diaphoresis (sweating), thereby exacerbating the life-threatening hyperthermia."

While it may be used as an adjunctive therapy in NMS to manage agitation, it is not the primary, life-saving treatment. It does not correct the core pathophysiological problem of uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Relying on Lorazepam alone fails to treat the severe rigidity and hyperthermia, which are the primary sources of mortality in NMS."

The patient's symptoms of hyperthermia and autonomic instability have some overlap with Serotonin Syndrome. Introducing a potent serotonergic agent could confuse the clinical picture or induce Serotonin Syndrome concurrently. Fluoxetine has no therapeutic effect on the dopamine blockade or the resultant muscle pathology of NMS."

The key differentiator is the presence of extreme fever (hyperpyrexia) and altered mental status along with the rigidity, which signals a systemic emergency (NMS) rather than a localized motor side effect (EPS). Another trap is confusing NMS with Serotonin Syndrome; NMS is characterized by 'lead-pipe' rigidity and hyporeflexia, whereas Serotonin Syndrome typically involves hyperreflexia and myoclonus.",
