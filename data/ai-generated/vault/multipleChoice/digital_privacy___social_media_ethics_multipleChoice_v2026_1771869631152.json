This principle is violated because even without specific patient identifiers, posting about a patient's condition, even in a generalized manner, can potentially lead to a breach of confidentiality and erode public trust in the nursing profession. It creates a risk of harm, even if unintended, and fails to uphold the nurse's responsibility to protect patient privacy. It also could violate HIPAA regulations."

So exhausting!\" Consider the ethical implications of this social media post in relation to the nurse's professional responsibilities and patient confidentiality."
