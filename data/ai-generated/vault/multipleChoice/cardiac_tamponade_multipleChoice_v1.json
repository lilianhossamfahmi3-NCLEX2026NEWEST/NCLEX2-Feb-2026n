A pericardial friction rub indicates inflammation (pericarditis), low urine output indicates general shock, and pedal edema indicates chronic heart failure. Only pulsus paradoxus directly reflects the unique pathophysiology of ventricular interdependence and restricted diastolic filling defining cardiac tamponade."

                "content": "Correct. Pulsus paradoxus, an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (>10 mmHg) during inspiration, is a hallmark of cardiac tamponade. This occurs because the pericardial fluid restricts heart expansion. Inspiration increases venous return, enlarging the right ventricle (RV). In tamponade, the RV pushes the interventricular septum leftward, severely compromising left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. This reduces LV preload, stroke volume, and systolic BP, creating pulsus paradoxus. This finding strongly confirms hemodynamic compromise from tamponade."
