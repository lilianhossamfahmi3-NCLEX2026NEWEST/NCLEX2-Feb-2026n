      "content": "Correct. Pulsus paradoxus, an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (>10 mmHg) during inspiration, is a hallmark of cardiac tamponade. Pathophysiology: Pericardial fluid restricts heart expansion. Inspiration increases venous return, enlarging the right ventricle (RV). In tamponade, the RV pushes the interventricular septum leftward, severely compromising left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. This reduces LV preload, stroke volume, and systolic BP, creating pulsus paradoxus. This finding strongly confirms hemodynamic compromise from tamponade.",

In cardiac tamponade, fluid accumulation separates these layers, eliminating a friction rub. The fluid also muffles heart sounds.",
