        "stem": "A patient with an arterial line suddenly exhibits a dampened waveform on the monitor. The nurse assesses the patient and finds the following:\n\n*   **SBAR:**\n    *   **Situation:** Mr. Johnson, a 68-year-old male, admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pneumonia. Arterial line placed in the right radial artery at 0700 today for continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling.\n    *   **Background:** History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. Receiving continuous propofol and fentanyl infusions for sedation and analgesia.\n    *   **Assessment:** At 1330, the arterial waveform became dampened. Current vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22 (ventilator set), SpO2 92%. Patient is slightly restless. No obvious signs of bleeding at the insertion site. The insertion site is patent, without redness, swelling, or drainage. IV fluids infusing at 100 mL/hr.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Evaluate the arterial line patency and troubleshoot the dampened waveform. Consider potential causes and interventions to restore accurate monitoring. Notify the provider if the issue persists after troubleshooting.\n\nWhich of the following actions should the nurse perform FIRST?",
