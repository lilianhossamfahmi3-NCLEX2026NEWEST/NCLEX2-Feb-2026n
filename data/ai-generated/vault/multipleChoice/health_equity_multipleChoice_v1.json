In a 'food desert,' recommending fresh or organic produce (which may be unavailable or unaffordable) is an unrealistic and biased intervention. Collaborating to find nutritious frozen or canned alternatives (which have a longer shelf life and are often more accessible) demonstrates a commitment to culturally and economically appropriate care that increases the likelihood of adherence to the medical plan.",

Recommending premium delivery services or traveling out of town assumes the client has the financial resources or transportation required for these options, which further marginalizes the client. These 'one-size-fits-all' recommendations contribute to health disparities rather than resolving them.",
