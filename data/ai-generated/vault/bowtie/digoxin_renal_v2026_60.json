The failing kidneys (GFR 22 mL/min) are unable to clear digoxin, leading to toxic accumulation (2.4 ng/mL). Concurrently, spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, exacerbates hyperkalemia (5.8 mEq/L) in the setting of renal impairment. This combination poses a significant risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. The nurse must immediately hold both digoxin and spironolactone (a1) to prevent further drug accumulation and potassium elevation. Notifying the provider (a2) is crucial for initiating appropriate medical interventions. Continuous EKG monitoring (p1) is essential to detect digoxin-induced bradycardia and hyperkalemia-related peaked T-waves. Serial monitoring of digoxin, potassium, GFR, and creatinine levels (p2) is also mandatory to assess trends and guide treatment.",
