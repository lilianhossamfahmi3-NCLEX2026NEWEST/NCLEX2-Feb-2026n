The client's renal failure (GFR 22) has led to the accumulation of Digoxin (2.4 ng/mL), while her use of a potassium-sparing diuretic (Spironolactone) in the setting of renal failure has caused hyperkalemia (5.8). This combination is high-risk for lethal arrhythmias. The nurse must hold both drugs (a1) and notify the provider (a2). Monitoring EKG for both digoxin effects (bradycardia) and hyperkalemia effects (peaked T-waves) (p1) plus lab trends (p2) is mandatory.",
