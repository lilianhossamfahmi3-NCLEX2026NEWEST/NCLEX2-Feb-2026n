No apparent injuries reported at the scene. Patient reports feeling dizzy and weak prior to the fall. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and lorazepam for anxiety PRN. \n14:05 - Patient oriented to person, place, and time, but slightly confused. Skin pale and moist. Ambulating to bathroom with assistance. \n14:10 - Vital signs reviewed. Noted a drop in systolic blood pressure from 130 mmHg to 100 mmHg upon standing. Heart rate increased from 80 bpm to 100 bpm. Patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath. \n14:15 - Notified physician of the patient's orthostatic hypotension and recent fall. Orders received and implemented. Continuous monitoring initiated. Family at bedside. Educated patient and family on fall prevention strategies.\n14:20 - Will continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status. Assess patient’s understanding of fall precautions. Encourage patient to call for assistance before ambulating."
