Risk factors include hyponatremia (Na 132 mEq/L) and NSAID use (ibuprofen), both of which decrease renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased serum levels. Priority actions include immediately holding all scheduled doses of lithium (a1) to prevent further accumulation and initiating IV 0.9% normal saline at 150 mL/hr (a2) to promote lithium excretion through the kidneys. Monitoring serial serum lithium and creatinine levels (p1) is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment and renal function. Neurological status and gait stability (p2) should be closely monitored to detect any worsening of neurological symptoms.",
