The client is not breathing and requires immediate intervention.<br><b>Background:</b> The client was admitted two days ago on an involuntary psychiatric hold due to suicidal ideation. There is no medical power of attorney on file. The client has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The client's current Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 5. Vital signs indicate severe distress: BP 72/40, HR 38, RR 4, SpO2 72%. The client is cyanotic, apneic, and requires immediate intubation and ventilation.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Recommend proceeding with stabilization under the doctrine of implied consent due to the emergent, life-threatening nature of the client's condition. Contacting next of kin is in progress."

Even though the client is on a psychiatric hold, the 'Doctrine of Implied Consent' applies when the client is incapacitated and their life/health is in immediate danger. Given the client's GCS score of 5, apnea, and desaturation, the nurse should proceed immediately with emergency care, including intubation and ventilation (a1). It is also crucial to meticulously document the clinical necessity for the intervention as an exception to informed consent (a2). Parameter monitoring should focus on the client's medical stability, specifically the Glasgow Coma Scale and respiratory status (p1), and on documenting ongoing attempts to contact legal next-of-kin to inform them of the situation (p2).",
