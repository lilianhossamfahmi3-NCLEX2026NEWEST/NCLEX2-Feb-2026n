They also receive diuretic therapy. The client has a history of poor dietary intake secondary to alcohol use. <br><b>Assessment:</b> The client's heart rate is 108 and irregular upon auscultation. The client describes 'skipping' sensations in the chest. BP is 102/64 mmHg. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Evaluate serum digoxin and electrolyte levels, particularly magnesium and potassium, to rule out digoxin toxicity potentiated by electrolyte imbalances. Consider continuous cardiac monitoring."

Although the digoxin level (1.9 ng/mL) is within the high-normal therapeutic range (0.5-2.0 ng/mL), the critically low magnesium level (1.1 mEq/L) significantly increases myocardial sensitivity to digoxin's toxic effects, predisposing the client to palpitations and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes. Chronic alcohol use exacerbates hypomagnesemia due to poor intake and increased renal excretion. The nurse should immediately hold digoxin (a1) to prevent further toxicity and administer IV magnesium sulfate as prescribed (a2) to correct the electrolyte imbalance. Continuous cardiac monitoring (p1) is essential to detect and manage arrhythmias, and serial magnesium and digoxin levels (p2) are necessary to assess the effectiveness of treatment and prevent recurrence.",
