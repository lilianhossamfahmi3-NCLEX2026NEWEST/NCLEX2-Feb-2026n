Denies vaginal bleeding or contractions. Fetal movement feels decreased compared to yesterday. 07:15. B: Patient's first pregnancy was uncomplicated, resulting in a full-term vaginal delivery. She has a history of mild hypertension, usually well-controlled with diet. 07:30. A: Currently, assessing the patient's vital signs and fetal heart rate. Will check urine for protein. Preparing for potential magnesium sulfate administration based on preliminary assessment findings. Notified the physician of the patient's condition and awaiting orders. 07:45. R: Recommend immediate evaluation for preeclampsia and potential interventions to prevent complications. Continuous fetal monitoring is crucial. Prepare for possible delivery if the condition worsens. Patient education regarding signs and symptoms to watch for at home is also necessary."
