The hallmark triad includes respiratory distress (SpO2 84%), neurological decline (confusion, agitation), and a petechial rash. The 'snowstorm' infiltrates on the chest x-ray further support this diagnosis. Priority nursing actions include administering high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask (a1) to address the hypoxemia and ensuring strict immobilization of the fractured extremity (a2) to minimize further embolization of fat globules. Monitoring should focus on continuous assessment of respiratory status, including respiratory rate, SpO2, and lung sounds (p1), as well as neurological status and the presence/progression of petechiae (p2).",
