He is now reporting severe pain and numbness in his left hand.<br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The patient sustained a closed supracondylar humerus fracture during a fall. A long arm cast was applied in the operating room following successful reduction. Pain medication (morphine) was administered 30 minutes ago with minimal relief.<br><br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> The patient rates his pain as 10/10 and describes it as a deep, aching pain. He states, 'I can't feel my fingers.' Neurovascular assessment reveals a weak radial pulse, delayed capillary refill (5 seconds), pallor, and pain with passive extension of the fingers. Vitals: BP 112/70, HR 128, RR 24. <br><br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> I am concerned about acute compartment syndrome (Volkmann's ischemia). I recommend immediate orthopedic evaluation, cast bivalving, and pain management reassessment."

This is supported by the severe pain out of proportion to the injury, pain with passive stretch of the fingers, pallor, and sensory loss. The priority actions are to immediately notify the orthopedic surgeon and bivalve the cast (a2) to relieve pressure and position the affected arm at the level of the heart (a1) to maintain arterial perfusion.
