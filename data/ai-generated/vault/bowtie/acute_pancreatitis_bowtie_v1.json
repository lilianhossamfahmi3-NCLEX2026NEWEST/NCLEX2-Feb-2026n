        "correct": "The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstone obstruction (c1) and chronic alcohol abuse (c2). Gallstones can block the pancreatic duct, leading to enzyme backup and autodigestion. Chronic alcohol abuse causes pancreatic inflammation and damage over time. Maintaining NPO status (a1) is crucial to reduce pancreatic stimulation and allow it to rest. IV opioid analgesics (a2) are essential for managing the severe pain associated with acute pancreatitis. Monitoring serum amylase and lipase (p1) helps assess the extent of pancreatic damage, as these enzymes are released into the bloodstream during inflammation. Assessing pain level and location (p2) provides valuable information about the patient's response to treatment and potential complications.",
        "incorrect": "High-fat diet (c4) and viral hepatitis (c3) are less common causes of acute pancreatitis. Administering pancreatic enzymes with meals (a3) is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis, as it further stimulates the pancreas. A clear liquid diet (a4) is not appropriate in the acute phase, as the patient needs complete bowel rest. While bowel sounds (p4) are important to assess, they are not the primary indicators of pancreatic function. Blood glucose (p3) can be affected by pancreatitis, but it is not as specific as amylase and lipase for monitoring the acute phase.",
