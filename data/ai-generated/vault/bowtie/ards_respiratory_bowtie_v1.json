    "correct": "ARDS is characterized by acute, widespread inflammation in the lungs, leading to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. This results in protein-rich fluid leaking into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange, ultimately leading to refractory hypoxemia.  PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) is crucial in ARDS management as it helps to keep alveoli open at the end of expiration, preventing alveolar collapse and improving oxygenation. Prone positioning improves ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching by redistributing lung perfusion to more well-ventilated areas. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is the gold standard for assessing the severity of ARDS, reflecting the efficiency of oxygen transfer in the lungs.  Sedation facilitates mechanical ventilation and reduces oxygen consumption.",
    "incorrect": "Maintaining a high-volume fluid resuscitation strategy can worsen pulmonary edema in ARDS by increasing hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, exacerbating fluid leakage into the alveoli. A conservative fluid strategy is generally preferred. Thoracentesis is indicated for pleural effusions, not the diffuse parenchymal edema characteristic of ARDS. Serum albumin levels may be monitored for nutritional status but are not a primary indicator of ARDS severity or response to treatment. Bowel sounds are not directly relevant to the respiratory distress in ARDS.",

      "Early recognition of ARDS is crucial for improving patient outcomes.  Monitor for signs of increasing respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, and cyanosis.  Implement lung-protective ventilation strategies, including low tidal volumes and PEEP, to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury.",
