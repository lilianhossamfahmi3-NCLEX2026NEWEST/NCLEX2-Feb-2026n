Currently receiving magnesium sulfate at 2 grams/hour. 1415: Noted patient is increasingly somnolent, difficult to arouse. Respiratory rate decreased from 16 to 10 breaths/min. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished (+1). 1420: Patient reports feeling flushed and warm. 1430: Urine output over the last hour was 20 mL. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows a baseline of 140 bpm with moderate variability. 1445: Called MD, awaiting orders. Will continue close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status. Patient education regarding potential medication side effects provided prior to current decline in status. Family at bedside is anxious about the patient's condition. Will continue to update them on any changes. Magnesium sulfate infusion per protocol."
