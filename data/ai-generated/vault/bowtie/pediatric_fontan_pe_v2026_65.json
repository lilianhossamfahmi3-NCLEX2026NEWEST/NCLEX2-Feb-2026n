    "correct": "This is a Pulmonary Embolism (c1) in a high-risk pediatric cardiac patient. Post-Fontan physiology relies on passive (low-pressure) pulmonary blood flow; any clot in the lungs causes immediate backup into the systemic venous system (High Fontan pressure/Enlarged liver) and severe hypoxia. Priority actions are stopping clot growth with Heparin (a1) and optimizing ventilation via HOB elevation (a2). Monitoring focus is on oxygenation (p1) and bleeding risks from the new anticoagulation (p2).",
