Post-Fontan physiology relies on passive (low-pressure) pulmonary blood flow; any clot in the lungs causes immediate backup into the systemic venous system (High Fontan pressure/Enlarged liver) and severe hypoxia. The sudden bloody chest tube drainage and elevated D-dimer further support this diagnosis. Priority actions are stopping clot growth with Heparin or Enoxaparin as prescribed (a1) and optimizing ventilation via HOB elevation (a2) to reduce preload. Monitoring focus is on oxygenation (p1) and bleeding risks from the new anticoagulation (p2).",
