    "correct": "FES is caused by the release of fat globules from the bone marrow (c1) into the circulation following a long bone fracture. These fat globules trigger an inflammatory cascade, leading to free fatty acid-induced lung injury (c2) and subsequent ARDS. The primary management focuses on supportive care. Administer high-flow oxygen (a1) to address hypoxemia resulting from impaired gas exchange in the lungs. Initiate IV fluid resuscitation (a2) to maintain adequate circulating volume and blood pressure, counteracting potential hypovolemia from increased capillary permeability and fluid shifts. Closely monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2) (p1) to assess the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and detect any further respiratory compromise. Assess mental status using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (p2) to identify changes in neurological function due to hypoxemia or cerebral edema.",
    "incorrect": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (c3) and hypovolemic shock (c4) are not primary causes of FES, although hypovolemia can be a secondary complication. Administering heparin IV (a3) is contraindicated in FES as it is an anticoagulant and will not dissolve fat emboli; it may also increase the risk of bleeding. Preparing for immediate fasciotomy (a4) is indicated for compartment syndrome, not FES. Monitoring skin integrity (rash) (p3) is relevant for identifying the petechial rash characteristic of FES, but SpO2 and GCS are more critical for assessing respiratory and neurological status. Neurovascular checks of the foot (p4) are important for assessing compartment syndrome or vascular injury in the affected limb, but are not directly related to the systemic effects of FES.",
