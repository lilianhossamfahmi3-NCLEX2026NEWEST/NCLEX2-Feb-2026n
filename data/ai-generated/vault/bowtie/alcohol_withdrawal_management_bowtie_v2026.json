Cues include tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, tremors, and hallucinations. Priority nursing actions include administering benzodiazepines (lorazepam) to prevent progression to Delirium Tremens and providing a low-stimulation but well-lit environment (to minimize visual misinterpretations). Monitoring the CIWA-Ar score and vital signs are the standard parameters for titrating therapy and detecting autonomic hyperactivity.",
