    "correct": "The patient is experiencing an Inferior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), confirmed by the 3mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF and elevated troponin. The priority actions are to inhibit further clot formation (chewing 325mg aspirin for rapid absorption) and to restore coronary perfusion immediately (preparing for the Cath Lab/PCI). Monitoring ST-segment changes provides real-time data on the progress of the infarction or the effectiveness of reperfusion, while oxygen saturation is critical to ensure the heart muscle receives maximal oxygen during the crisis.",
    "incorrect": "Ambulation is contraindicated as it increases myocardial oxygen demand during an MI. Sodium restriction is the norm for cardiac patients, not a high-sodium diet.
