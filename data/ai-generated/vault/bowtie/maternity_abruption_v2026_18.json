She arrived at the triage unit.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:30, the client reports sudden onset of constant, 'tearing' abdominal pain, rated 10/10. A small amount of dark red vaginal bleeding is noted. Uterine tone is board-like and tense, with no relaxation between contractions. Fetal heart rate (FHR) is 105 bpm with absent variability and recurrent late decelerations. Maternal vital signs: BP 158/104, HR 122, RR 26, SpO2 96% on room air.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Request immediate surgical and neonatal team standby. Initiate continuous fetal monitoring and prepare for emergent Cesarean section. Establish large-bore IV access and anticipate fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion if needed."

Risk factors include hypertension and tobacco use. The priority nursing actions are to prepare the client for an emergent Cesarean section (a1) to deliver the fetus quickly and establish large-bore IV access for aggressive fluid resuscitation (a2) to manage maternal blood loss and prevent hypovolemic shock. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring (p1) is crucial to assess fetal well-being, and monitoring for signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (p2), such as oozing from IV sites, is essential because abruption can trigger DIC due to the release of thromboplastin into the maternal circulation.",
