Wife found him unresponsive after ingesting an unknown quantity of acetaminophen and alcohol. \nBackground: Pt has a history of depression, diagnosed 3 years ago, currently managed with sertraline 100mg daily. Pt reports increased stress due to job loss 2 weeks ago and marital discord. No prior suicide attempts. \nAssessment: Pt is currently conscious but drowsy, oriented to person only. Speech is slurred. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 90/60, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. GCS 14. Pupils are equal and reactive. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. \nRecommendation: Requesting immediate psychiatric evaluation and medical clearance. Consider gastric lavage or activated charcoal administration. Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent vital sign checks are warranted. Secure belongings and initiate suicide precautions per hospital protocol. Consult social work for family support and crisis intervention."
