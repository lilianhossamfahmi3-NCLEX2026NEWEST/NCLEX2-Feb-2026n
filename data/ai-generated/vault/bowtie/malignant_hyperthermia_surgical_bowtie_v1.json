    "correct": "Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) is a rare, life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis triggered by certain anesthetic agents, particularly volatile inhaled anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, isoflurane) and the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine. The genetic predisposition involves mutations in genes encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), which regulates calcium release in skeletal muscle. When exposed to triggering agents, uncontrolled calcium release leads to sustained muscle contraction, rigidity (often starting with the jaw), and a dramatic increase in metabolism. This hypermetabolic state results in increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production (leading to a rapid rise in ETCO2), and heat generation, causing a rapid rise in body temperature. Tachycardia is also present due to the increased metabolic demand. The priority is to immediately discontinue the triggering agents and administer dantrolene sodium, a muscle relaxant that inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Hyperventilation with 100% oxygen helps to eliminate accumulated CO2. Monitoring temperature and ETCO2 is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment.",
    "incorrect": "Atropine is an anticholinergic medication used to treat bradycardia and reduce secretions; it is not indicated in MH and will not address the underlying pathophysiology. Applying external heat is contraindicated as it will exacerbate the hyperthermia. While thyroid storm, NMS, and serotonin syndrome can present with elevated temperature, the rapid rise in ETCO2 and jaw rigidity are more specific to MH. Urine protein and blood glucose are not primary indicators for MH. Serum Creatine Kinase (CK) and Urine Myoglobin are important to monitor for Rhabdomyolysis, a complication of MH, but are not the initial parameters to monitor.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Early signs of MH can be subtle, such as unexplained tachycardia, tachypnea, or increased ETCO2. Prompt recognition and intervention are critical to prevent severe complications. Always inquire about a family history of adverse reactions to anesthesia. Consider using non-triggering anesthetic agents in patients with a known or suspected susceptibility to MH. The Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) provides valuable resources and support for healthcare professionals and patients."
