He has an indwelling Foley catheter.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the client reported a severe headache and visible flushing above the chest. Current BP is 198/112 mmHg, and HR is 48 bpm. Profuse sweating and goosebumps are noted on the legs (below the level of injury).<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Immediately elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees. Quickly assess for and remove any potential triggering stimuli, such as bladder distension or bowel impaction. Prepare to administer antihypertensive medication if the blood pressure remains elevated after addressing potential triggers. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial."

        "correct": "The client is most likely experiencing Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) (c1), a potentially life-threatening complication in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. AD is triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of the injury, such as a kinked Foley catheter, leading to an exaggerated sympathetic response. This results in severe hypertension, bradycardia, and flushing above the level of the injury due to vasodilation, with pallor and goosebumps below due to vasoconstriction. Elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees (a1) helps lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Identifying and removing the triggering stimulus (a2) is crucial to resolving the episode. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate (p1) is essential to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any further changes. Assessing urinary drainage system patency and bowel status (p2) helps identify and address common triggers.",
