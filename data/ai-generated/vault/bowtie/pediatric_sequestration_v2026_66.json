A large volume of the child's blood becomes 'trapped' in the spleen, leading to a sudden drop in Hgb (from 8.4 to 3.8) and hypovolemic shock (BP 62/34). The elevated reticulocyte count (18%) indicates the bone marrow is attempting to compensate for the sudden anemia. Priority actions are immediate fluid and blood volume replacement (a1) to address hypovolemic shock and tracking the splenomegaly via abdominal girth measurements and gentle palpation (a2). Key parameters include monitoring Hgb levels and abdominal girth (p1) to assess the effectiveness of treatment and signs of shock perfusion (p2).",
