Dressing is dry and intact. \n1415: Contacted orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Smith, regarding client's pain and neurovascular findings. New orders received (see care plan). \n1430: Initiated interventions per Dr. Smith's orders. Elevating leg and applying ice pack. Closely monitoring neurovascular status of affected extremity. Educated client on importance of reporting any changes in sensation, pain, or movement. Will continue to assess and document client's response to interventions. \n1500: Pain remains unchanged. Called Dr. Smith to report interventions ineffective. Waiting for further orders."
