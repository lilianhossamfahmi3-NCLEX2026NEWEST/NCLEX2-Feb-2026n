    "correct": "This is Rhabdomyolysis leading to Acute Tubular Necrosis (c2). When muscle is crushed or dies (as in compartment syndrome), it releases Myoglobin. Myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules. The high CK (84,000) and tea-colored urine confirm this. Priority #1 is aggressive hydration (a1) to 'flush' the pigment through the kidneys. Priority #2 is managing the Potassium (a2), as muscle cell death (lysis) releases massive amounts into the blood. Monitoring must track the 'Pigment' (p1) and the 'Electrolytes' (p2).",
