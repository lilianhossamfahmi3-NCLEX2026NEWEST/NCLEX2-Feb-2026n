The patient underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. <b>Background:</b> The patient was pinned under a wall for 6 hours, resulting in significant lower leg trauma. The fasciotomy was performed to relieve pressure and restore circulation. <b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the urine in the collection bag is dark tea-colored, and the patient reports generalized muscle pain. Creatine Kinase (CK) is markedly elevated at 84,000 U/L, and urine myoglobin is positive for a large amount. Serum potassium is elevated at 6.2 mEq/L. Urine output is low, at 10 mL/hr. <b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate stat CK and implement alkaline diuresis to protect renal function. Monitor cardiac rhythm for hyperkalemia."

        "correct": "The client is experiencing Rhabdomyolysis leading to Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) (c2). When muscle tissue is crushed or dies (as in compartment syndrome), it releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules, causing damage and potentially leading to kidney failure. The markedly elevated CK (84,000 U/L) and dark tea-colored urine confirm the diagnosis. The priority nursing actions are aggressive hydration (a1) with high-volume IV Normal Saline to 'flush' the myoglobin pigment through the kidneys and prevent further damage. Additionally, it is crucial to monitor for and manage hyperkalemia (a2), as muscle cell death (lysis) releases large amounts of potassium into the blood. Monitoring should include tracking urine color and hourly urine output (p1) to assess the effectiveness of hydration and renal function, as well as monitoring serum Creatine Kinase (CK) and Potassium (K+) levels (p2) to evaluate the extent of muscle damage and electrolyte imbalances.",

            "The goal in rhabdomyolysis is to maintain a urine output of at least 200–300 mL/hr to prevent kidney damage.",
            "Creatine Kinase (CK) level is the most sensitive lab indicator of rhabdomyolysis, with levels often exceeding 5,000 U/L.",
            "If the urine doesn't clear despite aggressive hydration, the patient will likely need emergent hemodialysis to remove myoglobin and prevent permanent kidney damage."

Aggressive fluid administration is essential to prevent the 'sludge' (myoglobin) from plugging the kidneys and causing permanent damage. Think of it as needing to 'wash out' the kidneys."
