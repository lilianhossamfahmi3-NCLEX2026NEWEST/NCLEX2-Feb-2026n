Mom reports he's been healthy, eating well, and has no fever. \n\nBackground: Leo was born full-term with no complications. His birth weight was 7 lbs 8 oz. He received his HepB vaccine at birth. Family history is unremarkable for autoimmune diseases or vaccine reactions. \n\nAssessment: On exam, Leo is alert and active. Weight is 11 lbs 2 oz, length is 22 inches, and head circumference is 39 cm. Vital signs are stable. No signs of illness. \n\nRecommendation: Administer scheduled 2-month vaccines: DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV13, and RV. Provide education to the mother on potential side effects and when to seek medical attention. Document vaccine administration in the EHR. Review immunization schedule for next visit. Ensure mom understands importance of completing the series."
