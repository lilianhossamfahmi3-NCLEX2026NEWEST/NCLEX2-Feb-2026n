Temperature is 38.9°C. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. \n\n07:15 Physician orders received for oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula and sputum culture. \n\n07:30 Patient reports chills and muscle aches. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in the right lower lobe. Patient is alert and oriented but appears fatigued. Currently awaiting respiratory therapy assessment and sputum culture results. Will continue to monitor vital signs and respiratory status. \n\n07:45 Patient SpO2 increased to 92% on 2L NC. Encouraging patient to cough and deep breathe. Will educate on proper PPE prior to collection of sputum sample. \n\n08:00 Preparing to collect sputum sample per order."

Hand hygiene is always the first step. A gown is required to protect the nurse from potential contact with infectious material.
