ACS is characterized by a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, or hypoxemia. The client's sudden drop in SpO2 to 86%, new fever of 102.1°F (38.9°C), pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates are classic indicators of ACS. Priority nursing actions include intensive pulmonary hygiene with incentive spirometry (a1) to prevent further lung collapse and sickling in the pulmonary capillaries, and administering IV antibiotics and oxygen as prescribed (a2) to treat potential infection and improve oxygenation. Key parameters to monitor are respiratory rate and continuous pulse oximetry (p1) to assess respiratory stability, and breath sounds and presence of pleuritic chest pain (p2) to evaluate lung function and pain levels.",
