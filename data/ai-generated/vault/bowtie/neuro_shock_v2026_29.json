The client's skin is warm, pink, and dry below the level of injury. Urine output is 15 mL/hr. The client is increasingly lethargic.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate aggressive hemodynamic support, including IV fluids and vasopressors, as prescribed.

This leads to massive vasodilation, causing hypotension and bradycardia. The warm, dry skin is a key characteristic differentiating it from hypovolemic shock. Administering IV fluids helps to increase preload and improve blood pressure. Vasopressors are used to constrict blood vessels, further increasing blood pressure. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and to detect any further deterioration.",
