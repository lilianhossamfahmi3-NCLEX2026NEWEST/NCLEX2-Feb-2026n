Initial pain was managed with analgesics, but the client now reports a pain level of 10/10, unrelieved by Fentanyl. <br><b>Assessment:</b> The right lower leg is tense and tight to palpation.

The priority is preparing the client for an emergent fasciotomy (a1) to release the pressure and prevent muscle necrosis. Elevating the extremity to heart level (a2) helps optimize arterial inflow while minimizing venous congestion. Monitoring should focus on trends in intracompartmental pressure and Delta Pressure (p1), as well as the classic clinical signs known as the 6 Ps (p2).",
