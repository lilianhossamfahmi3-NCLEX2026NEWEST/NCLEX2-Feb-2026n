Once in the left side of the heart, it enters the systemic arterial circulation and can travel to the brain (Stroke). The 'Bubble Study' (showing bubbles crossing sides) confirms the shunt. Priority actions involve managing the stroke (a1) and preventing more clots with Heparin (a2). Monitoring focuses on neuro-recovery (p1) and pulmonary stability (p2).",
