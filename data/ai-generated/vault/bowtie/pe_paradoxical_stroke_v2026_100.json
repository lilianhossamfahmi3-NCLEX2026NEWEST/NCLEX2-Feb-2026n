The patient's congenital PFO was previously diagnosed. <br><b>Assessment:</b> Initial NIHSS score is 12, demonstrating moderate neurological deficit. The patient exhibits left facial droop and hemiparesis. Oxygen saturation is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Prepare the patient for a bubble echo to confirm right-to-left shunt. Consult neurology for emergent stroke management, including potential thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status."

In a patient with a patent foramen ovale (PFO), a venous clot (DVT) can bypass the pulmonary circulation by crossing from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the left side of the heart, it enters the systemic arterial circulation and can travel to the brain, causing a stroke. The 'Bubble Study' confirms the right-to-left shunt. Priority actions involve managing the acute ischemic stroke (a1) and preventing further embolization with anticoagulation (a2). Monitoring focuses on neurological recovery (p1) and respiratory stability (p2).",
