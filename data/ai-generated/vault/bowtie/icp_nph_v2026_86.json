He lives at home with his daughter, who reports the changes. <br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the client exhibits a wide-based gait, described as a 'magnet gait,' where he appears to have difficulty lifting his feet. Cognitively, he demonstrates mild memory loss and slowed thinking. The daughter also reports recent onset of urinary incontinence, occurring primarily at night. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> The neurology team recommends a large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) to assess for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). Monitor gait, cognition, and continence before and after the LP."

A large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) is often performed to assess if CSF drainage improves symptoms, which would indicate that a shunt may be beneficial. Assessing gait and continence before and after the LP (a1) helps determine the effectiveness of CSF drainage. Fall precautions (a2) are crucial due to the gait instability. Monitoring gait stability and urinary continence (p1) and cognitive function (p2) are essential to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
