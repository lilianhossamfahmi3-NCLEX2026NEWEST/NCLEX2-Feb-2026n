A large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) is often performed to assess if CSF drainage improves symptoms, which would indicate that a shunt may be beneficial. Assessing gait and continence before and after the LP (a1) helps determine the effectiveness of CSF drainage. Fall precautions (a2) are crucial due to the gait instability. Monitoring gait stability and urinary continence (p1) and cognitive function (p2) are essential to evaluate treatment effectiveness.",
