    "correct": "The patient presents with classic signs of urosepsis: new-onset confusion (especially common in elderly patients with UTIs), fever, elevated WBC count, and hypotension.  Urosepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by a urinary tract infection. The priority is to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy as quickly as possible to prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. Obtaining blood and urine cultures before starting antibiotics is crucial for guiding antibiotic selection. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour is a key component of sepsis management to improve patient outcomes. Monitoring MAP and mental status are essential for assessing perfusion and neurological function, which are often compromised in sepsis. A MAP >65 mmHg is generally targeted to ensure adequate organ perfusion. Changes in GCS and orientation can indicate worsening cerebral hypoperfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Continuous bladder irrigation is indicated for hematuria or bladder obstruction, not for sepsis management. Placing the patient in a cooling blanket is generally avoided in sepsis unless the fever is dangerously high (e.g., >40°C or 104°F) because it can induce shivering, which increases metabolic demand and oxygen consumption, potentially worsening the patient's condition.  The body's natural response to infection is to increase the core temperature to fight off the infection. Artificially lowering the temperature can interfere with this process and potentially worsen outcomes.",
