It is a rare, usually fatal complication occurring 1-2 weeks post-transfusion when donor T-lymphocytes attack the immunocompromised host's tissues (skin, liver, bone marrow). The hallmark signs are a rash, liver failure, and severe marrow suppression (pancytopenia). Priority actions: Ensure all future products are irradiated (a1) to kill donor WBCs and support the patient with aggressive therapy (a2). Key parameters: Bone marrow function (p1) and liver function (p2).",
