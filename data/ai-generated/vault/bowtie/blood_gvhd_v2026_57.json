TA-GVHD is a rare but severe complication that occurs when donor T-lymphocytes attack the immunocompromised host's tissues, particularly the skin, liver, and bone marrow. This typically manifests 1-2 weeks post-transfusion. The hallmark signs include a diffuse maculopapular rash, elevated liver enzymes leading to jaundice, and severe bone marrow suppression (pancytopenia). The priority nursing actions are to ensure all future blood products are irradiated (a1) to neutralize donor lymphocytes and to administer immunosuppressants and supportive fluid therapy (a2) to mitigate the immune response and manage symptoms. Key parameters to monitor include serial CBC with differential (p1) to assess bone marrow function and liver function tests and bilirubin levels (p2) to evaluate liver involvement.",
