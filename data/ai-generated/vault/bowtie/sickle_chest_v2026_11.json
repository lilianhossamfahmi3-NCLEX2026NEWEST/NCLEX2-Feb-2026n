The client is now reporting new onset of chest pain and a cough.\n<br>\n<b>Background:</b> The client has a history of multiple vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization. Current orders include IV fluids and morphine for pain management.\n<br>\n<b>Assessment:</b> At 12:00, the client's vital signs are: BP 102/60 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 26 breaths/min, SpO2 89% on room air (previously 97%). Auscultation reveals right lower lobe crackles and decreased breath sounds. The client's temperature is 102.1°F (38.9°C). The client describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the chest.\n<br>\n<b>Recommendation:</b> The provider should immediately evaluate the client for Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) and consider ordering a chest X-ray to rule out pulmonary infiltrates or infarction. Increase supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 >94%."

        "correct": "Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) (c2) is a life-threatening complication of SCD characterized by a new pulmonary infiltrate on X-ray, chest pain, fever, cough, and respiratory distress. The vaso-occlusion and inflammation in the pulmonary vasculature lead to impaired gas exchange and hypoxia. Priority actions are to support oxygenation (a1) by administering humidified oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 94% and prevent further atelectasis/infarction through incentive spirometry (a2). Continuous pulse oximetry (p1) is essential to monitor the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and detect any further decline in oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray findings (p2) are crucial for confirming the presence of pulmonary infiltrates, which are a hallmark of ACS.",
