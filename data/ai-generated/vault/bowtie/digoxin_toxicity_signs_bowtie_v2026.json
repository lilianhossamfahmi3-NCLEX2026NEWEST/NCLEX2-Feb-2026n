Waiting on lab results. 08:00: Patient denies chest pain but states they feel like their heart is 'skipping beats'. Encouraged patient to remain in bed. Placed call light within reach. 08:15: Serum digoxin level results received. Dr. Smith notified. Orders received to hold digoxin and administer potassium supplement. 08:30: Potassium supplement administered per order. Monitoring vital signs and cardiac rhythm closely. Patient reports slight improvement in nausea. 08:45: Continue to monitor patient's condition and response to treatment. Documented findings in EHR."
