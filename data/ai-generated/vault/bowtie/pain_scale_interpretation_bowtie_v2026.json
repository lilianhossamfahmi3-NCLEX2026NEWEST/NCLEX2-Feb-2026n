Denies any previous back issues. O: Patient is alert and oriented x3. Ambulating with a slight limp. Facial grimacing noted with movement. Vitals stable. A: Acute lower back pain, likely musculoskeletal in origin. Rule out nerve impingement. P: Administered ibuprofen 400mg PO. Encouraged to use heat pack. Educated on proper body mechanics and stretching exercises. Will reassess pain level in 1 hour. 10/26 08:00. Patient reports pain level decreased to 5/10 after ibuprofen administration. Continues to use heat pack. Encouraged to continue prescribed regimen."
