Pain management includes IV morphine administered per protocol.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the client reports persistent, excruciating pain rated 10/10 despite morphine administration. Neurovascular assessment reveals pain with passive extension of toes, paresthesia in the toes, tense and shiny skin around the cast. Pulses are 2+ and present. Vital signs are stable. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Request immediate orthopedic surgical consult for evaluation of acute compartment syndrome and possible fasciotomy."

The hallmark sign is pain out of proportion to the injury, especially with passive motion. The 'pins and needles' sensation (paresthesia), tense/shiny skin, and a normal pulse are also consistent with this condition. The priority nursing actions are to alleviate external pressure by loosening or cutting the cast (a1) to improve circulation and maintaining the affected limb at the level of the heart (a2) to optimize arterial perfusion. Elevating the limb (a3) would further compromise arterial blood flow. Monitoring neurovascular status using the 6 Ps (p1) and assessing intracompartmental pressures (p2) are crucial for evaluating the severity and progression of the syndrome.",
