Unlike younger patients who present with agitation and 'fire,' elderly patients often show 'apathy'—meaning they are lethargic, depressed-looking, and physically weak. However, the thyroid labs (TSH <0.01) and heart rhythm (AFib/Tachycardia) confirm a hypermetabolic crisis. Priority actions involve managing the heart with beta-blockers (a1) and continuous EKG monitoring (a2). Key parameters: Cardiac stability (p1) and monitoring for further mental decline (p2).",
