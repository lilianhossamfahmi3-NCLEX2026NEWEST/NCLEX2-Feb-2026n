Vitals: BP 158/92, HR 138, RR 24, T 100.2°F, SpO2 94%.<br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The patient has a history of Graves' disease diagnosed 20 years ago but has had lapsed follow-up care. She has experienced a 10 lb weight loss over the past two weeks.<br><br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> The patient is slumped in her chair, appearing weak and apathetic. Mental status assessment reveals dull affect and signs of depression. Cardiac monitoring shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) at a rate of 138 bpm. Serum TSH is critically low at <0.01, indicative of extreme hyperthyroidism.<br><br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring. Administer IV Propranolol to control heart rate. Monitor level of consciousness and oral intake. Obtain immediate thyroid panel. Consider geriatric apathetic thyroid storm."
