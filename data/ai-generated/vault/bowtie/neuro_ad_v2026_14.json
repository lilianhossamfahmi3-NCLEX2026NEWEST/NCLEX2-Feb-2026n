The trigger (kinked catheter/distended bladder) sends a message that causes mass sympathetic discharge (Hypertension), while the brain attempts to compensate with parasympathetic signals (flushing, sweating, bradycardia). The priority is to lower BP by sitting the client up (a1) and removing the noxious stimulus (a2). Monitoring BP (p1) and HR (p2) is essential since severe HTN can lead to seizure or stroke.",
