The client reports a severe, throbbing headache and blurred vision. Initial blood pressure is 210/115 mmHg, and heart rate is 52 bpm. The client appears anxious and restless.<br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The client sustained a complete T4 SCI three years ago and is currently admitted to the rehabilitation unit for routine follow-up and therapy. The client has an indwelling urinary catheter.<br><br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> The client's skin is flushed and diaphoretic above the T4 level, while the skin below is cool and pale. A distended bladder is noted upon palpation. The urinary catheter was found kinked at 14:15 and has been resolved.<br><br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> Immediately assess for any other potential noxious stimuli, elevate the head of the bed, and closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Consider pharmacological intervention if blood pressure remains elevated after addressing potential triggers."

        "correct": "Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) (c2) is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. It is triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of the injury. In this case, the kinked urinary catheter and subsequent bladder distention send signals that the body cannot regulate due to the SCI. This results in a massive sympathetic nervous system discharge, leading to severe hypertension. The brain attempts to compensate via the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in bradycardia, flushing, and sweating above the level of injury. The priority is to reduce blood pressure by elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees (a1) to promote orthostatic hypotension and to identify and remove the noxious stimulus, such as checking for catheter kinks or bladder distention (a2). Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (p1) and heart rate (p2) is crucial, as uncontrolled hypertension can lead to stroke, seizure, or death.",
