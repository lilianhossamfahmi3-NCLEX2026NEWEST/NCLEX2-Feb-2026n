The client was admitted for observation after an episode of dizziness.\n<b>Assessment:</b> Current vital signs show a heart rate of 52 bpm, indicating bradycardia. Serum potassium is low at 2.9 mEq/L, and Digoxin level is 1.8 ng/mL. Cardiac rhythm shows sinus bradycardia with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).\n<b>Recommendation:</b> Given the client's symptoms, bradycardia, hypokalemia, and Digoxin level, I recommend holding the next dose of Digoxin, administering potassium chloride as prescribed, and closely monitoring cardiac rhythm and potassium levels. Further evaluation for Digoxin toxicity is warranted."

        "correct": "The client is experiencing Digoxin toxicity due to hypokalemia (K+ 2.9 mEq/L), despite a Digoxin level of 1.8 ng/mL, which is within the therapeutic range. Hypokalemia increases the sensitivity of myocardial cells to Digoxin, predisposing the client to toxicity (c2). The priority nursing actions are to hold the scheduled dose of Digoxin (a1) to prevent further accumulation and administer potassium chloride (KCl) intravenously as prescribed (a2) to correct the electrolyte imbalance. Continuous cardiac telemetry (p1) is essential to monitor for arrhythmias, and frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels (p2) is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of potassium replacement therapy and prevent hyperkalemia.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "Digoxin and Potassium compete for binding sites on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in myocardial cells. When potassium levels are low, Digoxin binds more readily, increasing its effect and risk of toxicity.",

            "The therapeutic range for Digoxin is typically 0.5–2.0 ng/mL, but toxicity can occur within this range in the presence of electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia.",
            "Early signs of Digoxin toxicity include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. Bradycardia and new arrhythmias are also common."

Electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia, can significantly increase the risk of toxicity even when Digoxin levels appear to be within the therapeutic range.
