Symptoms include extreme fever (105.2°F/40.7°C), severe tachycardia (162 bpm) with atrial fibrillation, and delirium. The priority is to rapidly reduce the temperature (a1) using cooling blankets and ice packs, and to control the heart rate and sympathetic surge with beta-blockers like propranolol (a2). Continuous monitoring of core temperature (p1) and cardiac rhythm (p2) is critical to detect complications such as heart failure or cardiac arrest. The undetectable TSH and elevated T3/T4 confirm thyrotoxicosis.",
