        "correct": "Epiglottitis is a medical emergency characterized by rapid inflammation of the epiglottis, potentially leading to airway obstruction. The classic presentation includes the 'tripod' position, drooling, dysphagia, distress, and a muffled voice. The priority is securing the airway through emergent intubation or tracheostomy. IV antibiotics are crucial to treat the underlying bacterial infection, commonly Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Fluids are administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. Monitoring respiratory effort, stridor, heart rate, and oxygen saturation are essential to assess the patient's condition and response to treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Examining the throat with a tongue depressor or obtaining an oropharyngeal culture is contraindicated in suspected epiglottitis.
