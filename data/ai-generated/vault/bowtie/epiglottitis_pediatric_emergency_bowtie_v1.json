    "correct": "Epiglottitis is a medical emergency characterized by rapid inflammation of the epiglottis, potentially leading to airway obstruction. The classic presentation includes the 'tripod' position, drooling, dysphagia, distress, and a muffled voice.  The priority is securing the airway through emergent intubation or tracheostomy. IV antibiotics are crucial to treat the underlying bacterial infection, commonly Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Fluids are administered to maintain hydration and support circulation.",
    "incorrect": "Performing a physical exam of the throat with a tongue depressor or obtaining an oropharyngeal culture is contraindicated in suspected epiglottitis.
