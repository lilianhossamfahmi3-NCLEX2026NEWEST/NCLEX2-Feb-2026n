She initially presented with fever and flank pain three days ago. Urine cultures confirmed a gram-negative infection.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the patient's blood pressure is 88/42 mmHg, heart rate is 122 bpm, respiratory rate is 26 breaths/min, and temperature is 39.6°C (103.2°F). The patient is confused and disoriented. Skin is warm, flushed, and dry. Urine output has decreased to 18 mL in the last 2 hours. Lactate level is 4.8 mmol/L.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate sepsis protocol. Obtain blood cultures immediately. Administer a 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus. Monitor MAP and lactate levels closely."

The elevated lactate level (4.8 mmol/L) confirms inadequate tissue perfusion despite increased cardiac output (hyperdynamic state). Priority nursing actions include obtaining blood cultures before administering antibiotics (a1) to identify the causative organism and initiating aggressive fluid resuscitation with a 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus (a2) to address vasodilation and improve tissue perfusion. Monitoring Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) (p1) and serum lactate levels (p2) are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of interventions and guiding further treatment. MAP reflects tissue perfusion pressure, and lactate clearance indicates improved oxygen delivery.",
