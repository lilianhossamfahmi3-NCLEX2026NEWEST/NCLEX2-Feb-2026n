    "correct": "This is malignant hyperthermia (c2). While thyroid storm (c1) is a valid concern in this patient, the extreme end-tidal CO2 (82 mmHg) and 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity (specifically lockjaw) are the hallmarks of MH, triggered by succinylcholine or volatile gases. Priority #1 is the specific antidote, dantrolene (a1), and Priority #2 is rapid cooling (a2). Key parameters include tracking the CO2 (the earliest sign) (p1) and monitoring for rhabdomyolysis/potassium spikes related to the rigidity (p2).",

      "The earliest sign of MH is a sudden rise in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), NOT the fever.",
