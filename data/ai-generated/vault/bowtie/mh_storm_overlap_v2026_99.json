While Thyroid Storm (c1) is a valid concern in this patient, the extreme End-Tidal CO2 (82 mmHg) and 'Lead-pipe' muscle rigidity (specifically lockjaw) are the hallmarks of MH, triggered by Succinylcholine or volatile gases. Priority #1 is the specific antidote, Dantrolene (a1), and Priority #2 is rapid cooling (a2). Key parameters include tracking the CO2 (the earliest sign) (p1) and monitoring for rhabdomyolysis/potassium spikes related to the rigidity (p2).",
