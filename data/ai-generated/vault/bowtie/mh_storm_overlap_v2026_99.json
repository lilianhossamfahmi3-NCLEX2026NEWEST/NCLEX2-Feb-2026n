She is now in the PACU and exhibiting signs of a hyperthermic crisis. Her core temperature is 105.1°F.<br><b>Background:</b> The client has a history of hyperthyroidism. Intraoperatively, she received succinylcholine and isoflurane.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 11:15, the client's jaw was noted to be locked (masseter spasm), and her skin is mottled. Heart rate is 158 bpm, and end-tidal CO2 is elevated at 82 mmHg. Muscle tone is rigid.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> I recommend immediate stabilization and evaluation for possible malignant hyperthermia versus thyroid storm. We need to administer dantrolene and initiate cooling measures STAT."

        "correct": "This is malignant hyperthermia (MH) (c2). While thyroid storm (c1) is a valid concern given the patient's history, the extreme end-tidal CO2 (82 mmHg), elevated CK (12,000 U/L), and 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity (specifically lockjaw/masseter spasm) are hallmarks of MH, triggered by succinylcholine or volatile anesthetic gases. Priority #1 is the specific antidote, dantrolene (a1), which inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Priority #2 is rapid cooling (a2) to reduce metabolic demand and prevent further hyperthermia. Key parameters include tracking the ETCO2 (the earliest sign of MH) (p1) and monitoring for rhabdomyolysis/potassium spikes related to the muscle rigidity (p2).",

            "The earliest sign of MH is a sudden, often dramatic, rise in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), NOT the fever. The capnography waveform will also show an increase.",
