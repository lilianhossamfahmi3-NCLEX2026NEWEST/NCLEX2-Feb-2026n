    "correct": "Serotonin Syndrome results from excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system. Combining serotonergic agents like SSRIs (Sertraline) and MAOIs (Linezolid possesses MAOI activity) increases serotonin levels. This leads to hyperstimulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. Clinical manifestations include altered mental status (agitation), autonomic dysfunction (hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus). Immediate discontinuation of serotonergic medications is crucial to halt further serotonin accumulation. Benzodiazepines are administered to manage agitation, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status (deep tendon reflexes, clonus) is essential to assess treatment effectiveness and detect complications.",
    "incorrect": "Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant used primarily for Malignant Hyperthermia and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), not Serotonin Syndrome. Increasing the SSRI dose would exacerbate the condition and potentially lead to fatal complications. While CK levels may be elevated due to muscle activity, monitoring deep tendon reflexes and clonus provides more specific and immediate information about the severity of serotonin excess. Lithium levels are irrelevant in this clinical context.",
