Initial assessment indicates possible preeclampsia. <b>Background:</b> The client has no prior history of hypertension or other significant medical conditions. This is her first pregnancy. Prenatal care has been inconsistent. <b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the client reported blurred vision and a severe headache rated 8/10. Blood pressure is elevated at 158/104 mmHg. Urine dipstick shows 2+ protein. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Fetal heart rate is 152 bpm. The client's face and hands are visibly edematous. <b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate preeclampsia protocol, including continuous blood pressure monitoring, magnesium sulfate infusion if indicated, and consultation with the obstetrician. Prepare for potential seizure activity and further evaluation of fetal well-being."
