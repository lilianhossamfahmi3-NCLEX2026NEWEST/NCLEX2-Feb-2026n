The patient is a 58-year-old who received a blood transfusion 7 days ago and is now presenting with fatigue and jaundice.<br><b>Background:</b> The patient has a history of anemia and has received multiple transfusions in the past. The most recent transfusion was during knee surgery a week ago. <br><b>Assessment:</b> At 09:00, the client exhibited mild scleral icterus and reported dark-colored urine. Laboratory results indicate a decrease in hematocrit since discharge, and the DAT (Coombs) test is now positive.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> I recommend ordering a Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) and a Bilirubin screen to assess for a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. Consider IV fluids to support renal perfusion."

This leads to the destruction of transfused red blood cells. Signs include a falling Hgb, rising indirect bilirubin (jaundice), dark urine, and a positive Coombs test (DAT). The nurse must notify the Blood Bank (a1) so future units can be cross-matched for the new antibody. Supporting the kidneys with IV fluids (a2) helps clear the hemoglobin breakdown products, preventing acute tubular necrosis. Tracking Hgb (p1) monitors the ongoing hemolysis, and Bilirubin/Haptoglobin (p2) assesses the severity of red cell breakdown.",
