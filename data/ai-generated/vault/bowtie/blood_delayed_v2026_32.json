    "correct": "The client is experiencing a Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR) (c2), which typically occurs 3–14 days after transfusion. It is caused by an amnestic (memory) response to a previously encountered Minor Blood Group antibody. Signs include a falling Hgb, rising indirect bilirubin (jaundice), and a positive Coombs test (DAT). The nurse must notify the Blood Bank (a1) so future units can be cross-matched for the new antibody and support the kidneys with fluids (a2) to clear the hemoglobin breakdown products. Tracking Hgb (p1) and Bilirubin (p2) is essential.",
