He appears anxious and agitated. <br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The patient reports attending a party earlier in the evening. He denies any prior medical history or known allergies. He is a track athlete and reports being in good health prior to tonight. <br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> Vital signs: BP 188/110 mmHg, HR 152 bpm, RR 26 breaths/min, T 100.8°F (38.2°C), SpO2 96% on room air. EKG shows ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF. Pupils are dilated (8mm bilaterally). The patient is restless and picking at his skin. Troponin I is elevated at 0.08 ng/mL. Toxicology screen is positive for cocaine and amphetamines.<br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring. Administer IV benzodiazepines as prescribed. Obtain serial EKGs. Monitor vital signs closely. Consider cardiology consult."

Cocaine causes intense coronary artery vasospasm and increases myocardial oxygen demand, leading to ischemia (ST depression) and myocardial injury (elevated troponin). The priority actions are to administer IV benzodiazepines (a1) to counteract the sympathetic overdrive and reduce anxiety, and to obtain serial EKGs (a2) to monitor for resolution or worsening of the ischemia. Continuous monitoring of vital signs (p1), especially blood pressure and heart rate, and continuous EKG monitoring (p2) are crucial for managing the hypertensive crisis and detecting any arrhythmias.",
