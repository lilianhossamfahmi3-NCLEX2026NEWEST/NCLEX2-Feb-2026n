    "correct": "Preeclampsia with severe features is primarily caused by placental ischemia and abnormal remodeling of spiral arteries (c1, c2). The priority actions are to prevent seizures with magnesium sulfate (a1) and control blood pressure with hydralazine or labetalol (a2). Monitoring deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) (p1) and urine output (p2) is crucial for detecting magnesium toxicity.",
