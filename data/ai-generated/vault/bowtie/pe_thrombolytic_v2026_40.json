Initial treatment included Heparin. The client has a history of a major GI bleed two years ago.<br><b>Assessment:</b> Current vital signs include BP 72/40 mmHg, HR 142 bpm, RR 36 breaths/min, and SpO2 78% on 15L NRM. The client is cyanotic around the mouth and unresponsive to verbal stimuli.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Given the client's critical condition, I recommend initiating rescue thrombolytic therapy with Alteplase (t-PA) immediately. Prepare for potential complications, including bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is essential."

Alteplase (t-PA) (a1) is the appropriate intervention for hemodynamically unstable PE to dissolve the clot and restore pulmonary blood flow. Due to the increased bleeding risk associated with thrombolytics, all new invasive procedures should be avoided (a2) after the infusion starts. Close monitoring for signs of intracranial hemorrhage, such as changes in the level of consciousness and pupil response (p1), is crucial. Continuous assessment of blood pressure and MAP (p2) is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and detect any further hemodynamic instability.",
