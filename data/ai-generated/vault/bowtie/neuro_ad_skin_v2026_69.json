The client is shivering.<br><b>Background:</b> The client has a complete T3 level SCI and self-catheterizes. The bladder was recently emptied.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The client's BP is 210/118, HR is 52, and RR is 24. The client reports blurred vision and is extremely flushed on their face and chest. Skin assessment reveals a Stage 2 pressure injury on the sacral region and compression socks rolled tight.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Immediately elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees and inspect for non-urological triggers, such as skin pressure or tight clothing. Monitor BP and heart rate closely."

Even though the bladder is empty, any painful or irritating stimulus below the level of the injury (T3) can cause a sympathetic surge. The priority is to elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees (a1) to immediately lower the blood pressure. The next priority is to remove the triggering stimuli (a2) by loosening the socks and alleviating pressure on the sacral sore. Parameters to monitor include frequent blood pressure and heart rate monitoring (p1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions and neurological symptoms such as visual changes and headache (p2) indicating the severity of the hypertensive crisis.",
