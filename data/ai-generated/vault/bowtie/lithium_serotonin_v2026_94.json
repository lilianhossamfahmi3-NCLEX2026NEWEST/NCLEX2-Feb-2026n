    "correct": "The client is experiencing serotonin syndrome (c2). Lithium potentiates serotonin, and when combined with a high-dose SSRI (sertraline), it can trigger a life-threatening autonomic crisis. Key signs are hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia (103.2°F/39.6°C), and mydriasis. Priority actions include stopping the serotonergic drugs (a1) and administering benzodiazepines (a2) to reduce body temperature and muscle rigidity. Monitoring should focus on temperature/clonus (p1) and autonomic stability (p2).",
