Lithium potentiates serotonin, and when combined with a high-dose SSRI (sertraline), it can trigger a life-threatening autonomic crisis. Key signs are hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia (103.2°F/39.6°C), and mydriasis. Priority actions include stopping the serotonergic drugs (a1) to prevent further serotonin accumulation and administering benzodiazepines (a2) to reduce body temperature and muscle rigidity. Monitoring should focus on core temperature and presence of inducible clonus (p1) to assess the effectiveness of cooling measures and autonomic stability (p2) to detect any cardiovascular compromise.",
