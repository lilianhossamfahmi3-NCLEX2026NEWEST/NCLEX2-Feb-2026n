    "correct": "Chronic tobacco smoke exposure (c1) is a primary cause of emphysema, damaging alveoli and reducing gas exchange. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (c2) is a genetic cause, leading to protease-mediated lung damage. Low-flow oxygen (a1) is crucial to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive in COPD patients; target SpO2 88-92%. Pursed-lip breathing (a3) creates back pressure, preventing alveolar collapse and improving ventilation. Monitoring SpO2 (p1) and respiratory rate/effort (p2) are essential to assess oxygenation and ventilation effectiveness.",
    "incorrect": "Occupational dust exposure (c3) can contribute to COPD but is less directly linked to emphysema than smoking or AAT deficiency. Acute viral infection (c4) can exacerbate COPD but doesn't cause emphysema. Chest physiotherapy (a2) is more appropriate for secretion clearance, not the primary issue in emphysema. Rapid tracheal suctioning (a4) is unnecessary unless there's excessive secretion production. Urine output (p4) is not a direct indicator of respiratory status in emphysema. Sputum color/consistency (p3) is relevant for infection, but less critical than oxygenation and ventilation.",
