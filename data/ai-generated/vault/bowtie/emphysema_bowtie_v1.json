        "correct": "Chronic tobacco smoke exposure (c1) is the leading cause of emphysema, damaging alveoli and impairing gas exchange. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (c2) is a genetic risk factor. Low-flow oxygen (a1) is essential to maintain SpO2 within 88-92% to avoid suppressing the hypoxic drive. Pursed-lip breathing (a3) helps prevent alveolar collapse and improves ventilation. Monitoring SpO2 and ABGs (p1) and respiratory rate/effort (p2) are crucial for assessing oxygenation and ventilation.",
        "incorrect": "Occupational exposure to respiratory irritants (c3) can contribute to COPD but is less directly linked to emphysema than smoking or AAT deficiency. History of frequent respiratory infections (c4) can exacerbate COPD but doesn't cause emphysema. Administering bronchodilators via nebulizer (a2) is helpful for symptom management but not the priority. Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage (a4) are more appropriate for secretion clearance, not the primary issue in emphysema. Fluid balance and hydration status (p4) are important but less direct indicators of respiratory status. Sputum characteristics (p3) are relevant for infection, but less critical than oxygenation and ventilation.",

Instruct and reinforce pursed-lip breathing technique. Monitor respiratory rate, effort, and SpO2 continuously. Obtain ABGs to assess acid-base balance. Consider bronchodilator therapy if wheezing is present. Notify provider of assessment findings and plan of care."
