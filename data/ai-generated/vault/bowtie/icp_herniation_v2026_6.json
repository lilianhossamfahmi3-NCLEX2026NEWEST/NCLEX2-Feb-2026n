At 14:15, the ICP increased to 35 mmHg. The client was initially responsive to verbal commands but is now non-responsive. GCS has dropped from 12 to 6. The right pupil is now dilated and fixed at 6mm, while the left remains reactive at 3mm. Decerebrate posturing is noted. Vital signs show a widening pulse pressure (192/68 mmHg), bradycardia (HR 48 bpm), and irregular Cheyne-Stokes respirations (RR 10 breaths/min).<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Immediate interventions to reduce ICP and prevent further neurological damage are required, including potential surgical decompression."

The rapid increase in ICP, coupled with a fixed and dilated pupil on the right side, decerebrate posturing, and Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), strongly suggests herniation. Hyperventilation (a1) is a temporizing measure to decrease PaCO2, causing cerebral vasoconstriction and reducing ICP. Limiting suctioning (a2) prevents further increases in ICP. Monitoring motor response (p1) and ABGs (p2) helps evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and guide further treatment.",
