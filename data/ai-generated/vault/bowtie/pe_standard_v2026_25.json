BMI is 34, with a history of tobacco use. The client is currently on bed rest with sequential compression devices (SCDs) in place. <br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:30, the client reported sudden onset chest pain that worsens with inspiration (pleuritic). Skin is dusky and pale. Vital signs indicate respiratory distress. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Stat V/Q scan or CT Angiography is recommended to rule out pulmonary embolism. Consider immediate anticoagulation therapy."

Key findings: Pleuritic chest pain, acute hypoxia (SpO2 84%), tachycardia, tachypnea, and a high D-Dimer. Priority actions: Optimizing gas exchange via HOB elevation (a1) facilitates lung expansion and oxygenation. Stopping clot propagation with Heparin (a2) prevents further emboli.
