This condition can occur up to 6 weeks postpartum, even in women without a history of hypertension during pregnancy. The pathophysiology involves endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm, leading to increased blood pressure and potential neurological complications. The priority nursing actions are to initiate IV magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (a1) and assess deep tendon reflexes while implementing seizure precautions (a2). Magnesium sulfate prevents seizures by acting as a central nervous system depressant. Key parameters to monitor include blood pressure and mental status (p1), as well as headache intensity and vision changes (p2) to assess for worsening cerebral edema or impending stroke.",
