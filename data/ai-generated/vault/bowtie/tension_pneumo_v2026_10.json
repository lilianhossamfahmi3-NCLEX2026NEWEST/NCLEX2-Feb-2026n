Initial assessment revealed multiple rib fractures.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the patient exhibits severe respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min and an SpO2 of 76% on room air. Blood pressure is 78/40 mmHg, and heart rate is 148 bpm. Jugular venous distention (JVD) is present, and breath sounds are absent on the right side, with hyper-resonance to percussion. Trachea is deviated to the left.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Prepare for immediate needle decompression of the right chest, followed by chest tube insertion. Administer 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask and anticipate the need for fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to support blood pressure."

This pressure causes lung collapse, mediastinal shift, and impaired venous return, resulting in jugular venous distention (JVD), tracheal deviation, and cardiovascular collapse. The priority nursing actions are emergent needle decompression (a1) to release the trapped air and restore normal pressure, and applying 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask (a2) to maximize oxygenation. Monitoring tracheal alignment (p1) and auscultation of breath sounds bilaterally (p2) are essential parameters to assess the effectiveness of the decompression and to detect any recurrence of the tension pneumothorax.",
