Cues include severe hypertension (BP 212/110), bradycardia (HR 52), pounding headache, and flushing above the injury. The first priority is to sit the client upright (a1) to cause orthostatic reduction in BP. The second priority is to identify and remove the noxious stimulus, commonly a distended bladder or fecal impaction (a3). Serial monitoring of BP/HR and bladder status (p1, p2) is critical to ensure the crisis resolves once the stimulus is removed.",
