Abdomen is soft, non-tender. 1410: Notified the physician of the change in condition and implemented interventions per protocol. 1415: Bladder scan performed; revealed 600 mL urine. Catheterized per order, draining 550 mL clear yellow urine. 1430: BP rechecked at 160/90 mmHg; headache improving. Continues to monitor vital signs and symptoms. Educated patient on autonomic dysreflexia triggers and prevention strategies. 1445: Patient reports headache intensity is now 4/10."

Assessing for and removing any impaction is crucial as bowel distention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Monitoring blood pressure closely allows for assessment of the effectiveness of interventions and guides further treatment. Monitoring heart rate is important because bradycardia is a common sign of autonomic dysreflexia due to the baroreceptor reflex.",

Encouraging deep breathing and coughing exercises will not address the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia. Lowering the head of the bed will worsen the hypertension and is contraindicated.

Skin temperature below the level of injury is already expected to be cool and dry due to the interruption of sympathetic pathways, so this is not the priority.",
