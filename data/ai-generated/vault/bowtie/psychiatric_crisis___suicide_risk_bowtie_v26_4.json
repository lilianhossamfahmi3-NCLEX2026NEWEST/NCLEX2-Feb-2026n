  "stem": "A 32-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by police after being found shouting and pacing in a public park, exhibiting symptoms of agitation and paranoia. He reports feeling like people are trying to harm him and expresses a sense of being watched and pursued. The patient has a known history of bipolar disorder but has been non-compliant with his prescribed medication regimen for several months. Upon examination, his pupils are dilated, and he is sweating profusely, indicating a possible altered state. A urine drug screen is performed, which returns positive for amphetamines, suggesting recent stimulant use. Considering the client's medical history, current presentation, and laboratory findings, determine the most likely contributing causes to his current condition, accurately assess his condition, and select the most appropriate interventions to stabilize him and ensure his safety within the emergency department setting.",

    "correct": "The patient's presentation of agitation, paranoia, dilated pupils, sweating, and positive amphetamine screen strongly suggests stimulant-induced psychosis. The underlying bipolar disorder increases vulnerability. Stabilizing the patient and managing the psychosis are primary goals, requiring antipsychotics and a calm environment. Safety is paramount.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to consider amphetamine use as a primary driver of the psychosis leads to incorrect choices. While bipolar disorder is a factor, the acute presentation is linked to the stimulant. Not prioritizing immediate stabilization and safety jeopardizes the patient's well-being. Ignoring de-escalation techniques and focusing solely on medication misses crucial aspects of acute management.",
