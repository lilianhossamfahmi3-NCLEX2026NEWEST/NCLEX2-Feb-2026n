The subgaleal drain is in place. <b>BACKGROUND:</b> Surgical intervention to remove a brain tumor. Baseline neurological status was intact prior to surgery. <b>ASSESSMENT:</b> At 10:00, the client reports a persistent 'drip' sensation at the back of her throat and an escalating headache, rated 7/10. Upon inspection, the dressing is moist. Pharyngeal exam reveals clear fluid. A bedside halo test was performed. <b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> The nurse recommends immediate evaluation for possible cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, neurological assessment, and potential adjustment of the subgaleal drain. Consider pain management strategies for headache."
