    "correct": "The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The chest pain radiating to the left arm, diaphoresis, and anxiety are classic symptoms. Elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial damage. The ST-segment elevation indicates transmural ischemia, necessitating immediate intervention to restore blood flow and prevent further cardiac damage. Nitroglycerin is used to dilate coronary arteries and reduce preload, while morphine helps manage pain and anxiety. Oxygen supports adequate oxygenation of the ischemic myocardium. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that inhibit platelet aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation. Cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options fail to address the acute nature of the MI or provide treatments that are not immediately indicated. Some options might address secondary issues but do not directly target the underlying cause of myocardial ischemia. Selecting incorrect causes or interventions could lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment, potentially worsening the patient's condition and increasing the risk of complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.",
