    "stem": "A 62-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe, crushing chest pain radiating down his left arm. He is diaphoretic and anxious. His vital signs are: HR 110 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I is 12 ng/mL (Normal <0.04 ng/mL). Based on this information, identify the most likely causes, the patient's condition, and the appropriate interventions.",

        "correct": "The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The chest pain radiating to the left arm, diaphoresis, and anxiety are classic symptoms. Elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial damage. The ST-segment elevation in inferior leads indicates transmural ischemia, necessitating immediate intervention to restore blood flow and prevent further cardiac damage. Oxygen supports adequate oxygenation of the ischemic myocardium. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that inhibit platelet aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options fail to address the acute nature of the MI or provide treatments that are not immediately indicated. Some options might address secondary issues but do not directly target the underlying cause of myocardial ischemia. Selecting incorrect causes or interventions could lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment, potentially worsening the patient's condition and increasing the risk of complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemia and pulmonary embolism are less likely given the ECG and troponin results. Stable angina is less likely given the acute presentation and elevated troponin. Furosemide and fluid bolus are not indicated at this time.",
