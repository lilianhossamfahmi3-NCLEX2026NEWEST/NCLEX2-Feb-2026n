Mother is G1P1, blood type O positive. Infant blood type is A positive. Cord blood Coombs negative. \n\n07:15: Initial assessment revealed acrocyanosis, otherwise pink centrally. RR 68, slightly labored. HR 170, regular. Temp 36.2°C (97.2°F) axillary. Blood glucose via heel stick 42 mg/dL. Fed 15 mL formula without difficulty. \n\n07:45: Repeated blood glucose 38 mg/dL. Noted mild jitteriness. Mother at bedside, educated on signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and importance of frequent feedings. Contacted provider with updated assessment findings and lab values.\n\n08:00: Provider order received. Will recheck glucose in 30 minutes. Continue monitoring vital signs and feeding every 2-3 hours."
