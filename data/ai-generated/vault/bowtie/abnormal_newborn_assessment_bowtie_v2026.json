    "correct": "The newborn is exhibiting classic signs of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN), which is common after C-section deliveries due to the lack of 'thoracic squeeze' that helps clear fetal lung fluid. The X-ray findings (fluid in fissures, sunburst pattern) are pathognomonic for TTN. The priority actions are to support oxygenation and ensure the infant is monitored in an environment capable of acute care (NICU). Respiratory effort and SpO2 are the primary parameters to evaluate the resolution of the fluid clearance.",
    "incorrect": "Neonatal sepsis would typically present with temperature instability (hypothermia often) and poor perfusion, which are absent here. RDS is more common in premature infants and shows 'ground glass' appearance on X-ray, not fluid in fissures. MAS requires a history of meconium-stained fluid and shows patchier infiltrates. Gavage feeding is not the immediate priority for an infant with acute tachypnea.",
