The patient received the second unit of FFP as part of treatment for coagulopathy.<br><b>Background:</b> The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis, contributing to impaired coagulation. The current transfusion was initiated to address active bleeding.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The patient exhibits severe dyspnea, with a respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min and SpO2 of 74% on 6L NC. Auscultation reveals diffuse bilateral crackles. She is producing frothy, pink sputum. Blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg, and temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C).<br><b>Recommendation:</b> STAT portable chest x-ray. Strongly consider Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) versus Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO). Immediate intervention required, including stopping the transfusion and providing respiratory support."

        "correct": "The most likely condition is Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) (c2). TRALI is characterized by acute respiratory distress and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema following a blood transfusion. Key indicators differentiating TRALI from TACO (Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload) include HYPOTENSION (BP 88/52 mmHg) and FEVER (101.8°F/38.8°C). TACO typically presents with hypertension and no fever. TRALI is an inflammatory lung injury caused by donor antibodies reacting with recipient leukocytes, leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability. The priority nursing actions are to immediately stop the transfusion and notify the provider and blood bank (a1) to prevent further exposure to the causative agent. Aggressive respiratory support (a2) with oxygen, CPAP, or intubation may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation. Monitoring parameters include blood pressure and core temperature (p1) to assess hemodynamic stability and fever progression, as well as oxygenation status (ABGs/SpO2) and breath sounds (p2) to evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory support and detect changes in pulmonary status.",
