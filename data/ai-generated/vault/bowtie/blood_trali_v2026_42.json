    "correct": "This is TRALI (c2). The key differentiators from TACO are the HYPOTENSION (BP 88/52 mmHg) and the FEVER (101.8°F/38.8°C). TACO usually causes hypertension and no fever. TRALI is an inflammatory lung injury caused by donor antibodies. Priority actions are stopping the trigger (a1) and supporting ventilation (a2) since TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion-related death. Parameters include monitoring hemodynamics (p1) (Hypotension risk) and gas exchange (p2).",
