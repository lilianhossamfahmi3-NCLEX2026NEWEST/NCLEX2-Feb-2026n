Daughter reports a history of hypothyroidism and states her mother has 'forgotten to take her pills' for several weeks. Found unresponsive in a cold house. Initial vital signs are concerning.<br><br><b>Background:</b> Patient has a known history of hypothyroidism, managed with levothyroxine. Daughter reports poor medication adherence in recent weeks. Patient was found at home in a severely hypothermic state.<br><br><b>Assessment:</b> On arrival at 08:15, the patient is stuporous, responding weakly to stimuli. Skin is very dry and thickened, with notable puffiness and periorbital edema. Vital signs: BP 88/52, HR 42 (bradycardia), RR 8 (shallow), SpO2 86% on room air. Core temperature is 94.2°F (34.6°C). Serum TSH is 92.0 mIU/L (High), and Free T4 is 0.1 ng/dL (Low).<br><br><b>Recommendation:</b> Given the patient's presentation and history, Myxedema Coma is suspected. Immediate interventions are required, including gentle rewarming, respiratory support, and IV levothyroxine administration. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is essential."

        "correct": "The client presents with a classic clinical picture of Myxedema Coma (c2), characterized by severe hypothermia, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and altered mental status. The extremely elevated TSH and low free T4 levels confirm severe hypothyroidism. The primary nursing actions are aimed at gentle rewarming (a1) to prevent rapid vasodilation and shock, and emergent IV levothyroxine (T4) administration (a2) to replace the deficient hormone. Continuous monitoring of core temperature (p1) is crucial to assess the effectiveness of rewarming efforts and prevent hyperthermia. Monitoring respiratory effort and arterial blood gases (ABGs) (p2) is essential due to the risk of respiratory failure associated with myxedema coma.",
