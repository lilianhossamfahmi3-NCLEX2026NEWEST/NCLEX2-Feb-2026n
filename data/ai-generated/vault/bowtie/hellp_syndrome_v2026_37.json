She reports severe epigastric pain and nausea.<br><b>Background:</b> The client was admitted for monitoring due to elevated blood pressure, initially recorded at 152/94 mmHg. She has a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:30, the client appears jaundiced and reports worsening right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. Vital signs show BP 172/114 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, and RR 22 breaths/min. Lab results indicate platelets 62,000 /mm³, AST 192 U/L, ALT 210 U/L, and total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL. Hemoglobin and hematocrit show a falling trend. Petechiae are noted on her arms.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Given the client's presentation and lab results, HELLP syndrome is suspected. Recommend immediate consultation with the obstetrician for consideration of emergent delivery and stabilization of clotting factors. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, lab values, and fetal heart rate is essential."

The epigastric pain is due to swelling of the liver, and petechiae are due to thrombocytopenia. The definitive treatment is delivery (a1) to prevent further maternal and fetal complications. Given the critically low platelet count, a platelet transfusion (a2) is essential to mitigate the risk of hemorrhage during and after delivery. Monitoring platelet count and signs of bleeding (p1) allows for timely intervention if the client's condition worsens. Monitoring hepatic enzyme levels and RUQ pain (p2) helps assess the progression or resolution of liver damage.",
