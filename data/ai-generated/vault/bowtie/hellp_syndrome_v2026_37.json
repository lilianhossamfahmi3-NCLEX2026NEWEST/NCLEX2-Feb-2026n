HELLP stands for Hemolysis (low hemoglobin/high bilirubin), Elevated Liver enzymes (AST/ALT), and Low Platelets. Epigastric pain and petechiae are also common symptoms. The definitive treatment is delivery (a1), and the low platelet count increases the risk of hemorrhage, necessitating platelet transfusion (a2). Monitoring platelet count and signs of bleeding (p1) and hepatic enzyme levels and RUQ pain (p2) are crucial.",
