The chest pain began approximately 30 minutes ago while shoveling snow and is rated as 10/10 on a pain scale. No known allergies.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The patient is diaphoretic, clutching his chest (positive Levine's sign), and appears anxious. Initial vital signs are concerning for cardiac compromise. 12-Lead EKG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate ACS protocol immediately, administer oxygen, obtain serial cardiac enzymes, and prepare for emergent cardiac catheterization.

This signifies complete occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The immediate priority is to restore blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. Administering chewable aspirin 324 mg (a1) inhibits platelet aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation. Preparing the client for emergent cardiac catheterization (a2) facilitates prompt percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to open the blocked artery. Continuous ST-segment monitoring (p1) allows for real-time assessment of the effectiveness of interventions and detection of re-occlusion. Serial Troponin I levels (p2) are crucial for quantifying the extent of myocardial damage and monitoring for further infarction.",
