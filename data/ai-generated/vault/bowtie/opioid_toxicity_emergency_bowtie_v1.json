        "correct": "The patient presents with classic signs of opioid toxicity: pinpoint pupils (miosis), respiratory depression, and unresponsiveness. The priority is to reverse the respiratory depression with naloxone and support ventilation with a BVM. Monitoring respiratory rate, depth, and level of consciousness (GCS) are crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration. Naloxone acts as an opioid antagonist, binding to opioid receptors and reversing the effects of the opioid. BVM provides immediate respiratory support, ensuring adequate oxygenation and preventing hypoxia.",
        "incorrect": "Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist and is not indicated for opioid overdose. Atropine is used to treat bradycardia, but the primary issue in opioid overdose is respiratory depression, not bradycardia. While bradycardia can occur secondary to hypoxia, addressing the respiratory depression is the priority. Blood glucose monitoring is not a primary concern in the initial management of opioid overdose. Pupil size and reaction, while indicative of opioid use, are not the most sensitive parameters for monitoring the patient's response to treatment.",

            "Naloxone has a shorter half-life (30-90 minutes) than many opioids (e.g., morphine, heroin, fentanyl). Repeated doses or continuous infusion of naloxone may be necessary to prevent recurrent respiratory depression as the opioid effects return. Monitor for withdrawal symptoms (agitation, vomiting) after naloxone administration.",
