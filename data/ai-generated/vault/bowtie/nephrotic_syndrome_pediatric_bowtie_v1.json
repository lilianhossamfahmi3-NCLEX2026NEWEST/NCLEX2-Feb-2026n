    "correct": "Minimal Change Disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. The pathophysiology involves damage to the glomerular podocytes, leading to increased permeability and massive proteinuria. This protein loss results in hypoalbuminemia, decreased oncotic pressure, and subsequent edema. Administering corticosteroids, like Prednisone, is the first-line treatment as it helps to reduce glomerular permeability and decrease protein excretion. Daily urine protein testing monitors the effectiveness of treatment. Monitoring abdominal circumference and daily weights helps assess fluid retention. Edematous skin is prone to breakdown, requiring vigilant skin care.",
    "incorrect": "A high-salt diet exacerbates edema by increasing fluid retention. Placing an immunocompromised child (due to steroid use) in a room with a child with pneumonia increases the risk of infection. While blood pressure monitoring is important, it is not the priority in MCD as hypertension is less common than in other glomerular diseases. Serum glucose is not directly related to the pathophysiology of MCD.",
