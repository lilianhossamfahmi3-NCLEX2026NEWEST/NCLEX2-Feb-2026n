Client reports increased fatigue and decreased appetite over the past week.\n\n1430: Client reports occasional muscle weakness and cramping. Skin turgor is normal. Oral mucosa is moist. Educated client on importance of adhering to prescribed medication regimen and dietary restrictions (low sodium).\n\n1445: Noted client's potassium level is elevated per lab results. Notified provider of potassium level and current symptoms. Waiting for further orders. Encouraged client to verbalize concerns and answered questions regarding treatment plan."
