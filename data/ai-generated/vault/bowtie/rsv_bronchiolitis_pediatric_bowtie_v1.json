        "correct": "The infant presents with classic signs of RSV bronchiolitis: rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing. RSV causes inflammation and necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium, leading to increased mucus production and airway obstruction. Infants are obligate nose breathers, making nasal congestion a significant problem. Frequent nasal suctioning helps clear the airway, improving gas exchange. Humidified oxygen supports oxygenation by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired air and preventing further drying of the airway. Monitoring respiratory rate, effort, hydration status, and I&Os allows for early detection of clinical deterioration and guides fluid management.",
        "incorrect": "RSV bronchiolitis is a viral infection; antibiotics are ineffective. Chest physiotherapy is generally not recommended for bronchiolitis as it can be poorly tolerated and may not improve outcomes. While skin color (e.g., cyanosis) is an important assessment parameter, respiratory rate, work of breathing, hydration status, and I&Os provide more sensitive and specific indicators of the infant's respiratory and fluid balance status in the acute phase.",
