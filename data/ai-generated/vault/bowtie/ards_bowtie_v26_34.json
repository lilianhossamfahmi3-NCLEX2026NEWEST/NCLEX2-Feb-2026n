    "correct": "Sepsis is a major cause of ARDS due to the systemic inflammatory response. Increased alveolar-capillary permeability results in pulmonary edema. Prone positioning helps improve oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation. Low tidal volume ventilation prevents ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) by minimizing alveolar overdistension.",
    "incorrect": "Aspiration pneumonia can cause ARDS, but sepsis is the primary diagnosis here. Hypovolemia is unlikely in ARDS; fluid overload is more typical. High tidal volume ventilation can worsen lung injury. Supplemental oxygen alone will not address the underlying pathology. Nebulized bronchodilators are more appropriate for asthma or COPD exacerbations.",
