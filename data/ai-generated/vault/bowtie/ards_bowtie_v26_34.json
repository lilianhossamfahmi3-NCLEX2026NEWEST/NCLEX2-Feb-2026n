        "correct": "Sepsis is a major cause of ARDS due to the systemic inflammatory response. Increased alveolar-capillary permeability is a hallmark of ARDS, leading to pulmonary edema. Prone positioning improves oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation. Low tidal volume ventilation prevents ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) by minimizing alveolar overdistension.",
        "incorrect": "Aspiration pneumonia can cause ARDS, but sepsis is the primary diagnosis in this case. Hypovolemia is unlikely in ARDS; fluid overload is more typical. High tidal volume ventilation can worsen lung injury. Supplemental oxygen alone will not address the underlying pathology of ARDS. Nebulized bronchodilators are more appropriate for conditions like asthma or COPD exacerbations.",
