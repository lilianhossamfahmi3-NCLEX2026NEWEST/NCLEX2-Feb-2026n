No known allergies.\n18:00 A: Patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate 2mg IV every 2 hours PRN for pain. Abdomen is distended and firm to palpation. Bowel sounds are hypoactive in all four quadrants. Incision site is clean, dry, and intact. Last voided 6 hours ago, small amount. Vital signs trending as noted in vital signs tab. \n18:00 R: Recommend assessing for possible paralytic ileus or post-operative complications. Consider an abdominal X-ray to rule out obstruction or free air. Monitor vital signs closely and continue pain management. Encourage ambulation as tolerated. Notify surgeon if condition worsens. "
