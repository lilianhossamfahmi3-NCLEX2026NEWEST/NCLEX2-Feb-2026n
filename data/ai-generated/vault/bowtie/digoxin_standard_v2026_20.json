    "correct": "The client exhibits signs of acute digoxin toxicity (c2): critically high serum digoxin level (3.1 ng/mL), visual disturbances (halos), bradycardia (HR 48 bpm), and PVCs. The elevated creatinine level (2.1 mg/dL) suggests impaired renal clearance, likely contributing to the toxicity. The priority nursing actions are to withhold the digoxin dose (a1) and administer the antidote, DigiFab (a2). Continuous cardiac monitoring (p1) is crucial to assess for life-threatening arrhythmias, and monitoring serum digoxin and electrolyte levels (p2) helps guide further treatment.",
