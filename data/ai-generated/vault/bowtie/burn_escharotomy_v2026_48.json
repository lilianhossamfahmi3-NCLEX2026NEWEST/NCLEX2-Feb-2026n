The incident occurred approximately 2 hours ago.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The skin on the left forearm is 'leathery,' tight, and non-compliant. The left hand is cool and pale with an absent radial pulse upon palpation, though a weak Doppler 'hiss' is present. Capillary refill is greater than 5 seconds. The client reports an inability to flex fingers.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> The priority is immediate surgical decompression (escharotomy) to restore distal perfusion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and perfusion status is essential. Pain management and psychological support should also be provided."

            "correct": "Circumferential full-thickness burns (c2) result in the formation of a tough, inelastic tissue called eschar. As the underlying tissues swell due to the inflammatory response from the burn, the eschar acts like a tourniquet, compromising circulation. This is essentially 'Burn-Induced Compartment Syndrome'. The priority intervention is an escharotomy (a1) to release the constricting pressure and restore blood flow. Assessing distal pulses via Doppler ultrasound (a2) is crucial because manual palpation is often unreliable through the charred skin. Key parameters to monitor include pulse quality and any sensory changes in the affected extremity (p1). Respiratory effort (p2) is important to monitor because circumferential burns to the chest can restrict chest wall expansion, impairing ventilation.",
