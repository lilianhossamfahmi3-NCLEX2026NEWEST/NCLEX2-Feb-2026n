As the tissue underneath swells from the burn inflammatory response, the eschar acts as a tourniquet, cutting off circulation. This is essentially 'Burn-Induced Compartment Syndrome'. The priority is an Escharotomy (a1) to release the pressure. Assessing pulses via Doppler (a2) is critical because manual palpation is often impossible through charred skin. Parameters include the pulse (p1) and respiratory expansion (p2) (if the burn were on the chest).",
