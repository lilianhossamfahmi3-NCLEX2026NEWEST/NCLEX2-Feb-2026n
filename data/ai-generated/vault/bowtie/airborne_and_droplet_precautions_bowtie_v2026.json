Influenza is primarily transmitted via large-particle droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. Therefore, Droplet Precautions (surgical mask, hand hygiene) are mandatory. Increased fluid intake is a priority supportive intervention to prevent dehydration from the high fever and to thin respiratory secretions for easier expectoration. Monitoring oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential to detect complications like secondary bacterial pneumonia or ARDS, and assessing sputum characteristics helps identify changes that might suggest a secondary bacterial infection (e.g., transition from clear to purulent sputum).",

Antibiotics are not effective for viral infections like Influenza. While educating the client is important, it is secondary to the immediate safety of staff (droplet precautions) and clinical stabilization (fluids). Bowel sounds and pain levels are not priority parameters in a primary respiratory infection scenario.",
