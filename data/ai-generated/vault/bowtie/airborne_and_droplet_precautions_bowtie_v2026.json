O2 saturation is 90% on room air.\n\nBackground: History of COPD, managed with home oxygen at 2L per nasal cannula. Recent travel to Southeast Asia two weeks ago. No known allergies.\n\nAssessment: Client is alert and oriented x3, but appears anxious. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in both lungs. Temperature 38.5°C. Heart rate 110 bpm, regular. Respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute and labored. Reports chills and muscle aches. \n\nRecommendation: Request order for chest x-ray to confirm pneumonia. Consider sputum culture to identify causative organism. Implement appropriate respiratory precautions. Increase oxygen to maintain saturation above 92%. Assess response to treatment and notify provider of any deterioration."
