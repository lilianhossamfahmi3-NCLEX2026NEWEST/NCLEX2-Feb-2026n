        "correct": "The client is most likely experiencing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) (c2), a complication predominantly seen in type 2 diabetes. Key differentiators from DKA include significantly elevated glucose levels (typically >600 mg/dL), a normal pH indicating the absence of acidosis, and minimal or no ketones in the urine. The cornerstone of treatment is aggressive rehydration (a1) with isotonic fluids to address the profound dehydration, which is critical for stabilizing blood pressure and improving overall perfusion. Following initial fluid resuscitation, IV regular insulin (a2) is initiated to gradually lower the blood glucose levels. It is crucial to administer fluids first to prevent potential circulatory collapse due to rapid shifts in osmolality. Continuous monitoring of mental status and neurological assessments (p1) is essential due to the risk of cerebral edema from rapid changes in serum osmolality. Hourly monitoring of blood glucose and serum electrolytes (p2) is also necessary to guide insulin and fluid adjustments and to detect and correct any electrolyte imbalances that may arise during treatment.",

            "HHS carries a higher mortality rate compared to DKA, primarily because it often affects older adults with multiple comorbidities.",
