Differentiating factors from DKA include: glucose much higher (>600 mg/dL), normal pH (no acidosis), and no ketones. Rehydration (a1) is the most critical step because the client is profoundly dehydrated. Insulin (a2) is given to lower the glucose but must follow fluids to prevent circulatory collapse. Monitoring neurological status (p1) is vital since rapid changes in osmolality can cause cerebral edema, and glucose (p2) must be tracked hourly.",
