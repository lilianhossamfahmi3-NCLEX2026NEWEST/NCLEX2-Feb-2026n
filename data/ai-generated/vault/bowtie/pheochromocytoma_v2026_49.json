The patient has no prior history of hypertension. Initial workup is underway to determine the underlying cause.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:30, the client is experiencing an episode, reporting a 'pounding' sensation in her chest and exhibiting tremors. Blood pressure is significantly elevated at 238/122 mmHg. The patient denies any other symptoms.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Continue monitoring vital signs, administer prescribed medications as ordered, and await results of the 24-hour VMA and metanephrine urine collection to rule out pheochromocytoma."

Normal thyroid labs rule out thyroid storm (c1). Nursing actions should focus on minimizing stimulation to prevent further catecholamine release (a1) and avoiding abdominal palpation, which could trigger a hypertensive crisis (a2). Monitoring blood pressure (p1) and neurological status (p2) are crucial for detecting and managing complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke. ",
