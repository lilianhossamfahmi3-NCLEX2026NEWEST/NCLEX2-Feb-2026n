        "correct": "The patient presents with signs and symptoms indicative of an acute ischemic stroke. Given the symptom onset within the thrombolytic window (typically 3-4.5 hours), initiating IV Alteplase (tPA) is the priority to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the affected brain tissue. Strict blood pressure control (typically <185/110 mmHg) is crucial before, during, and after tPA administration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Continuous neurological monitoring using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is essential to assess the patient's response to treatment and detect any signs of deterioration. Blood pressure monitoring is also critical to maintain cerebral perfusion and prevent complications.",
        "incorrect": "Lumbar puncture is not indicated in the acute management of ischemic stroke unless there is suspicion of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, which has been ruled out by CT scan. Heparin is contraindicated in the acute phase of ischemic stroke when tPA is being considered or administered due to the increased risk of bleeding. While monitoring for signs of bleeding is important, it is not the most immediate or sensitive parameter for evaluating the patient's response to tPA or detecting early complications. Muscle strength grading is part of the NIHSS but is not as critical as overall neurological status and blood pressure monitoring in the acute phase.",
