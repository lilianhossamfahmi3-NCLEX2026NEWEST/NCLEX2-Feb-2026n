Key findings include the absence of brainstem reflexes such as pupillary response, corneal reflex, and gag reflex, as well as the absence of spontaneous respirations (p1), confirmed by a formal apnea test. A critical prerequisite for accurate brain death determination is ensuring the client is normothermic (p2), as hypothermia can confound the assessment. Once brain death is confirmed, the nurse is responsible for notifying the OPO (a1) per hospital policy and maintaining hemodynamic stability (a2) to preserve organ viability if organ donation is being considered.",
