    "correct": "Assessing for an air leak in the chest tube system is crucial to identify and address any potential issues that could compromise the system's effectiveness. Maintaining the chest tube drainage system below the level of the chest promotes gravity drainage and prevents backflow of fluid into the pleural space. Monitoring respiratory rate and effort allows for early detection of changes in respiratory status that may indicate worsening of the pneumothorax or complications. Monitoring chest tube drainage amount and characteristics helps assess the effectiveness of the chest tube in removing air and fluid from the pleural space. Oxygen saturation provides information about the patient's oxygenation status and the effectiveness of oxygen therapy.",
    "incorrect": "Repositioning the patient to the left lateral decubitus position is not indicated for a right-sided pneumothorax and may compromise respiratory function. Encouraging the patient to cough and deep breathe may be contraindicated if it causes increased pain or instability. Milking or stripping the chest tube is generally not recommended due to the risk of increasing intrathoracic pressure and damaging lung tissue. Administering a prescribed bronchodilator is not indicated for a pneumothorax. Monitoring CVP is not the most relevant parameter in this situation. Monitoring white blood cell count is not directly related to the management of a pneumothorax.
