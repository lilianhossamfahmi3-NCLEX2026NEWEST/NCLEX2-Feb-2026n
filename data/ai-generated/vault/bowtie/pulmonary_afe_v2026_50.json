AFE occurs when amniotic fluid and fetal debris enter the maternal circulation, triggering a two-phase response. Phase 1 involves pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure, while Phase 2 leads to left-sided heart failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Priority nursing actions include administering 100% oxygen (a1) to combat the profound hypoxia and tilting the client to the left (a2) to optimize cardiac output by relieving pressure on the vena cava. Continuous monitoring of maternal coagulation status (p1) to detect and manage DIC and hemodynamic stability (p2) to address the cardiovascular collapse are crucial.",
