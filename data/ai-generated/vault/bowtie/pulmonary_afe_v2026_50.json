    "correct": "This is an Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE) (c2), also known as Anaphylactoid Syndrome of Pregnancy. It occurs when amniotic fluid/debris enters the maternal circulation, causing a two-phase response: Pulmonary HTN/Right-sided heart failure (Phase 1) followed by Left-sided failure and massive DIC (Phase 2). Priority actions are ensuring 100% O2 to combat the profound hypoxia (a1) and tilting the patient (a2) to ensure maximal cardiac output. Monitoring focusing on the inevitable DIC (p1) and hemodynamic collapse (p2) is the standard protocol.",
