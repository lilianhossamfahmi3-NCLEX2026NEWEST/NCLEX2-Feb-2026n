He is generally confused and less responsive than baseline. <br><b>Background:</b> The client has a history of stroke and an indwelling urinary catheter due to a neurogenic bladder. He has been residing at the facility for the past 3 years. <br><b>Assessment:</b> The client is stuporous and cool to the touch. Vital signs: BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 108 bpm, RR 26 breaths/min, T 95.8°F (35.4°C), SpO2 91%. Urine in the catheter bag is cloudy and has a strong odor. Lactate is 3.9 mmol/L. WBC is 4,200/µL. The patient is CAM+ for delirium. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> The provider should evaluate the client for possible septic shock and initiate appropriate interventions, including blood cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics."

Elderly patients often present with atypical signs of infection, including acute confusion (delirium), hypothermia (temperature below 96.8°F or 36°C), and hypotension. The elevated lactate level (3.9 mmol/L) further supports the diagnosis of shock. The presence of cloudy, malodorous urine in a patient with an indwelling catheter is highly suggestive of a urinary source of infection. Priority nursing actions include obtaining blood and urine cultures immediately (a2) to identify the causative organism before initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids as prescribed (a1). Monitoring should include Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and level of consciousness (p1) to assess perfusion and neurological status, as well as urine output and lung sounds (p2) to monitor fluid balance and prevent fluid overload during resuscitation.",
