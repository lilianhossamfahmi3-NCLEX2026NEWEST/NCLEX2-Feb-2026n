Monitoring for hypoglycemia after insulin administration is crucial due to the rapid onset and short duration of insulin lispro. Administering intravenous normal saline helps to correct dehydration and restore fluid balance. Monitoring blood glucose is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin therapy and prevent hypoglycemia. Respiratory rate and depth should be monitored because Kussmaul respirations are a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis in DKA.",
