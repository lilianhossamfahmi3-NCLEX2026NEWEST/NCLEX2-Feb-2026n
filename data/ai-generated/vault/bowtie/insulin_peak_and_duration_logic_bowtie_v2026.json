Monitoring for hypoglycemia after insulin administration is crucial due to the rapid onset and short duration of insulin lispro. Administering intravenous 0.9% normal saline helps to correct dehydration and restore fluid balance. Monitoring blood glucose is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin therapy and prevent hypoglycemia. Respiratory rate and depth should be monitored because Kussmaul respirations (although not explicitly stated, the increased RR suggests this) are a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis in DKA.",
        "incorrect": "Administering sodium bicarbonate is generally reserved for severe acidosis (pH <7.0) and is not a first-line treatment. Overly rapid correction of acidosis can lead to complications. Encouraging ambulation in a dehydrated and hyperglycemic state can worsen the condition. Monitoring urine output is important for overall fluid balance but is less specific to the acute management of DKA compared to respiratory status. Serum creatinine is relevant to kidney function but is not as critical as blood glucose and respiratory status in the acute management of DKA.",
