    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss from hematemesis. The priority is to restore circulating volume and improve tissue perfusion. Initiating two large-bore IV lines allows for rapid administration of fluids and potential blood products. Rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids (0.9% normal saline) expands the intravascular volume, increasing preload and cardiac output. Monitoring hourly urine output is crucial to assess renal perfusion and the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Blood pressure and heart rate are key indicators of hemodynamic stability and response to treatment.",
    "incorrect": "Administering morphine can further decrease blood pressure due to its vasodilatory effects, which is contraindicated in hypovolemic shock. Applying a warm blanket is a secondary intervention; addressing the underlying hypovolemia is the priority. While WBC count and serum lactate level can provide additional information, they are not the primary parameters for immediate assessment and management of hypovolemic shock. Lactate is a marker of anaerobic metabolism, which can be elevated in shock, but monitoring vital signs and urine output provides more immediate feedback on resuscitation efforts.",

      "In hypovolemic shock, the body compensates by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure. However, these compensatory mechanisms eventually fail, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and organ damage.",
