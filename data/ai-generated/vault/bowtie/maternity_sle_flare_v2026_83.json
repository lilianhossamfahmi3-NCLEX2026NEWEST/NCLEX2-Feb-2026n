She is being closely monitored due to her high-risk pregnancy status.\n<br>\n<b>Assessment:</b> At 14:30, the client's blood pressure was recorded at 152/98 mmHg. Urine protein is 3+. The client exhibits a faint 'butterfly' rash on her face and reports joint pain, consistent with a potential SLE flare. Lower extremity edema is noted as 2+.\n<br>\n<b>Recommendation:</b> The priority is to differentiate between preeclampsia and an SLE nephritis flare. Stat serum complement (C3/C4) levels and anti-dsDNA antibody testing are recommended to evaluate for SLE activity. Consider a rheumatology consult."

The key differentiators in this case are the critically LOW Complement (C3/C4) levels and markedly ELEVATED Anti-dsDNA, which are indicative of active autoimmune consumption and inflammation. In preeclampsia, complement levels are typically normal or elevated. Priority nursing actions involve managing the autoimmune flare with corticosteroids, such as Prednisone (a1), as prescribed, and closely monitoring the inflammatory markers, specifically Serum C3/C4 complement levels (a2), to assess the response to treatment. Parameter monitoring should focus on assessing disease activity through Serum Complement levels (C3/C4) and dsDNA titers (p1) and evaluating fetal well-being due to the increased risk of placental insufficiency (p2).",
