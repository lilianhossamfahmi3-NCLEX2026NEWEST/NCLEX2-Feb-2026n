        "correct": "The patient's symptoms (paranoia, agitation, pressured speech) and history of bipolar disorder strongly suggest a manic episode. Non-compliance with medication is a common trigger. Prioritizing patient safety and stabilization through medication and a calm environment is essential. Close monitoring for escalation of symptoms is also vital. De-escalation techniques should be employed to reduce agitation and promote a safe environment for both the patient and staff. Benzodiazepines can quickly alleviate agitation. Antipsychotics will then help stabilize mood.",

Incorrect interventions may be harmful or not address the immediate needs of the patient. Delaying medication administration prolongs suffering. Focusing on long-term therapy is less important than the immediate crisis. Ignoring the patient's agitation could lead to self harm or harm to others.",

He reports feeling paranoid and believes people are trying to harm him. He has a history of bipolar disorder but is not taking his prescribed medication. He is currently agitated, pacing, and speaking rapidly. His vital signs are stable, but he is exhibiting signs of escalating anxiety. I'm concerned about his safety and the safety of those around him. I recommend immediate intervention to de-escalate the situation and manage his symptoms. I have initiated standard precautions and placed him in a quiet room to minimize stimulation. Requesting orders for medication to manage agitation and paranoia.",
