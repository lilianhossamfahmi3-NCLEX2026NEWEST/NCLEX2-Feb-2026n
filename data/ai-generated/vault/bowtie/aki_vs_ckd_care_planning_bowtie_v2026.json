Indicators include a sudden rise in creatinine from baseline (2.8 vs 0.9), elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio, and high urine specific gravity (1.035). Priority actions include strict fluid management (weights/I&Os) and preventing further kidney insult by adjusting nephrotoxic drugs. Monitoring urine output and electrolytes (especially potassium, which is already 5.2) is critical during the oliguric phase of AKI to detect life-threatening imbalances.",
