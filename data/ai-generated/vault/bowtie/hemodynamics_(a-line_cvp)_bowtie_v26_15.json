    "correct": "Elevated CVP indicates increased preload, suggesting fluid overload or impaired right ventricular function. Low MAP indicates decreased afterload and poor tissue perfusion, which can be related to vasodilation from sepsis. Given the patient's septic shock, vasodilation and increased venous return are likely culprits. Administering vasopressors will increase the blood pressure and improve tissue perfusion, while diuretics will reduce the elevated CVP and decrease preload. Titrating fluids cautiously is essential, as the patient may not need more volume.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated CVP suggests increased preload, not hypovolemia. Administering fluids without assessing the patient's volume status could exacerbate the fluid overload. While antibiotics are essential for treating the underlying infection, they do not directly address the immediate hemodynamic instability. Cardiac glycosides will not address the vasodilation. Initiating a blood transfusion is not indicated without evidence of significant blood loss or anemia. The patient requires vasoconstriction, not vasodilation.",
