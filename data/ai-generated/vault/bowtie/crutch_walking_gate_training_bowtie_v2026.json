States, \"I'm not sure I'm doing this crutch thing right.\" O: Client is post-op day 3 from ORIF right tibial fracture. Currently prescribed partial weight-bearing on right leg. Ambulation observed in hallway using 4-point gait. Demonstrates inconsistent weight-bearing on right leg, favoring left leg. Upper body strength appears adequate. A: Ineffective crutch walking technique secondary to pain and inadequate understanding of weight-bearing restrictions. Risk for falls. P: Will reinforce proper crutch walking technique with emphasis on weight-bearing restrictions and pain management. Consult physical therapy for further evaluation and gait training. Educate on importance of adhering to prescribed weight-bearing status. Encourage use of pain medication prior to ambulation. Assess pain level and ambulation technique with each shift. 07:15 Pain medication administered. 07:45 Client reports pain reduced to 3/10. Will reassess after ambulation training."
