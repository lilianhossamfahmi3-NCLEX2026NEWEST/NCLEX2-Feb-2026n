Surgical repair was performed yesterday. The patient has no significant past medical history.<br><br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> At 14:30, the patient was noted to be increasingly confused and agitated. Orthopedic assessment reveals normal neurovascular status of the surgical limb. Respiratory assessment reveals tachypnea and bilateral crackles. Skin assessment reveals clusters of non-blanchable red spots across the chest and neck (petechiae). Vital signs include BP 138/84, HR 122, RR 30, SpO2 88% on 2L NC, and T 101.4°F.<br><br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> I recommend immediate evaluation for potential pulmonary complications, specifically Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), and escalation of oxygen therapy."

The petechiae are caused by fat globules obstructing capillaries. Unlike Compartment Syndrome, where the affected limb is ischemic and neurovascular compromise is present, the neurovascular checks in FES are typically normal. Immediate actions focus on maximizing oxygenation with high-flow oxygen (a1) and minimizing further fat release from the fracture site by maintaining strict immobilization of the fractured limb (a2). Parameters to monitor include daily inspection of the chest and neck for worsening or resolution of petechiae (p1) and continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) monitoring to assess the effectiveness of oxygen therapy (p2).",
