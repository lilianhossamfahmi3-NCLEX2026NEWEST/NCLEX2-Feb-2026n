At 14:00, the client reported a sudden onset of severe 'tearing' pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ).<b>Assessment:</b> At 14:15, the client is pulseless and appears grey. Significant abdominal distention is noted in the RUQ. Vital signs: BP 52/30 mmHg, HR 162 bpm, RR 32 breaths/min. Skin is cool and clammy. Hemoglobin is 4.2 g/dL (dropped 6 points). Abdominal girth increased by 4 cm in the last 30 minutes.<b>Recommendation:</b> Prepare the client for immediate exploratory laparotomy for suspected liver rupture. Initiate Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)."

In HELLP syndrome, elevated liver enzymes indicate liver swelling. If the swelling becomes excessive, the liver capsule can 'tear,' causing severe RUQ pain, and subsequently rupture into the peritoneum, leading to rapid hypovolemic shock (BP 52/30 mmHg). The priority nursing actions are to initiate the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) (a1) to replace lost volume and clotting factors and prepare the client for emergent laparotomy for surgical liver repair (a2). Key parameters to monitor include abdominal girth and RUQ pain (p1) to assess for ongoing bleeding and blood pressure and heart rate (p2) to evaluate the client's hemodynamic status.",
