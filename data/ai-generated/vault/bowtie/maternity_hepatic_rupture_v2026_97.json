The liver enzymes in HELLP are high because the liver is swelling; if it swells too much, the capsule 'tears' (RUQ pain) and ruptures into the peritoneum. This causes rapid Hypovolemic Shock (BP 52/30). Priority actions are MTP (a1) to replace volume/factors and immediate surgery (a2). Key parameters include tracking the distending abdomen (p1) and shock vitals (p2).",
