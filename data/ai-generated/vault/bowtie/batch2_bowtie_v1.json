Classic signs are 'board-like' abdominal rigidity, extreme pain, and dark red bleeding. Hypertension and cocaine use are major risk factors. This is a medical emergency; monitoring the fetus (FHR) and preparing for delivery (C-section) are paramount. Monitoring focus is on uterine tone and signs of fetal distress. The most common cause of Abruptio Placentae is maternal hypertension.",

A vaginal exam (a3) is strictly contraindicated in late-pregnancy bleeding until previa is ruled out, as it can cause catastrophic hemorrhage. Ambulation (a4) is dangerous during active hemorrhage. Leopold's maneuver (p4) determines fetal position, which is secondary to fetal survival monitoring.",
