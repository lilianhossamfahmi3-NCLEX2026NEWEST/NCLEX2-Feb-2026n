Because the patient cannot feel the 'Pain out of Proportion' (due to the sensory block), the nurse must rely on objective cues like the manometry pressure (36 mmHg) and the 'rock-hard' tension of the limb. Priority #1 is notifying the surgeon for a likely fasciotomy (a1) and Priority #2 is maintaining neutral positioning (a2) to optimize perfusion. Parameters focus on the objective pressure (p1) and pulses/motor status (p2).",
