Temp this morning 38.5°C, HR 110, RR 24, BP 100/60. O2 sat 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Patient is increasingly confused and agitated. 14:00: Noted new onset of purulent drainage from the IV insertion site. Site is also erythematous and tender to the touch. WBC count elevated (see labs). Patient reports chills. Antibiotics were administered per order at 13:00. Dressing changed using sterile technique. Provider notified and new orders pending. Encourage PO fluids. Continue to monitor vital signs and IV site closely. 14:30: Patient’s temperature is now 39.1°C. Provider at bedside assessing patient. 15:00 Blood cultures obtained. New antibiotic order received: Vancomycin to be administered after blood cultures are complete. Monitor for signs of anaphylaxis."
