He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and minimal urine output. Nursing notes indicate airway edema and Lactated Ringers infusing at 1000 mL/hr.

        "correct": "Increased capillary permeability and fluid shift to the interstitial space are primary causes of hypovolemic shock in burn patients. The Parkland formula guides fluid resuscitation, calculating the total fluid requirement in the first 24 hours post-burn. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with Lactated Ringers is crucial to maintain organ perfusion due to fluid shifts from the intravascular space.",
        "incorrect": "Hypervolemic shock is incorrect as the patient is losing fluid to the interstitial space. Decreased cardiac contractility and increased systemic vascular resistance are not the primary causes in this early burn shock scenario. Furosemide is contraindicated in hypovolemic shock. Vasopressors are not the first line unless fluid resuscitation fails. Failure to titrate fluids per Parkland formula can lead to inadequate resuscitation.",
