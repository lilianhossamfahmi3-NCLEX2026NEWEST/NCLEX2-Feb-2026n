  "stem": "A 62-year-old male was involved in a house fire and sustained full thickness burns to 45% of his body. He weighs 75 kg. The patient is intubated and requires burn resuscitation. His current presentation includes hypotension, tachycardia, and minimal urine output. Nursing notes indicate airway edema and the initiation of Lactated Ringers at 1000 mL/hr. Lab results show elevated potassium and lactate levels. Vitals remain unstable despite initial fluid administration. Given this scenario, and based on the information, match the appropriate causes, condition, and interventions for this patient.",

    "correct": "The Parkland formula guides fluid resuscitation by calculating the total fluid requirement in the first 24 hours post-burn. In burn shock, capillary permeability increases, leading to fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitium, causing hypovolemia and subsequent decreased cardiac output. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is crucial to maintain organ perfusion. LR is preferred due to its electrolyte composition closely resembling plasma.",
    "incorrect": "Inadequate fluid resuscitation can lead to hypovolemic shock and end-organ damage. Over-resuscitation can lead to pulmonary edema and abdominal compartment syndrome. Albumin is typically used after the first 24 hours. Potassium is generally avoided in initial resuscitation due to potential hyperkalemia from cell damage. Vasopressors are not the first line unless fluid resuscitation fails to maintain adequate blood pressure.",
