    "correct": "Actions: Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is appropriate to decrease the patient's potassium level. Initiating cardiac monitoring is necessary due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Condition: The patient is presenting with hyponatremia (Na 120 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K 6.2 mEq/L), and signs of hypervolemia (edema, crackles). Parameters: Level of consciousness should be monitored due to the risk of neurological complications from hyponatremia. Urine output should be monitored to assess renal function and the effectiveness of interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Actions: Increasing the rate of normal saline infusion could worsen the hypervolemia. Administering hypotonic fluids could exacerbate the hyponatremia. Preparing for dialysis may be necessary, but other interventions should be attempted first. Parameters: Blood pressure is important, but not as critical as neurological and renal status in this situation. Serum calcium levels are not directly related to the sodium and potassium imbalances.
