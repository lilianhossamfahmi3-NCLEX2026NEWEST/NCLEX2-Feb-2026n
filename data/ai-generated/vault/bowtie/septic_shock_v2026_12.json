He is showing signs of septic shock, likely secondary to his UTI. <br><b>Background:</b> Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old male admitted for urosepsis. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and diabetes mellitus. <br><b>Assessment:</b> At 07:00, the client was found to be disoriented to person and place. His skin is mottled and cool to the touch. Vital Signs: BP 82/50 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, T 102.8°F (39.3°C), SpO2 93% on 2L NC. Serum lactate is 5.2 mmol/L, and MAP is 58 mmHg. WBC count is 24,000/mm³. Blood cultures are pending. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> I recommend implementing the sepsis bundle immediately, including fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics."

The client's presentation (confusion, mottled skin, elevated temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, elevated lactate and WBC) supports this diagnosis. Priority interventions include rapid fluid boluses (a1) to restore volume and broad-spectrum antibiotics (a2) to treat the source of infection. The primary parameters to monitor are MAP (p1) to evaluate perfusion and lactate (p2) to evaluate cellular hypoxia/anaerobic metabolism. Trends in these values will help determine the effectiveness of interventions.",
