Arrived at 10:00.\nBackground: Patient was found in a collapsed building; extricated by fire rescue. No known medical history available. Reports severe pain (8/10). \nAssessment: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 24, SpO2 96% on 15L NRB. Circumferential burns noted on bilateral upper extremities and anterior torso. Audible wheezing. Cap refill >3 seconds. GCS 14.\nRecommendation: Initiate fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula. Monitor urine output. Administer pain medication. Consider escharotomies if circulation compromised. Obtain ABGs. Prepare for possible intubation if respiratory status declines. Consult burn center.",

Half of this (5600 mL) is administered in the first 8 hours. Pain management is crucial due to the severe pain associated with burns, requiring IV opioids. Assessing peripheral pulses is vital to detect compartment syndrome from circumferential burns. Hourly urine output monitoring ensures adequate fluid resuscitation and kidney perfusion. Assessing respiratory status (auscultating lungs) allows for early detection of pulmonary complications like edema or pneumonia, common in burn patients.",
