Half of this (5600 mL) is administered in the first 8 hours. Pain management is crucial due to the severe pain associated with burns, requiring IV opioids. Assessing peripheral pulses is vital to detect compartment syndrome from circumferential burns. Hourly urine output monitoring ensures adequate fluid resuscitation and kidney perfusion. Assessing respiratory status (auscultating lungs) allows for early detection of pulmonary complications like edema or pneumonia, common in burn patients.  These interventions directly address the immediate threats to the patient's survival and well-being in the acute phase of burn management.",

For example, while preparing for escharotomies might be necessary later, it is not the priority in the first few hours.
