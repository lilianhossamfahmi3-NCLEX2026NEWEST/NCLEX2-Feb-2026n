    "stem": "A 62-year-old male is admitted to the ICU following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Initial assessment reveals a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8. Over the past hour, the nurse observes the following changes: increasing systolic blood pressure, widening pulse pressure, and a decreasing heart rate. Based on these findings, determine the likely causes, the patient's condition, and the appropriate interventions.",

        "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of Cushing's Triad (hypertension with widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), a late sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Likely causes include the traumatic brain injury and subsequent cerebral edema. The patient's condition is increased ICP. Appropriate interventions should focus on reducing ICP, such as administering osmotic diuretics like mannitol and positioning the patient to promote venous drainage from the head by elevating the head of the bed.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options include causes and interventions that are not directly related to the emergent management of increased ICP and Cushing's Triad. Some options might be related to other neurological conditions or general supportive care, but they do not address the immediate threat posed by increasing ICP. Focusing on the most likely cause and immediate interventions is critical. For example, while cardiac monitoring is important, it does not directly address the elevated ICP.",
