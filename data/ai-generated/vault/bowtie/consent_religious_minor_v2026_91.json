The parents, devout Jehovah's Witnesses, refuse a life-saving blood transfusion due to religious beliefs.<br><b>Background:</b> The child's hemoglobin is 4.2 g/dL, and arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.21, indicating severe acidosis. The surgery occurred yesterday, and the child initially recovered well.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The parents are calm but resolute in their refusal, stating, 'We cannot allow blood; it is against our faith.' The child is lethargic, with a blood pressure of 72/40, heart rate of 158, and respiratory rate of 32.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Immediate petition for temporary state guardianship is recommended to override the parental refusal and administer the necessary blood transfusion. Continue resuscitation efforts with non-blood volume expanders while awaiting the court order."

While competent adults have the right to refuse care based on religious beliefs, this right does not extend to parents making decisions that lead to their child's death. The nurse's priority is to facilitate the legal process for obtaining an emergency court order (a1) to administer the necessary blood transfusion. Simultaneously, the nurse should continue volume resuscitation with non-blood products (a2) to stabilize the child until the court order is obtained. Monitoring parameters should focus on the child's hemodynamic stability (BP/HR) and hemoglobin levels (p1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions, as well as the status of the emergency court order and administrative approval (p2) to ensure timely legal intervention.",
