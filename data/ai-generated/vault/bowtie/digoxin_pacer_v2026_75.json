Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node; when toxic (4.8), it can completely block the node, leading to dissociative rhythms. Priority #1 is the antidote, Digibind (a2), which binds the drug. However, until the antidote works, the patient is in shock (BP 74/38). Transcutaneous Pacing (a1) is the immediate bridge to keep the patient alive. Monitoring focuses on the electrical rate (p1) and hydraulic perfusion (p2).",
