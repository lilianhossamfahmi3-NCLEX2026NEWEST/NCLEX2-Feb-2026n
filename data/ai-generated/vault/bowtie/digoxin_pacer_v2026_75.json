The elevated potassium (hyperkalemia) exacerbates the cardiac effects. Priority interventions include administering Digibind (a2), which binds to and inactivates Digoxin, and preparing for transcutaneous pacing (a1) to maintain adequate cardiac output until the Digibind takes effect. Monitoring should focus on heart rate, EKG rhythm (p1) to assess the effectiveness of pacing and Digibind, as well as blood pressure and mental status (p2) to evaluate perfusion.",
