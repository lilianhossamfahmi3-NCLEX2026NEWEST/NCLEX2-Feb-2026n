Friends report recent cocaine use. \n<br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The client has a history of occasional cocaine use but no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or other cardiac conditions. No known allergies. \n<br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b> The client is profoundly agitated, diaphoretic, and midriatic (dilated pupils). Vital signs: BP 212/118 mmHg, HR 148 bpm, RR 32 breaths/min, T 100.2°F (37.9°C). 12-lead EKG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3. Urine toxicology screen is positive for benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite). Troponin T is slightly elevated at 0.12 ng/mL. Client is screaming in pain.\n<br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> I recommend immediate administration of IV benzodiazepines for sedation and coronary vasodilation with nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers. Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent vital sign assessments are essential."

Cocaine causes a massive catecholamine release, leading to profound vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension. The 12-lead EKG shows ST-elevation (Infarction/Injury), but in a 28-year-old with dilated pupils and positive tox screen, the cause is the drug. Priority actions are Benzodiazepines (a1) to blunt the sympathetic surge and Nitroglycerin/CCBs (a2) to relax the spasmed coronary arteries. Monitoring focuses on the BP surge (p1) and EKG resolution (p2).",
