Currently on warfarin 5mg PO daily, per protocol. 12:00 INR result is 4.5. Patient reports no new bleeding, bruising, or falls. Alert and oriented x3. Pain controlled with PRN acetaminophen. 13:00 Notified MD of INR result; verbal order received to hold warfarin today and recheck INR tomorrow. 13:15 Warfarin held. Discussed dietary considerations with patient, emphasizing consistent intake of vitamin K-rich foods. Encouraged adequate hydration. 13:30 Patient resting comfortably. Will continue to monitor for signs of bleeding and repeat INR as ordered. Educated patient on signs and symptoms of bleeding and importance of follow-up INR checks. 13:45 Patient denies any adverse effects of the medication or any new medications taken."
