    "correct": "This is NSAID-Potentiated Lithium Toxicity (c2). NSAIDs (like Ibuprofen) decrease renal blood flow and prostaglandin synthesis, causing the kidneys to retain more Lithium. Adding a diuretic (HCTZ) further increases this risk. The level of 1.9 mEq/L and the coarse tremors confirm toxicity. The nurse must hold both the offending drugs (a1) and notify the provider (a2). Key parameters include monitoring the toxic drug levels/kidney function (p1) and neurological coordination (p2).",
