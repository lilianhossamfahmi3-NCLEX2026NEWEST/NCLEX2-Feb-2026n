        "correct": "The Parkland formula estimates fluid needs. Inadequate fluid resuscitation, given the burn size and initial vital signs, can lead to hypovolemic shock. Hyperkalemia is likely due to cell damage from the burns, as indicated by the lab results. Administering Lactated Ringer's solution is the appropriate initial fluid for burn resuscitation. Hourly monitoring of urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and ensure adequate renal perfusion. The SBAR indicates no urine output yet, reinforcing the need for close monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "Hyponatremia is less likely than hyperkalemia in the initial burn phase, given the lab values. Over-administration of colloids is not indicated at this stage. Fluid overload is a potential risk, but the initial concern is hypovolemia. Hypernatremia is not supported by the lab data. Administering potassium chloride is contraindicated due to the existing hyperkalemia. While a fluid bolus might be considered, it's not the primary intervention; continuous infusion based on the Parkland formula and urine output is more critical.",
