    "correct": "The Parkland formula estimates fluid needs. Inadequate fluid resuscitation leads to hypovolemic shock and renal failure. Hyperkalemia is common in burn injuries due to cell damage. Urine output should be maintained at 30-50 mL/hr to ensure adequate renal perfusion. Isotonic crystalloids, like lactated Ringer's, are preferred. Frequent vital sign monitoring is essential to assess the client's response to fluid resuscitation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering colloids (albumin) too early can exacerbate fluid shifts and pulmonary edema. Potassium administration is contraindicated in the acute phase due to the risk of hyperkalemia. While central lines may be needed later, peripheral IV access is sufficient initially. Decreased urine output indicates inadequate fluid resuscitation. Hyponatremia is less likely than hyperkalemia in the initial burn phase. Fluid boluses can lead to fluid overload.",
