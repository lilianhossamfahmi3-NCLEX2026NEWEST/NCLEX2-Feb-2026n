Recent medication changes include no new medications. <br><b>07:10 A:</b> On assessment, the client exhibits an unsteady gait, slurred speech, and coarse tremors. Vital signs are stable but concerning given the presentation. Serum lithium level is elevated at 2.1 mEq/L. Estimated GFR is 28 mL/min, indicating moderate to severe impairment. <br><b>07:15 R:</b> I recommend immediate withholding of lithium, notifying the provider, and preparing for potential hemodialysis given the client's lithium toxicity and impaired renal function.

In older adults, lithium can accumulate gradually, even at standard doses, especially with declining renal function. A lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L, combined with neurological signs such as ataxia and slurred speech, indicates toxicity. The nurse should immediately withhold the lithium (a1) to prevent further accumulation and notify the provider. Preparing for hemodialysis (a2) is crucial as it is the preferred treatment for severe lithium toxicity, particularly when renal function is compromised. Continuous monitoring of serial lithium levels and renal function (p1), along with neurological status and motor coordination (p2), is essential to assess the effectiveness of the interventions and detect any further deterioration or improvement.
