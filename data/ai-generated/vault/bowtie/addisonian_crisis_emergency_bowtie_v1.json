    "correct": "The client presents with classic signs of Addisonian crisis: hypotension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia, often triggered by stress (URI). 0900: Addisonian crisis occurs due to insufficient cortisol and aldosterone. Hydrocortisone replaces deficient cortisol, addressing the primary hormonal deficiency. Normal saline with dextrose corrects hypovolemia and hypoglycemia, improving BP and cellular function. Monitoring electrolytes and vital signs is crucial to assess response to treatment and detect further imbalances.",
    "incorrect": "Oral fludrocortisone is too slow for acute crisis management. Fluid restriction exacerbates hypovolemic shock. Myxedema coma presents with hypothermia and bradycardia.
