Administering PRN haloperidol IM is appropriate to manage acute agitation and psychotic symptoms that pose an immediate threat. Monitoring for escalating agitation and aggression is essential to proactively manage the client's behavior and prevent harm to self or others. Assessing for command hallucinations is vital to determine the content of the hallucinations and whether they are instructing the client to harm themselves.",

While reality orientation can be helpful, it's less effective during acute psychosis and may increase agitation.
