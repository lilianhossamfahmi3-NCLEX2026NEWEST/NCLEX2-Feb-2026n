    "correct": "The client's presentation (hyperthermia, extreme tachycardia, agitation) following thyroidectomy in a patient with Graves' disease strongly suggests thyroid storm. Propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, addressing the underlying cause. Aggressive cooling measures (cooling blankets, ice packs) are crucial to combat hyperthermia and prevent end-organ damage. Monitoring heart rate/rhythm and body temperature provides immediate feedback on the effectiveness of interventions. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition requiring rapid intervention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and neurological complications.",
    "incorrect": "Levothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism or thyroid storm. Administering it would exacerbate the condition. While fluid resuscitation is important, 0.45% NS is hypotonic and may worsen electrolyte imbalances. Isotonic solutions (0.9% NS or Lactated Ringer's) are preferred for initial volume expansion. Blood pressure and serum TSH are less immediate indicators of the patient's response to treatment in the acute phase of thyroid storm compared to heart rate and temperature.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Thyroid storm is a medical emergency characterized by exaggerated hyperthyroid symptoms. It can be triggered by surgery, infection, trauma, or abrupt withdrawal of antithyroid medications. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent mortality. Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are often used to manage tachycardia and other adrenergic symptoms. Glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) can inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and provide adrenal support.",
      "SBAR: Situation: Client post-thyroidectomy with Graves' disease experiencing hyperthermia (105.2°F), tachycardia (165 bpm), and agitation at 1400. Background: History of Graves' disease, recent thyroidectomy. Assessment: Signs and symptoms consistent with thyroid storm. Recommendation: STAT administration of PTU or methimazole, application of cooling measures, and continuous monitoring of heart rate/rhythm and temperature."
