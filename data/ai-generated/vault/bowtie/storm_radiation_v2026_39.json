    "correct": "This is a Thyroid Storm (c2) triggered by radioactive iodine treatment. When I-131 destroys thyroid tissue, a massive amount of pre-formed thyroid hormone can be 'dumped' into the bloodstream simultaneously. Symptoms include severe fever, tachycardia (HR 154), and psychomotor agitation. The nurse should use beta-blockers (a1) to protect the heart and block peripheral hormone conversion, and cooling measures (a2) for the hyperpyrexia. Monitoring heart rhythm (p1) and temp/mental status (p2) is vital.",
