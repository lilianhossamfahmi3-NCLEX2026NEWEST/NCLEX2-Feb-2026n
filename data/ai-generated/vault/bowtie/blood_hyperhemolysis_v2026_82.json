    "correct": "This is Hyperhemolysis Syndrome (HHS) (c2). It is a life-threatening, paradoxical complication of transfusion in SCD patients where the body destroys *both* the transfused donor cells and the patient's own native cells. The key cue is the Hgb dropping BELOW the pre-transfusion baseline (from 6.2 g/dL down to 4.8 g/dL). Priority action #1 is AVOIDING further blood (a1), as more blood will ignite more hemolysis. Priority #2 is immunosuppression with IVIG/corticosteroids (a2). Key parameters include tracking the critical Hgb levels and reticulocyte count trends (p1) and monitoring for hemoglobinuria (p2).",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In HHS, the Hgb drops, the Retic count drops (paradoxically), and the Bilirubin spikes.",
