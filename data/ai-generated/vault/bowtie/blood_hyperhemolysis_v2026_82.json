In HHS, the body destroys both the transfused donor cells and the patient's own native cells, leading to a paradoxical drop in hemoglobin *below* the pre-transfusion baseline (from 6.2 g/dL to 4.8 g/dL). The suppressed reticulocyte count (1%) despite the severe anemia is another key indicator. The priority nursing actions are to avoid further blood transfusions (a1), as this will exacerbate the hemolysis, and to prepare for immunosuppression with IVIG or high-dose corticosteroids (a2) to halt the destructive process. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte count trends (p1) is crucial to assess the response to treatment. Additionally, monitoring urine color and the presence of hemoglobinuria (cola-colored urine) (p2) helps to track ongoing hemolysis.",
