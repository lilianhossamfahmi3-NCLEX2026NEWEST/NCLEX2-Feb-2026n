He has experienced similar episodes three times in the last two hours. Pain is now rated 8/10.<br><b>Background:</b> The client has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stent placement four years ago. Typically, chest pain only occurs during exertion, such as golfing. The client was previously pain-free after stent placement.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The client describes the pain as dull and centrally located. At 11:05, the client received 0.4mg of sublingual nitroglycerin, which provided temporary relief, reducing the pain to 2/10. However, the pain returned at 11:20, now rated 8/10. Current vital signs (VS) are BP 162/98, HR 92, and SpO2 98% on room air. EKG shows T-wave inversions, but no ST-segment elevation. Troponin T and CK-MB are within normal limits.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Given the recurrent chest pain at rest despite nitroglycerin, I recommend continuous cardiac monitoring, a 12-lead EKG, and initiation of a nitroglycerin drip per protocol. Further evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is warranted."

This is characterized by new-onset chest pain that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion, or a change in the pattern of stable angina, increasing in frequency, severity, or duration. The pain is recurring despite initial relief from nitroglycerin (NTG). While initial troponins are normal, the T-wave inversion on the EKG indicates myocardial ischemia. Priority actions include administering nitrates (a1) to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood flow, and obtaining a STAT 12-lead EKG (a2) to monitor for changes indicating progression to NSTEMI or STEMI. Monitoring chest pain (p1) helps evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and monitoring blood pressure (p2) is crucial due to the vasodilatory effects of NTG, which can cause hypotension.",
