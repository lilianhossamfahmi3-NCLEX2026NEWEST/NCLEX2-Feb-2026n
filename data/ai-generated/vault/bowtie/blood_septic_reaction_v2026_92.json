Bacterial contamination in the blood bag, often by Gram-negative bacteria, can lead to rapid-onset septic shock and a high fever (105°F/40.8°C or higher). The key indicators are the extreme fever spike, rigors, and the absence of hemoglobinuria (which would suggest a hemolytic reaction). The priority nursing actions are to immediately stop the transfusion (a1) to prevent further exposure to the contaminated blood and send the blood bag and administration set to the laboratory/blood bank for culture (a2) to identify the causative pathogen. Monitoring should focus on the resulting septic shock (p1), including blood pressure, MAP, and core temperature, as well as renal function (p2) by monitoring urine output and clarity to detect potential acute kidney injury.",
