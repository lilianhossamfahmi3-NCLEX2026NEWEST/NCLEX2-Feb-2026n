      "body": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot or other material blocks a pulmonary artery, disrupting blood flow to the lungs. The most common source of the clot is deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, surgery, trauma, cancer, and hypercoagulable states. Symptoms include sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain (often pleuritic), cough, hemoptysis, and signs of DVT. Hypoxia, tachycardia, and tachypnea are common findings. Massive PE can lead to hemodynamic instability and shock.",
