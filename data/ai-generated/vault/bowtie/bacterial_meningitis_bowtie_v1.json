    "correct": "*N. meningitidis* (c1) and *S. pneumoniae* (c2) are common causes of bacterial meningitis. *N. meningitidis* can cause meningococcemia, indicated by the petechial rash. Droplet precautions (a1) are crucial to prevent the spread of *N. meningitidis* via respiratory droplets. A lumbar puncture (a2) is essential for CSF analysis to confirm the diagnosis, identify the causative organism, and determine antibiotic sensitivities. CSF analysis (p1) reveals elevated white blood cell count, protein levels, and decreased glucose levels in bacterial meningitis. Neurological status monitoring (p2) is vital to detect complications like increased intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, and altered mental status. Bacterial meningitis causes inflammation of the meninges, leading to increased ICP and potential neurological damage.",
    "incorrect": "Increased physical activity (a3) is contraindicated due to the risk of increasing ICP and exacerbating neurological symptoms. Aspirin (a4) is generally avoided due to the risk of Reye's syndrome in children and is not the primary treatment for bacterial meningitis in adults. Antibiotics are the priority. Daily weight (p4) and blood pressure (p3) are less specific and sensitive indicators of neurological status and infection progression compared to CSF analysis and direct neurological assessments.",

Consider a CT scan of the head prior to LP to rule out increased ICP if indicated."
