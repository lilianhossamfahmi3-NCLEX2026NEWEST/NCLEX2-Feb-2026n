The combination of respiratory distress (stridor) and cardiovascular collapse (BP 84/42) requires immediate action. Epinephrine (a1) is the first-line treatment for its vasoconstrictive and bronchodilatory effects. Supporting the airway with O2 (a2) is equally critical. Monitoring airflow (p1) and blood pressure (p2) is necessary to determine if a second dose of Epinephrine is required.",
