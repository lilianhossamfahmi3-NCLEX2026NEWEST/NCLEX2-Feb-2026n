No prior adverse reactions to contrast media are documented.<br><b>Assessment:</b> The client exhibits visible angioedema (lip and tongue swelling) and inspiratory stridor. Vital signs include BP 84/42, HR 138, RR 32, and SpO2 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals expiratory wheezing. The client reports lightheadedness.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Prepare for immediate administration of epinephrine 0.3mg IM. Apply 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask. Monitor airway patency, respiratory effort, blood pressure, and heart rate closely. Consider IV diphenhydramine after epinephrine administration."

The rapid onset of respiratory distress (stridor, wheezing, SpO2 88%) and cardiovascular collapse (BP 84/42, HR 138) necessitates immediate intervention. Epinephrine (a1) is the first-line treatment due to its vasoconstrictive and bronchodilatory effects, which counteract the vasodilation and bronchospasm characteristic of anaphylaxis. Simultaneously, administering 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask (a2) is crucial to support oxygenation. Continuous monitoring of airway patency and respiratory effort (p1), along with blood pressure and heart rate (p2), is essential to assess the client's response to treatment and determine the need for additional interventions, such as a second dose of epinephrine.",
