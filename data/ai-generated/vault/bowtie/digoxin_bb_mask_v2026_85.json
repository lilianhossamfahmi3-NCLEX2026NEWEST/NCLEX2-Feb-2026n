While metoprolol (beta-blocker) also slows the heart rate, the green-tinted vision (xanthopsia) and the elevated digoxin level (2.8 ng/mL) confirm digoxin toxicity. The low potassium (3.4 mEq/L) increases the heart's sensitivity to digoxin's toxic effects. The nurse should withhold both digoxin and metoprolol (a1) and prepare for the administration of digoxin immune Fab (Digibind) (a2). Key parameters to monitor include continuous EKG rhythm and heart rate (p1) and the presence of visual disturbances and nausea (p2).",
