While metoprolol (beta-blocker) also slows the heart rate, the green-tinted vision (xanthopsia) and the elevated digoxin level (2.8 ng/mL) confirm digoxin toxicity. The low potassium (3.4 mEq/L) increases the heart's sensitivity to digoxin's toxic effects. The nurse should withhold both digoxin and metoprolol (a1) due to the synergistic effect of these medications on heart rate and prepare for the administration of digoxin immune Fab (Digibind) (a2) to counteract the digoxin toxicity. Key parameters to monitor include continuous EKG rhythm and heart rate (p1) to detect further arrhythmias or heart block and the presence of visual disturbances and nausea (p2) as indicators of digoxin toxicity.",
