        "correct": "Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis characterized by severe muscle weakness, leading to respiratory failure. The primary defect is a reduction in the number of available acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction due to autoimmune destruction. This impairs neuromuscular transmission, causing skeletal muscle weakness, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, resulting in hypoventilation and respiratory distress. IVIG/Plasmapheresis reduces circulating autoantibodies. Priority is securing the airway and supporting ventilation.",
