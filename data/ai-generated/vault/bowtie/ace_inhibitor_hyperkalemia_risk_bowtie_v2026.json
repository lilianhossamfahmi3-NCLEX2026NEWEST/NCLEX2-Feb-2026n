Currently on enalapril 10mg PO daily, started on admission. \n07:15: Patient reports generalized weakness and muscle cramps. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Noted slight decrease in urine output since yesterday. Vitals stable: BP 130/80, HR 78, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. Potassium level today is 5.8 mEq/L (previous K+ 4.2 mEq/L prior to enalapril initiation). \n07:20: Notified provider of potassium level and patient symptoms. Awaiting further orders. Continue to monitor patient's condition and lab results. Will reassess patient in one hour. Encouraged oral fluid intake. \n07:30: Patient continues to complain of muscle weakness. No changes in vital signs. Urinary output remains decreased. Provider notified again of persistent symptoms. New orders received, see below.\n"
