    "correct": "The client is experiencing severe hyperkalemia (6.4 mEq/L), likely caused by the triple-threat of an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone), and an exogenous potassium supplement in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Priority actions include obtaining an ECG to assess for life-threatening arrhythmias (like peaked T-waves already noted) and immediately stopping all potassium-elevating agents. Monitoring the cardiac rhythm and repeat serum potassium levels are the most critical parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and the risk of cardiac arrest.",
