History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Recent medication change of amlodipine started three days ago. \nAssessment: Patient reports chest pain rated 7/10, radiating to the left arm. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Vitals: BP 90/50, HR 110, RR 28, Temp 37.0°C. \nRecommendation: Request immediate cardiology consult. Prepare for potential cardiac catheterization. Administer oxygen to maintain saturation above 92%. Monitor vital signs and ECG continuously. Obtain serial troponin levels."
