Vitals: BP 168/112 mmHg. <br><b>Background:</b> The client has no prior history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Symptoms started this morning and have progressively worsened. The client denies any other significant medical history.<br><b>Assessment:</b> Significant facial and hand edema are noted, along with 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ with 3 beats of ankle clonus. Urine protein is 3+ on dipstick. The client reports epigastric pain.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Initiate immediate magnesium sulfate loading dose per preeclampsia protocol. Prepare for potential seizure activity and notify the physician immediately. Monitor BP, reflexes, and fetal heart rate closely."

Monitoring should focus on neurological signs such as DTRs and clonus (p1) to detect worsening CNS irritability, and assessing for epigastric pain or hepatic tenderness (p2), which can precede a seizure.
