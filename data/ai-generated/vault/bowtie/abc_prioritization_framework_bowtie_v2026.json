He states, \"I can't catch my breath, and I'm so tired.\"\nB: Patient has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He uses home oxygen at 2L per nasal cannula. He was admitted last year for a similar exacerbation.\nA: On assessment: RR 32, labored; HR 110, regular; BP 160/90; SpO2 88% on 2L NC. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. He is using accessory muscles to breathe. Chest X-ray from yesterday shows hyperinflation and increased mucus plugging.\nR: I have administered albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatment as ordered. I recommend escalating oxygen therapy and notifying the respiratory therapist for further evaluation and potential intervention. The patient appears to be tiring."
