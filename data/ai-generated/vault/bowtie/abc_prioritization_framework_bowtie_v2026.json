    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of acute respiratory failure, characterized by hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mmHg), hypercapnia (PaCO2 62 mmHg), and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.28). Increasing oxygen flow is an immediate supportive measure. However, the lack of response and signs of fatigue (tripod position, accessory muscle use, and new onset confusion/restlessness) indicate that the client requires higher-level ventilatory support. Preparing for intubation and mechanical ventilation is necessary to stabilize the client and prevent respiratory arrest. Continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and level of consciousness is critical to assess the severity of failure and the urgency of advanced airway management.",
    "incorrect": "Administering intravenous bolus fluids is contraindicated if heart failure is suspected (BNP 1200, S3, edema), as it could worsen pulmonary edema. Restricting oral fluids is appropriate given the client's altered mental status and risk for aspiration. Pneumothorax and PE are less likely given the ABG pattern and clear COPD history, although they are on the differential. Peripheral edema and cardiac enzymes are not the immediate parameters for an ABC crisis assessment.",
