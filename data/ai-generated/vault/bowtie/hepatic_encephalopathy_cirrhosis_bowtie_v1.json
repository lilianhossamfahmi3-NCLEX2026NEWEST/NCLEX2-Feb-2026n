Lactulose promotes ammonia excretion by acidifying the colon, converting ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), which is poorly absorbed and eliminated via feces. Rifaximin reduces ammonia production by decreasing the number of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut. Monitoring bowel movements is crucial to assess Lactulose's effectiveness; the goal is 2-3 soft stools daily. Mental status monitoring is vital to assess the effectiveness of interventions.",
