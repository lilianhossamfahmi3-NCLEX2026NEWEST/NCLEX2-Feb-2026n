    "correct": "The client exhibits hallmark signs of DKA (c2): elevated blood glucose, low pH (acidosis), low bicarbonate, and positive urine ketones in a client with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The initial priority is FLUID resuscitation (a1) to address the profound dehydration and prevent circulatory collapse, followed by intravenous Regular Insulin (a2) to shift the body away from ketone production. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels (p1) is essential to prevent a rapid drop, and potassium levels (p2) must be closely monitored because insulin administration causes potassium to shift INTO cells, potentially leading to dangerous hypokalemia.",
