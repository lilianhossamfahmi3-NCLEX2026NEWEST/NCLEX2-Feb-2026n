  "stem": "A 22-year-old male underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left tibia at 1800. At 0000, he reports severe, unrelenting pain (10/10) in his left leg, which is not relieved by morphine. He describes the pain as a deep, throbbing ache, significantly worse than his pre-operative pain. On assessment, his left foot is cool to the touch, with a faint pedal pulse. Complete the bowtie to guide care.",

      "rationale": "Bivalving or removing the cast/dressing immediately reduces external pressure, alleviating the cycle of increasing pressure and ischemia. This is a critical first step to improve perfusion and prevent further tissue damage. Failure to do so can lead to irreversible muscle and nerve damage."

      "id": "action2",
      "text": "Position the limb at the level of the heart",
      "rationale": "Positioning the limb at heart level optimizes arterial perfusion to the affected compartment. Elevating the limb can further reduce arterial inflow, exacerbating ischemia. Lowering the limb excessively can increase edema, worsening the compartment pressure."

      "text": "Notify the surgeon immediately",
      "rationale": "Prompt notification of the surgeon is crucial for timely intervention, which may include a fasciotomy. A fasciotomy is the definitive treatment for compartment syndrome, relieving pressure and restoring blood flow. Delaying notification can lead to permanent tissue damage, nerve injury, and potential limb loss."

    "correct": "The patient's presentation (severe pain unrelieved by analgesics, cool extremity, faint pulse) strongly suggests compartment syndrome. The pathophysiology involves increased pressure within a confined space (the muscle compartment), leading to compression of blood vessels and nerves, resulting in ischemia and potential tissue necrosis. Immediate interventions are aimed at reducing pressure (bivalving/removing cast) and ensuring adequate perfusion (surgeon notification, limb at heart level). Monitoring neurovascular status and pain response is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of interventions.",
