      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Opioid analgesics are crucial for managing the severe pain associated with vaso-occlusive crisis. They bind to opioid receptors in the CNS, reducing the perception of pain. Around-the-clock administration ensures consistent pain relief and prevents breakthrough pain. Morphine is a common choice due to its effectiveness and availability."

      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Aggressive IV hydration is essential to reduce blood viscosity and promote the reversal of sickling. Dehydration exacerbates sickling, leading to increased vaso-occlusion and pain. Hydration helps to dilute the concentration of sickled cells, improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. 1.5x maintenance is a common starting point, but adjustments may be needed based on the patient's response and fluid balance."

Warm compresses are preferred as they promote vasodilation, improving blood flow and reducing pain. Vasodilation helps to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the affected tissues, promoting healing and reducing inflammation."

ACS is characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory distress. Early detection and treatment of ACS are crucial to prevent respiratory failure and death. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 92%, and respiratory rate, effort, and breath sounds should be monitored closely."
