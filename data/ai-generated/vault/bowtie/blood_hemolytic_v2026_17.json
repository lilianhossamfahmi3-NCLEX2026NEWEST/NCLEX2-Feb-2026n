    "correct": "Acute Hemolytic Reaction (c2) is a life-threatening event typically caused by ABO incompatibility. Lower back (flank) pain is a hallmark early sign caused by hemoglobin clogging the renal tubules. The nurse must immediately disconnect the blood and maintain the IV line with a new line of 0.9% normal saline (a1) to support blood pressure. Collecting a urine specimen (a2) to assess for red blood cells/hemoglobin is essential for diagnosis. Frequent vital sign monitoring (p2) and urine output/color monitoring (p1) are critical to assess the patient's response to the reaction and guide further interventions.",
