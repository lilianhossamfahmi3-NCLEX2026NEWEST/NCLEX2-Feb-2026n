The client's symptoms, including lower back (flank) pain, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and dark-red/tea-colored urine, strongly suggest this type of reaction. Lower back pain is a hallmark early sign caused by hemoglobin clogging the renal tubules. The nurse must immediately disconnect the blood and maintain the IV line with a new line of 0.9% normal saline (a1) to support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Collecting a urine specimen (a2) to assess for red blood cells/hemoglobin is essential for confirming the diagnosis. Frequent vital sign monitoring (p2) and urine output/color monitoring (p1) are critical to assess the patient's response to the reaction and guide further interventions. The goal is to maintain adequate blood pressure and monitor kidney function.",
