While the chest pain and elevated Troponin could suggest an MI, the S1Q3T3 pattern on the EKG, elevated D-Dimer, and recent long flight are more indicative of a PE. The right heart is straining against the clot, leading to elevated BNP and Troponin. Priority actions are to optimize oxygenation (a1) and initiate immediate anticoagulation (a2) to prevent further clot propagation. Key parameters to monitor include the presence of right ventricular strain on EKG (p1) and SpO2 levels and respiratory effort (p2) to assess the effectiveness of interventions.",
