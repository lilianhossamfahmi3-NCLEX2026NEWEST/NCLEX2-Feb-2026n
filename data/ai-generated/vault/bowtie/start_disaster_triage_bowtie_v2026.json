Visible abrasions noted. **09:15** Patient states, \"I feel like I can't catch my breath.\" Respiratory rate 30, labored. Heart rate 120. O2 sat 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side. **09:30** Oxygen applied via nasal cannula at 2LPM, O2 sat now 93%. Patient reports increasing right-sided chest pain. **09:45** Respiratory rate 34, labored. Heart rate 128. O2 sat 91% on 2LPM. Patient increasingly anxious. Requesting urgent evaluation by the medical team. Concern for possible pneumothorax or other respiratory compromise given mechanism of injury and clinical decline. Patient’s name is John Smith, DOB 03/15/1988. Allergies: NKDA. **10:00** Physician notified and en route."
