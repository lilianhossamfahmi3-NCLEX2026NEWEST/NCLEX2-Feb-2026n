Noted petechiae on upper arms and chest. 11:00 - Client continues to experience nausea despite scheduled antiemetics. Oral intake minimal. Noted client’s gums are bleeding slightly after brushing teeth. Client denies any pain. Skin is dry and oral mucosa is pale. 13:00 - Called provider to report change in condition and awaiting orders. Encourage oral fluids as tolerated. Monitor vital signs and labs per protocol. Educated client on fall precautions and bleeding precautions. Ensure side rails are up and call light within reach.
