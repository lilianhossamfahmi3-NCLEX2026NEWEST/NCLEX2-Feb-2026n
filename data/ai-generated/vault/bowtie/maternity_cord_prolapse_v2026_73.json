The FHR dropped to 70 bpm.<br><b>Background:</b> The client is a 32-year-old G2P1 at term. Cervical exam reveals 6 cm dilation, 80% effacement, and -2 station. The amniotic fluid was clear and copious.<br><b>Assessment:</b> Continuous FHR monitoring shows persistent bradycardia at 70 bpm with minimal variability. A vaginal examination reveals a soft, pulsating loop palpable ahead of the fetal head, suggestive of umbilical cord prolapse. Maternal vital signs are stable: BP 118/72, HR 88.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Prepare the client for immediate surgical delivery (C-section) to alleviate fetal distress. Maintain manual elevation of the fetal presenting part to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord until delivery."

        "correct": "This is an Umbilical Cord Prolapse (c2). When the membranes rupture while the fetal head is at a high station (-2), the cord can wash down ahead of the head. As the head descends, it compresses the cord, causing severe bradycardia (70 bpm). Priority #1 is maintaining your hand in the vagina to push the head UP and off the cord (a1). This relieves pressure on the umbilical cord, restoring blood flow to the fetus. Priority #2 is using gravity (Knee-Chest/Trendelenburg) (a2) to keep the fetus away from the pelvis. This further reduces cord compression. Monitoring focuses on the FHR (p1) to assess fetal well-being and cord pulsations (p2) to ensure adequate blood flow through the cord.",
