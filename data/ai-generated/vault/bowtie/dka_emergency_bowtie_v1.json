        "correct": "The patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of DKA: hyperglycemia (540 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, HCO3 12 mEq/L), and ketonuria. The priority is to address dehydration and hyperglycemia. An initial bolus of 0.9% Normal Saline (action1) restores intravascular volume, improving perfusion and aiding in glucose excretion. A continuous Regular Insulin infusion (action2) is crucial to gradually lower blood glucose and correct the metabolic acidosis by inhibiting lipolysis and ketogenesis. Hourly blood glucose monitoring (param1) is essential to titrate the insulin infusion and prevent hypoglycemia. Monitoring serum potassium and anion gap (param2) is vital because insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially causing hypokalemia, and the anion gap reflects the severity of metabolic acidosis.",
        "incorrect": "Starting 5% Dextrose with 0.45% NS immediately (action4) is contraindicated as it would further elevate blood glucose levels. Dextrose is added only when glucose levels fall below 250 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia. Subcutaneous Glargine (action3) is a long-acting insulin and is not appropriate for the acute management of DKA. Hemoglobin A1c (param4) reflects long-term glycemic control and is not useful in the acute setting. Weight and skin turgor (param3) are less sensitive indicators of hydration status compared to other parameters.",
