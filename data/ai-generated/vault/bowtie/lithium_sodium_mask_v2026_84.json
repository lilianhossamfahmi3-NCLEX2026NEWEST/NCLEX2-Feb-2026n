Lithium and Sodium are closely related in the kidneys; when the body is depleted of sodium (due to the low-sodium diet and HCTZ, a sodium-wasting diuretic), the kidneys retain lithium as a compensatory mechanism, leading to toxic levels (2.4 mEq/L). The nurse should immediately hold the lithium and HCTZ (a1) to prevent further toxicity and instruct the client to discontinue the low-sodium diet (a2) to restore normal sodium balance. Monitoring serum lithium, sodium, and BUN/Creatinine levels (p1) is crucial to assess kidney function and electrolyte balance. Neurological status, tremors, and tinnitus (p2) are essential parameters to monitor for signs of lithium toxicity.",
