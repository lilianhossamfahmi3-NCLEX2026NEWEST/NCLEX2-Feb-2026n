At 08:00, the client intentionally ingested approximately 50 pills of 300mg lithium. EMS was called at 08:15, and the client arrived in the ED at 08:45. <br><b>Assessment:</b> Upon arrival, at 08:45, the client is obtunded with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11. The client exhibits muscular rigidity and is experiencing focal seizures. Vital signs are BP 92/54 mmHg, HR 108 bpm, and RR 20 breaths/min. The client is currently ictal (seizing). Laboratory results show a serum lithium level of 5.2 mEq/L and a rising serum creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. Urine output is 5 mL/hr, indicating anuria. <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Emergent nephrology consult for consideration of hemodialysis is recommended due to severe lithium toxicity, neurological symptoms, and impending renal failure."

For acute ingestions, if the level is > 4.0 mEq/L (or > 2.5 mEq/L with severe neurological symptoms like seizures/rigidity), hemodialysis (a1) is the treatment of choice to rapidly remove the drug and protect the kidneys. The nurse must also maintain seizure precautions and be prepared for intubation (a2) due to the client's altered mental status and ongoing seizure activity. Key parameters include tracking the lithium's clearance and monitoring for rebound toxicity (p1) and closely monitoring neurological status via GCS and seizure frequency (p2).",
