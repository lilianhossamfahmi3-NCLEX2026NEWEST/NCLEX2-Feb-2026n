    "correct": "Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome is an oncologic emergency resulting from external compression or obstruction of the SVC, often by a tumor. This obstruction impairs venous return from the head, neck, and upper extremities, leading to characteristic signs like facial and neck edema, distended neck veins, and a feeling of fullness in the head. Symptoms worsen when leaning forward due to increased venous pressure. The priority is to alleviate pressure on the SVC by positioning the client in high-Fowler's to promote venous drainage and preparing for definitive treatment such as emergent radiation therapy or stenting to debulk the tumor. Monitoring airway patency and neurological status is crucial due to the risk of airway compromise from edema and increased intracranial pressure from impaired venous drainage.",
