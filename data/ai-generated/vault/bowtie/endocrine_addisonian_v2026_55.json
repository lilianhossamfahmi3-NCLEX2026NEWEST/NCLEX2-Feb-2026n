The deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone leads to hypotension (74/42 mmHg), hyperkalemia (5.8 mEq/L), hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), and hypoglycemia (62 mg/dL). The priority is to replace the missing steroids with IV hydrocortisone (a1) and initiate volume resuscitation with fluids containing sodium and glucose (a2), such as D5NS or 0.9% normal saline. Monitoring should focus on blood pressure stabilization (p1) and correction of electrolyte and glucose imbalances (p2).",
