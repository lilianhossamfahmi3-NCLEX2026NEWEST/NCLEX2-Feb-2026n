Vital signs indicate a possible Cushing's triad. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is decreasing, and pulse pressure is widening (130 mmHg).

Priority actions are to drain volume through mannitol (a2), an osmotic diuretic that reduces cerebral edema, and promote venous drainage via HOB elevation to 30 degrees (a1). Mentation/pupils (p1) and vitals (p2) are the primary parameters for tracking progression and response to interventions.",
