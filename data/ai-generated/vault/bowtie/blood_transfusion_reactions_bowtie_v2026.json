Normal saline infusion initiated via new tubing. Physician notified. Oxygen applied via nasal cannula at 2LPM. 1425: Physician at bedside. Orders received and implemented per physician order. Continuous monitoring in place. 1445: Symptoms improving. T 37.8°C, HR 98 bpm, RR 20, BP 140/80 mmHg, SpO2 97%. J.D. denies further itching. Urticaria fading.
