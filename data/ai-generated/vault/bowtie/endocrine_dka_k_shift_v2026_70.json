If the patient's potassium is already low (3.1 mEq/L), starting insulin will cause it to drop further, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Priority #1 is holding the insulin infusion (a1) until the potassium level is above 3.3 mEq/L. Priority #2 is administering IV potassium supplementation as prescribed (a2) to correct the hypokalemia. The monitoring focus should be on serial serum potassium levels and EKG changes indicative of hypokalemia, such as U-waves (p1), as well as blood glucose levels and the anion gap closure status to assess the effectiveness of DKA treatment (p2).",
