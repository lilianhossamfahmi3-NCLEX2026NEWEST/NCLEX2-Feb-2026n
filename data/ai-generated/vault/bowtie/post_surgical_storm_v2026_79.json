Hallmark signs are the 4 T's: Temperature (104.2), Tachycardia (162), Tremor/Agitation, and Toxicity. Priority actions are blocking the hormone effect with Propranolol (a1) and managing the lethal fever (a2). A critical dual-parameter is monitoring for hypocalcemia (p2), as thyroid surgery often accidentally damages the parathyroids, which could cause a second crisis (tetany) shortly after the storm.",
