The client is 6 hours post-subtotal thyroidectomy.<br><b>Background:</b> The client was pre-treated with Lugol's solution. The surgery involved difficult gland manipulation. The client has a history of Graves' disease.<br><b>Assessment:</b> At 14:00, the client reports feeling 'racing' and is extremely agitated. The client's temperature is 104.2°F (40.1°C). Heart rate is 162 bpm. Blood pressure is 168/94 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min. SpO2 is 92% on room air. Trousseau's sign is negative.<br><b>Recommendation:</b> Consider administering IV Propranolol to inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Check serum calcium levels and monitor for signs of hypocalcemia."

The hallmark signs include hyperthermia (104.2°F), tachycardia (162 bpm), agitation, and psychosis. Priority nursing actions include administering IV Propranolol (a1) to block the effects of thyroid hormone and providing cooling blankets and acetaminophen (a2) to manage the hyperpyrexia. It is also critical to monitor for signs of hypocalcemia (p2) because thyroid surgery can inadvertently damage the parathyroid glands, potentially leading to acute hypocalcemia and tetany.",
