She states the infant babbles frequently but does not use any recognizable words. 09:05 Review of systems: Appetite good, sleeps well, no fever or recent illness. Immunizations are up to date. 09:10 Developmental assessment: Infant crawls proficiently and pulls to stand. Fine motor skills appear age-appropriate, able to grasp small objects. Socially, the infant smiles and interacts with the nurse and mother but does not follow simple one-step commands like 'Give me the toy.' 09:15 Mother verbalizes concern about the lack of verbal communication, comparing the infant to older sibling who was speaking in short sentences at this age. Mother denies any hearing problems or family history of speech delay. 09:20 Plan: Continue to monitor developmental progress. Educate mother on strategies to encourage language development. Refer to speech therapy for further evaluation if no improvement in verbal skills in the next 3 months. Scheduled follow-up appointment in 3 months."
