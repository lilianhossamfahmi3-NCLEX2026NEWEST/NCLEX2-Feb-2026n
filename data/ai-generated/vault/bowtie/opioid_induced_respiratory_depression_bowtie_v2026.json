Reports pain level of 7/10 despite morphine PCA. 07:15 Vital signs stable, but noted patient drowsy. Encouraged to cough and deep breathe. 07:30 Patient now difficult to arouse. Respiratory rate 10 breaths/min, shallow. Pulse oximetry 88% on room air. 07:45 Administered oxygen 2L via nasal cannula. No improvement in respiratory effort or oxygen saturation. Notified the healthcare provider. 07:50 Provider order received for naloxone 0.4mg IV. Naloxone administered. 07:55 Patient more responsive, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Pain level reported as 5/10. 08:00 Continuing to monitor respiratory status closely. Pain management reassessment needed. Family notified of the event and intervention. Plan to discuss alternative pain management strategies with the provider."

    "correct": "Administering naloxone is the appropriate action because it is an opioid antagonist that reverses the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression. Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and improves oxygenation.

Monitoring level of consciousness is important because a decreasing level of consciousness is a sign of worsening respiratory depression.",
