The nurse notes that the client has [generalized muscle pain and tenderness], specifically in the thighs and lower back. The client's [skin is intact], but there is [visible edema] in the lower extremities. The client [has not voided] since admission 4 hours ago. A small volume of urine is obtained via catheterization and is [dark, tea-colored]. Laboratory results show a [creatine kinase (CK) level of 45,000 U/L] and a [serum potassium of 5.8 mEq/L]. The [serum creatinine is 2.4 mg/dL] and the [serum myoglobin is significantly elevated]. The client also exhibits [EKG changes consistent with hyperkalemia].",

        "correct": "Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that releases myoglobin into the blood. The classic triad is muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine. 'Tea-colored' or 'cola-colored' urine is due to myoglobinuria. Extreme elevation of CK (>5 times normal) is diagnostic. Myoglobin is toxic to renal tubules, leading to acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine, oliguria). Intracellular contents like potassium are also released, leading to hyperkalemia and associated EKG changes (e.g., peaked T waves).",
        "incorrect": "The fact that the skin is intact is a negative finding (helpful to rule out external trauma but not a sign of rhabdo). The age and history of collapse are risk factors/context.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The priority treatment for rhabdomyolysis is aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (usually 0.9% NS) to maintain a high urine output (200-300 mL/hr) and 'flush' the myoglobin through the kidneys.",
        "questionTrap": "Myoglobin in the urine may cause a false positive for blood on a dipstick because the dipstick cannot distinguish between hemoglobin and myoglobin.",
