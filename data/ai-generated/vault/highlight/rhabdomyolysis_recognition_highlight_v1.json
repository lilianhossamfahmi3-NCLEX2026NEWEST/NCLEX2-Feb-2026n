The nurse notes that the client has [generalized muscle pain and tenderness], specifically in the thighs and lower back. The client's [skin is intact], but there is [visible edema] in the lower extremities. The client [has not voided] since admission 4 hours ago. A small volume of urine is obtained via catheterization and is [dark, tea-colored]. Laboratory results show a [creatine kinase (CK) level of 45,000 U/L] and a [serum potassium of 5.8 mEq/L]. The [serum creatinine is 2.4 mg/dL] and the [serum myoglobin is significantly elevated]. The client also exhibits [EKG changes consistent with hyperkalemia].",

    "correct": "Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening condition resulting from the breakdown of damaged skeletal muscle, releasing intracellular contents into the bloodstream. Prolonged compression, as in this case, is a common cause. The highlighted findings are indicative of this process. Generalized muscle pain and tenderness occur due to muscle cell damage. Edema results from fluid shifting into damaged tissues. Oliguria or anuria (lack of voiding) and dark, tea-colored urine are due to myoglobinuria, where myoglobin obstructs renal tubules, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). Markedly elevated CK (typically >5 times the upper limit of normal; here, 45,000 U/L) confirms muscle damage. Hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) arises from the release of intracellular potassium. Elevated serum creatinine (2.4 mg/dL) indicates AKI. Elevated serum myoglobin confirms muscle breakdown. EKG changes reflect hyperkalemia's effect on cardiac conduction.",
    "incorrect": "Intact skin is a negative finding, ruling out direct trauma as the primary cause of muscle damage. While the client's history of collapse is important context, it is not a direct clinical sign of rhabdomyolysis itself.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Early recognition and aggressive management are crucial in rhabdomyolysis to prevent AKI and life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. Monitor urine output closely. Continuous EKG monitoring is essential due to the risk of hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmias. The goal of treatment is to maintain a urine output of 200-300 mL/hr to flush myoglobin from the kidneys. Consider administering sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine, which can help prevent myoglobin precipitation in the renal tubules.",
    "questionTrap": "While myoglobinuria can cause a false positive for blood on a urine dipstick, the dark, tea-colored appearance of the urine is a more direct indicator of myoglobin presence. Focusing solely on the potential for a false positive could lead to overlooking the critical clinical sign.",
