Admitted with similar exacerbations in the past. Currently on pyridostigmine 60 mg PO Q4H.\n\n**Assessment:** At 07:15, patient reports increased generalized weakness, difficulty swallowing, and ptosis. Vital signs at 08:00: HR 58 bpm, RR 10 breaths/min and shallow, BP 90/60 mmHg, SpO2 92% on room air. Increased salivation and abdominal cramping noted. Breath sounds diminished bilaterally. Appears weak and fatigued.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediate notification of the healthcare provider is warranted due to signs of respiratory compromise and hemodynamic instability. Recommend edrophonium test to differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crisis. Prepare for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consider adjusting pyridostigmine dosage based on response to edrophonium test and clinical assessment."
