The patient's heart rate has increased from 82 bpm to 114 bpm over the last 4 hours. His current respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute. The latest blood pressure is 92/58 mmHg, which is a significant drop from his baseline of 140/88. The nurse notes that the patient is now confused and 'don't know where he is.' White blood cell count is 18.2 x 10^3/uL. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient last voided 50 mL in the past 6 hours.",
