  "passage": "A 75-year-old male is admitted for a suspected UTI. His medical history includes benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient's heart rate has increased from 82 bpm to 114 bpm over the last 4 hours. His current respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute. The latest blood pressure is 92/58 mmHg, which is a significant drop from his baseline of 140/88. The nurse notes that the patient is now confused and 'don't know where he is.' White blood cell count is 18.2 x 10^3/uL. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient last voided 50 mL in the past 6 hours.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate sepsis. Tachycardia (HR 114 bpm) suggests the body is attempting to compensate for decreased tissue perfusion. Tachypnea (RR 26) reflects the body's attempt to correct metabolic acidosis, a common consequence of sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia. Hypotension (92/58 mmHg) indicates vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance, hallmarks of septic shock. Altered mental status (confusion) signifies decreased cerebral perfusion. Leukocytosis (WBC 18.2 x 10^3/uL) indicates an active immune response to infection. Oliguria (50 mL in 6 hours) suggests decreased renal perfusion and potential kidney injury. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The inflammatory cascade leads to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and microvascular thrombosis, resulting in hypoperfusion and cellular hypoxia. Without prompt intervention, sepsis can progress to septic shock, characterized by profound hypotension and multi-organ failure.",
    "incorrect": "While the patient's age and history of BPH/COPD are relevant to overall health, they are not direct indicators of sepsis. An oxygen saturation of 94% on 2L is acceptable but should be monitored; however, it is less indicative of sepsis than the other highlighted findings. The primary concern is the constellation of signs pointing to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Focusing solely on oxygen saturation can distract from the more critical indicators of sepsis progression.",
