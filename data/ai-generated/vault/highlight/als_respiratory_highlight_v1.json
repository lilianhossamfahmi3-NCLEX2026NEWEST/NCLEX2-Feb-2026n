The client has [fasciculations] (muscle twitching) visible in the tongue and shoulders. The client reports [difficulty speaking] and their [voice is hoarse and weak]. During the assessment, the client has [difficulty managing oral secretions] and uses a [weak, ineffective cough]. The nurse observes [shallow chest expansion] and [accessory muscle use] during breathing. The client reports [trouble sleeping] while lying flat and [morning headaches]. An [arterial blood gas shows a PaCO2 of 52 mmHg].",

        "correct": "ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. Bulb involvement presents as dysarthria (speech difficulty), hoarseness, and dysphagia (difficulty with secretions). Weak cough, shallow breathing, and accessory muscle use are signs of respiratory muscle weakness. Orthopnea (trouble sleeping flat) and morning headaches (from nocturnal hypercapnia) are key indicators of impending respiratory failure. A PaCO2 of 52 mmHg (normal 35-45) confirms respiratory acidosis/hypoventilation.",
        "incorrect": "Arm/leg weakness and muscle wasting are characteristic of ALS but are part of the baseline progression rather than acute signs of respiratory compromise requested in the stem.",
        "clinicalPearls": "ALS does not affect mental status, sensory perception, or bowel/bladder control in its typical presentation. The client remains fully aware of their physical decline.",
