  "passage": "A 58-year-old client with a 2nd-year history of ALS is being assessed. The nurse notes [progressive weakness in the arms and legs] and [muscle wasting] in the hands. The client has [fasciculations] (muscle twitching) visible in the tongue and shoulders. The client reports [difficulty speaking] and their [voice is hoarse and weak]. During the assessment, the client has [difficulty managing oral secretions] and uses a [weak, ineffective cough]. The nurse observes [shallow chest expansion] and [accessory muscle use] during breathing. The client reports [trouble sleeping] while lying flat and [morning headaches]. An [arterial blood gas shows a PaCO2 of 52 mmHg].",

    "correct": "ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. The highlighted cues indicate respiratory compromise. **S (Situation):** 58-year-old with 2-year ALS history admitted for suspected respiratory infection. **B (Background):** ALS causes progressive motor neuron degeneration. Bulb involvement (cranial nerves) leads to dysarthria (speech difficulty), hoarseness, and dysphagia (difficulty managing secretions). **A (Assessment):** Weak cough, shallow breathing, and accessory muscle use indicate respiratory muscle weakness. Orthopnea (trouble sleeping flat) and morning headaches (from nocturnal hypercapnia) suggest impending respiratory failure. PaCO2 of 52 mmHg (normal 35-45 mmHg) confirms respiratory acidosis/hypoventilation. The elevated PaCO2 indicates that the client is not effectively eliminating carbon dioxide due to weakened respiratory muscles. This leads to a buildup of CO2 in the blood, causing respiratory acidosis. **R (Recommendation):** Immediate respiratory support (e.g., BiPAP, intubation) may be needed. Consult respiratory therapy and neurology. Monitor respiratory status closely.",
    "incorrect": "Arm/leg weakness and muscle wasting are characteristic of ALS but represent the baseline disease progression rather than acute signs of respiratory compromise. While important, they do not directly indicate the immediate respiratory distress focused on in the stem.",
    "clinicalPearls": "In ALS, cognitive function and sensory perception are typically preserved. Respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality. Early recognition and intervention are crucial. Proactive planning for ventilatory support is essential.",
    "questionTrap": "While general weakness is expected, the question focuses on cues specifically indicating *worsening* respiratory function. Morning headaches are a specific cue for nocturnal hypercapnia (high CO2) in clients with weakened respiratory muscles, indicating a significant decline.",
