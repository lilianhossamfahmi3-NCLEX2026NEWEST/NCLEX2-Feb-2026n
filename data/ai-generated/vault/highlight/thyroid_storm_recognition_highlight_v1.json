Following the stress of the accident, the nurse notes the patient's temperature has risen to 105.4°F (40.8°C). The patient's heart rate is 162 bpm with an irregular rhythm noted on the monitor. The patient appears extremely agitated and is shouting at staff members. Profuse diaphoresis is noted on the client's forehead and chest. The nurse notes the patient's blood pressure is 158/88 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose is 112 mg/dL. The patient reports having a bowel movement earlier today. The nurse notes a fine tremor in the client's outstretched hands.",
