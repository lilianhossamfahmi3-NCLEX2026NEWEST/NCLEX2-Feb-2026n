Following the stress of the accident, the nurse notes the patient's temperature has risen to 105.4°F (40.8°C). The patient's heart rate is 162 bpm with an irregular rhythm noted on the monitor. The patient appears extremely agitated and is shouting at staff members. Profuse diaphoresis is noted on the client's forehead and chest. The nurse notes the patient's blood pressure is 158/88 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose is 112 mg/dL. The patient reports having a bowel movement earlier today. The nurse notes a fine tremor in the client's outstretched hands.",

        "correct": "Thyroid storm, or thyrotoxic crisis, is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism triggered by a significant stressor. The pathophysiology involves an abrupt surge in thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), leading to a hypermetabolic state. This results in increased oxygen consumption, cardiac workload, and sympathetic nervous system activation. The classic signs include hyperpyrexia (temperature often exceeding 104°F/40°C), extreme tachycardia (heart rate >140 bpm, potentially with atrial fibrillation), altered mental status (agitation, delirium, psychosis), diaphoresis due to increased metabolic rate, and tremors resulting from heightened neuromuscular excitability. These findings reflect the body's overwhelmed attempt to compensate for the excessive thyroid hormone levels.",
        "incorrect": "While a blood pressure of 158/88 mmHg indicates hypertension, it's not as specific to thyroid storm as the other highlighted findings. The elevated blood pressure is a consequence of the hyperadrenergic state, but other conditions can cause similar elevations. A normal blood glucose of 112 mg/dL and a recent bowel movement are generally non-specific findings and do not contribute to the diagnosis of thyroid storm. These findings do not directly reflect the underlying pathophysiology of thyroid hormone excess.",

                "body": "The primary goals of treatment are to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis and release, block the effects of thyroid hormones on target tissues, and provide supportive care. Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, esmolol) are used to control heart rate and blood pressure. Anti-thyroid medications (e.g., propylthiouracil [PTU], methimazole) inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodide solutions (e.g., Lugol's solution, potassium iodide) block the release of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) can reduce T4 to T3 conversion and provide adrenal support. Cooling blankets and antipyretics are used to manage hyperpyrexia. Oxygen and intravenous fluids are administered to support oxygenation and hydration."

She was admitted earlier today for a hip fracture sustained in a motor vehicle accident.\nAssessment: 1405: The patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid storm, including hyperpyrexia (105.4°F/40.8°C), extreme tachycardia (162 bpm with irregular rhythm), agitation, diaphoresis, and fine tremors. These findings suggest a significant exacerbation of her hyperthyroidism, likely triggered by the stress of the trauma.\nRecommendation: 1410: I recommend initiating immediate treatment for thyroid storm. This includes administering beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) to control heart rate, anti-thyroid medications (PTU or Methimazole) to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and Lugol's solution to block thyroid hormone release. Implement cooling measures, such as cooling blankets, to manage the fever. Monitor vital signs closely, including continuous cardiac monitoring, and prepare for potential complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Consult with the endocrinologist STAT."
