    "correct": "The patient's blood glucose of 650 mg/dL indicates severe hyperglycemia requiring immediate intervention to reduce the glucose level and prevent further complications. Kussmaul respirations are a sign of metabolic acidosis, specifically DKA, and represent the body's attempt to compensate by blowing off CO2. A potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L indicates hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness; it must be corrected promptly.",
    "incorrect": "A heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated but expected in a patient experiencing DKA/HHS due to dehydration and stress. While it warrants monitoring, it is not the highest priority. Blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg is within acceptable limits, especially considering the patient is likely dehydrated. A urine output of 30 mL/hr is adequate, indicating sufficient renal perfusion. Although the patient is somnolent, the other findings are of greater immediate risk.",

      "DKA/HHS requires rapid assessment and correction of fluid deficits, electrolyte imbalances, and hyperglycemia.",

Patient is oriented to person only. \n\nLabs show elevated glucose and electrolyte imbalances. Respiratory pattern is abnormal. Vital signs are elevated with HR 110 bpm. Blood pressure is 110/70. Concerns for DKA or HHS. Requesting orders for fluid resuscitation, insulin drip, and electrolyte replacement. Need to correct acidosis and hyperglycemia quickly.
