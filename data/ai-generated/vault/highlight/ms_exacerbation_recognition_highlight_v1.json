The nurse notes the client has [scanning speech] and an [intentional tremor] when reaching for a pen. The client's [gait is ataxic] and they report feeling [extreme, disabling fatigue] despite getting 8 hours of sleep. The client reports a [shock-like sensation that travels down the spine] when they flex their neck. Physical exam reveals [hyperreflexia] and a [positive Babinski sign] on the left side. The client also mentions [new-onset urinary urgency] and [occasional incontinence].",

        "correct": "MS involves demyelination of the CNS. Optic neuritis (blurred vision/eye pain) is a common exacerbation symptom. Lhermitte's sign is the shock-like sensation on neck flexion. The Charcot Triad includes scanning speech, intentional tremor, and nystagmus (though nystagmus wasn't mentioned here). Ataxic gait, fatigue, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski (upper motor neuron signs) are common. Bladder dysfunction (urgency/incontinence) frequently occurs during flare-ups.",
