The client's heart rate is 122 bpm. Her blood pressure while lying flat is 108/62 mmHg, but it drops to 84/50 mmHg when she sits up. The nurse notes the client's skin is cool, pale, and clammy to the touch. Capillary refill time is 4 seconds in the fingernails. The client reports a pain level of 2 out of 10. The client's abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. The client appears restless and anxious.",
