  "passage": "A 52-year-old female presents to the emergency department at 1400 with a 3-day history of melena. She has a history of long-term NSAID use for chronic back pain. The client's heart rate is 122 bpm. Her blood pressure while lying flat is 108/62 mmHg, but it drops to 84/50 mmHg when she sits up. The nurse notes the client's skin is cool, pale, and clammy to the touch. Capillary refill time is 4 seconds in the fingernails. The client reports a pain level of 2 out of 10. The client's abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. The client appears restless and anxious.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings are indicative of hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is an early compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased blood volume. Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in systolic BP >20 mmHg or diastolic BP >10 mmHg upon standing) signifies significant intravascular volume depletion, impairing the body's ability to maintain blood pressure with positional changes. Cool, pale, and clammy skin results from peripheral vasoconstriction, shunting blood to vital organs. Prolonged capillary refill (4 seconds) indicates poor peripheral perfusion. Restlessness and anxiety are early signs of cerebral hypoxia due to decreased oxygen delivery to the brain. These findings collectively suggest the client is progressing towards decompensated shock.",
    "incorrect": "While a history of NSAID use is relevant to the etiology of the GI bleed, it doesn't directly indicate the severity of hypovolemic shock. A pain level of 2/10 is low and not indicative of shock. A soft, non-tender abdomen does not rule out a GI bleed but is not a direct indicator of hypovolemic shock. Waiting for the patient to be hypotensive while lying flat is a dangerous trap.",

        "body": "Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a significant reduction in intravascular volume, leading to decreased venous return, reduced preload, decreased cardiac output, and impaired tissue perfusion. The body attempts to compensate through increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and fluid retention. If the volume loss is severe or prolonged, compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and ultimately, death."
