    "passage": "A 24-year-old female is being evaluated for chronic fatigue and joint pain. The nurse observes a flat, red rash across the bridge of the patient's nose and cheeks. The client reports that the rash 'gets much worse' after she spends time in the sun. She also mentions having painful, swollen joints in her fingers and wrists that are worse in the morning. Physical exam reveals small, painless ulcers on the hard palate of the mouth. Laboratory results show a positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) titer. The client says she has always had regular menstrual cycles. Her heart rate is 78 bpm. She reports that she recently started a new job and is feeling stressed.",

        "correct": "The highlighted findings are characteristic of SLE. The malar rash (butterfly rash) is a classic symptom, resulting from immune complex deposition and inflammation in the skin. Photosensitivity, where the rash worsens with sun exposure, is another key indicator. Polyarthritis, particularly affecting small joints like fingers and wrists, is common due to inflammation of the synovial membranes. Oral ulcers, often painless, are another manifestation of SLE's inflammatory processes. A positive ANA titer indicates the presence of antinuclear antibodies, a hallmark of SLE, although it can be present in other autoimmune conditions. These antibodies attack the body's own cells, leading to widespread inflammation and tissue damage.",
        "incorrect": "Regular menstrual cycles and a heart rate of 78 bpm are within normal limits and do not suggest SLE. While stress can exacerbate SLE symptoms, it is not a diagnostic criterion. The client's recent job change and associated stress are important to note for holistic care but are not specific to SLE diagnosis.",

A diagnosis requires meeting a certain number of criteria from each category."

Exam reveals malar rash, photosensitivity, painful swollen joints, and oral ulcers. Positive ANA titer.\nAssessment: Findings consistent with SLE flare. Rule out infection or other exacerbating factors.\nRecommendation: Consult rheumatologist for possible medication adjustment. Educate patient on sun protection and stress management. Schedule follow-up appointment in 2 weeks."
