    "passage": "A 24-year-old female is being evaluated for chronic fatigue and joint pain. The nurse observes a flat, red rash across the bridge of the patient's nose and cheeks. The client reports that the rash 'gets much worse' after she spends time in the sun. She also mentions having painful, swollen joints in her fingers and wrists that are worse in the morning. Physical exam reveals small, painless ulcers on the hard palate of the mouth. Laboratory results show a positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) titer. The client says she has always had regular menstrual cycles. Her heart rate is 78 bpm. She reports that she recently started a new job and is feeling stressed.",
