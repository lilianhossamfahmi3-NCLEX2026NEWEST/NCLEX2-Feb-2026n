On assessment, the nurse observes [coffee-ground emesis], [melena], and [abdominal distension]. The patient's vital signs show [BP 90/60 mmHg], [HR 120 bpm], [RR 24 breaths/min], and [SpO2 92% on room air]. The patient also reports [severe epigastric pain].",

Orders received and initiated: IV access, fluid bolus, labs drawn (CBC, CMP, Coags), and type and crossmatch for possible transfusion.\n07:30 Patient remains hypotensive. Administered 500 mL NS bolus. Reassessing frequently. Oxygen initiated via nasal cannula at 2LPM.\n07:45 Patient reports increased dizziness. Repeat vital signs pending. Continue to monitor and document patient's response to interventions. Family notified of patient's status and plan of care."
