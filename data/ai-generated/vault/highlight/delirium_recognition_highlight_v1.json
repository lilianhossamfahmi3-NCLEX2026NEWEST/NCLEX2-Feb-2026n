    "passage": "An 88-year-old male was admitted two days ago for a hip fracture. The night shift nurse reports that the patient was 'fine at 20:00' but became suddenly agitated and confused at 02:00. The nurse notes that the patient's attention span is extremely short and he cannot follow a 1-step command. The patient claims there are 'large spiders' crawling on the walls, which are not present. His level of consciousness fluctuates between being drowsy and being hyper-alert. The patient's daughter states he has had mild memory problems for 3 years. The patient's heart rate is 98 bpm. The client's speech is garbled and incoherent at times.",
