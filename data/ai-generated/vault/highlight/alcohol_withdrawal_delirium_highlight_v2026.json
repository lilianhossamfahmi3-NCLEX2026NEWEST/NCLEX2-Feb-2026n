Currently exhibiting signs of withdrawal. A: Patient is increasingly agitated and confused. Vital signs: BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, Temp 99.5°F. Patient reports feeling anxious and tremulous. Administered lorazepam 2mg IV per protocol at 19:30. R: Requesting orders for further management of alcohol withdrawal, including potential need for increased sedation and monitoring for delirium tremens. Continuous vital sign monitoring recommended."
