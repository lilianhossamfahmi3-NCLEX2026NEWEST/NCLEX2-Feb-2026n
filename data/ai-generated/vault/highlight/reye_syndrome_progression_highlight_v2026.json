Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min with shallow breathing, Temp 38.9°C (102.0°F). 07:30 Notified Dr. Smith of changes in patient's condition. Orders received and implemented. Continuous monitoring initiated. 07:45 Continuing to monitor patient and assess neurological status. Family at bedside, provided education on Reye Syndrome and plan of care."
