Vital signs show a [rapidly rising temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F)], [blood pressure that is fluctuating] between 160/100 and 110/60, and a [heart rate of 132 beats/min]. The nurse observes [profuse diaphoresis]. The client is [stuporous] and [nonresponsive to verbal stimuli]. Laboratory results reveal a [marked elevation in creatine kinase (CK) level] and [leukocytosis] (high WBC count). The client also exhibits [tremors] and [incontinence].",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "NMS is a life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic drugs, particularly first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol, though it can occur with any antipsychotic. The pathophysiology involves dopamine blockade in the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and spinal cord, leading to muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. The dopamine blockade disrupts thermoregulation and muscle control. Classic cues include 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity (a sustained, uniform resistance to passive movement, unlike the intermittent clonus of serotonin syndrome), extreme hyperpyrexia (fever >40°C or 104°F), autonomic instability (fluctuating BP, tachycardia, diaphoresis), and altered mental status (stupor, coma). Laboratory findings include a markedly elevated CK (due to rhabdomyolysis from muscle rigidity) and leukocytosis (high WBCs, indicating systemic inflammation). Dysphagia and incontinence are also common due to neurological impairment.",
    "incorrect": "The diagnosis of schizophrenia and the use of haloperidol are the context/cause, not direct manifestations of NMS. While important for recognizing the risk, they are not the findings to highlight.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Immediate treatment includes stopping the antipsychotic immediately. Provide aggressive cooling (cooling blankets, ice packs), hydration (IV fluids), and supportive care. Medications like dantrolene (a direct-acting muscle relaxant that reduces muscle rigidity by interfering with calcium release in muscle cells) and bromocriptine (a dopamine agonist that counteracts the dopamine blockade) are often used. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, and death. Monitor for complications of rhabdomyolysis, such as acute kidney injury.",
    "questionTrap": "NMS = Rigidity + Fever + Haloperidol. Serotonin Syndrome = Clonus + Fever + SSRI. Be careful not to confuse NMS with serotonin syndrome, which presents with different neurological findings (clonus vs. rigidity).",
