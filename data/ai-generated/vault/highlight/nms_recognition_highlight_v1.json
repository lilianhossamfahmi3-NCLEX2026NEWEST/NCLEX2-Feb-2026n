The nurse observes [profuse diaphoresis]. The client is [stuporous] and [nonresponsive to verbal stimuli]. Laboratory results reveal a [marked elevation in creatine kinase (CK) level] and [leukocytosis] (high WBC count). The client also exhibits [tremors] and [incontinence].",

Classic cues include 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity (unlike the clonus of serotonin syndrome), extreme hyperpyrexia (fever >104°F), autonomic instability (fluctuating BP, tachycardia, diaphoresis), and altered mental status (stupor).
