    "passage": "A 70-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction is admitted with acute dyspnea. The patient reports having to sleep with 'three pillows' to breathe throughout the night. During the assessment, the patient develops a cough that produces frothy, pink-tinged sputum. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bibasilar crackles that do not clear with coughing. The patient's respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. The nurse notes the patient's skin is warm and dry. The patient's blood pressure is 148/94 mmHg. The client denies any swelling in his ankles or feet.",
