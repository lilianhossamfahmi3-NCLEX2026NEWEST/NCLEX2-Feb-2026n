            "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: Mr. Jones, a 42-year-old male, post-operative day 0, following ORIF of a tibia fracture sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Pain is currently rated 8/10 despite IV morphine 4mg administered at 13:30.\nBackground: The patient's surgical procedure was uneventful. He has a history of hypertension, controlled with lisinopril. Pre-operative neurovascular assessment of the affected extremity was within normal limits.\nAssessment: The patient reports increasing pain in the lower leg that is disproportionate to the injury and is not relieved by opioid medication. The patient also reports a tight, burning sensation in the affected leg. Pedal pulses are present but diminished compared to the unaffected side. The affected extremity is pale and cool to the touch. There is pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate evaluation for compartment syndrome, including intracompartmental pressure measurement. Consider emergent surgical fasciotomy if pressures are elevated.",
