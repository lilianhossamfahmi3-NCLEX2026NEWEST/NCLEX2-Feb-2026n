    "passage": "An 84-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and dementia is being evaluated during morning rounds. The staff reports the resident was 'unusually quiet' during breakfast. The nurse notes the resident is slumping in his chair and is difficult to arouse. He is pale and his skin feels cool and clammy. His heart rate is 108 bpm, and he is trembling slightly. The resident's daughter mentions he has a chronic history of macular degeneration. His blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg. The nurse notes a small bruise on his left arm.",
