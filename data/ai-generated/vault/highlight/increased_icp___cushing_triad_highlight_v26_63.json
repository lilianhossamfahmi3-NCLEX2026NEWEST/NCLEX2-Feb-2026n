He underwent emergent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation at 08:00 this morning.\nBackground: PMH includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with medications. Pre-op GCS was 15. Post-op, initial GCS was 13. He's been intubated and mechanically ventilated.\nAssessment: Neuro checks are being performed hourly. At 13:00, GCS was 10 (E2, VTi, M5). Pupils are now sluggish to respond to light. Right pupil is 4mm, left pupil is 3mm. The dressing is dry and intact with no noted CSF leak. Continuous heart rate monitoring, arterial line, and Foley catheter in place. IV fluids infusing at 75 mL/hr.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about a possible increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). I recommend a STAT neurosurgeon consult and possible repeat CT scan of the head. Consider increasing the current mannitol infusion rate.",
