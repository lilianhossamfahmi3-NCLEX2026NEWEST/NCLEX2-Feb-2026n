Auscultation of the heart reveals [muffled, distant heart sounds]. Vital signs show a [blood pressure of 88/64 mmHg] and a [heart rate of 128 beats/min]. The nurse notes a [narrowing pulse pressure] of 24 mmHg. When measuring the blood pressure, the [systolic pressure drops 14 mmHg during inspiration] (pulsus paradoxus). The client is [restless and reports a feeling of suffocation]. The [skin is pale and cool] with [delayed capillary refill].",

        "correct": "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening compression of the heart due to fluid or blood in the pericardium. Beck's Triad includes 1. Jugular Venous Distension (JVD). 2. Muffled heart sounds. 3. Hypotension. Sudden cessation of chest tube drainage often indicates the tube is blocked, causing blood to accumulate in the pericardial space. Narrowing pulse pressure, pulsus paradoxus (>10 mmHg drop in SBP on inspiration), and signs of cardiogenic shock (restlessness, cool/pale skin) are diagnostic cues.",
