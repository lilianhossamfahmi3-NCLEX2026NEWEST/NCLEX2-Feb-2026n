The nurse observes right-sided facial drooping when the patient tries to smile. The patient is able to follow simple commands but has slurred, garbled speech. When asked to hold up both arms, the right arm drifts downward within 5 seconds. The patient's blood pressure is 172/98 mmHg. The patient reports a history of chronic osteoarthritis in his knees. The patient appears confused about his current location.",
