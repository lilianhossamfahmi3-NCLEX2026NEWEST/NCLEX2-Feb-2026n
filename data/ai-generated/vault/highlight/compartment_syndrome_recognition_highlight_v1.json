The nurse notes that the pain [increases significantly when the toes are passively extended]. Physical assessment shows the [lower leg is tense and edematous] with [skin that is shiny and taut]. The client reports a [tingling sensation and numbness] (paresthesia) between the first and second toes. Upon palpation, the [pedal pulse is present but weak]. The client is [unable to wiggle their toes] on the affected side. The client's [toes appear pale] and [feel cool to the touch].",

The 6 Ps are: Pain (out of proportion to injury, distal to injury), Pressure (tense/edematous limb), Paresthesia (early sign), Pallor, Paralysis (late sign), and Pulselessness (very late sign). Pain with passive stretch is a highly sensitive early indicator. The fact that pain is not relieved by opioids is a major red flag. Paresthesia along a nerve distribution (between 1st/2nd toes) indicates nerve compression.",
