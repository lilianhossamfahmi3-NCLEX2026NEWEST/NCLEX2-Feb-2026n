    "correct": "Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency resulting from increased pressure within a confined space, typically a muscle compartment. This elevated pressure compromises blood flow, leading to ischemia and potential irreversible damage to nerves and muscles. The hallmark signs and symptoms, often remembered by the 6 Ps, are critical for early recognition. Pain out of proportion to the injury, especially with passive stretching of the affected muscles, is a key early indicator. This pain arises from the ischemic muscles being stretched. The fact that the pain is not relieved by opioid analgesics is a significant red flag, suggesting a problem beyond typical post-fracture pain. Paresthesia, or tingling and numbness, occurs due to nerve compression from the increased pressure. A tense and edematous limb, along with shiny and taut skin, indicates increased pressure within the compartment. Pallor and coolness of the toes suggest compromised arterial blood flow. Weakness or paralysis (inability to wiggle toes) is a later sign indicating muscle ischemia. A weak pedal pulse suggests compromised arterial flow, although its presence doesn't rule out compartment syndrome, as pressure may not be high enough to completely occlude the artery initially.",
    "incorrect": "The client's age and type of injury are context, not acute findings of the syndrome. While relevant to the overall clinical picture, they do not directly indicate the presence of compartment syndrome.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Never elevate a limb with suspected compartment syndrome above heart level, as this can further decrease arterial perfusion and exacerbate ischemia. The limb should be kept at heart level to optimize blood flow. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent permanent damage. Prepare the patient for possible fasciotomy.",
    "questionTrap": "Pulselessness is a VERY LATE sign of compartment syndrome. Relying solely on the absence of a pulse can lead to delayed diagnosis and irreversible tissue damage. Focus on the earlier signs like pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch, and paresthesia.",

    "situation": "At 1530, a 28-year-old client with a tibia fracture and a new cast is being assessed for potential complications.",
    "background": "The client sustained a crush injury to the lower leg, resulting in a tibia fracture and subsequent casting. The client is now reporting new and concerning symptoms.",
    "assessment": "Assessment findings at 1530 include: intense, deep-seated pain in the affected leg that is not relieved by morphine; pain significantly increases with passive extension of the toes; the lower leg is tense and edematous with shiny, taut skin; the client reports tingling and numbness (paresthesia) between the first and second toes; the pedal pulse is present but weak; the client is unable to wiggle their toes on the affected side; and the toes appear pale and feel cool to the touch. These findings are highly suggestive of compartment syndrome.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately notify the physician of the client's signs and symptoms indicative of compartment syndrome. Prepare the client for a possible fasciotomy to relieve pressure and restore blood flow to the affected limb. Maintain the affected limb at heart level and closely monitor neurovascular status, including pain, pulse, sensation, movement, and capillary refill, every 15 minutes. Anticipate orders for pain management and further diagnostic evaluation."
