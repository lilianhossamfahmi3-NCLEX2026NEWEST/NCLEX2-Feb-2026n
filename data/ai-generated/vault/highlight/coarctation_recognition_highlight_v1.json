    "correct": "Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) involves a narrowing of the aortic lumen, typically near the ductus arteriosus. This obstruction increases afterload proximal to the narrowing, leading to hypertension and bounding pulses in the upper extremities. Distal to the coarctation, blood flow is reduced, resulting in hypotension, weak or absent pulses, and cool, pale skin in the lower extremities. The increased pressure proximal to the narrowing can cause a systolic murmur, often heard best at the left infraclavicular area and radiating to the back due to turbulent blood flow. Tachypnea may occur as the body attempts to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Differential perfusion (flushed upper body, pale lower body) is a classic sign, reflecting the disparity in blood flow.",
