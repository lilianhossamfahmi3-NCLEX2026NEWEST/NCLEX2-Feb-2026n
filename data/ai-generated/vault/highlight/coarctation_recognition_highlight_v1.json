The nurse observes [skin that is pale and cool in the lower extremities]. Upon auscultation, a [systolic murmur is heard best at the left infraclavicular area] and [radiates to the back]. The newborn has [mild tachypnea] at 62 breaths/min. When the infant cries, the [upper body appears flushed] while the [lower body remains pale].",

        "correct": "Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta that restricts blood flow to the lower body. The hallmark includes high BP/bounding pulses in the upper extremities and low BP/weak pulses in the lower extremities. This leads to cooler, paler lower extremities. A systolic murmur radiating to the back is common. Flushed upper body versus pale lower body (differential cyanosis/perfusion) confirms the localized nature of the obstruction.",
