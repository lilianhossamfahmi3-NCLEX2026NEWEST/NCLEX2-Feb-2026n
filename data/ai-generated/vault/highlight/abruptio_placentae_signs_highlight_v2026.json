Prior pregnancies were uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. 14:10: A: Abdomen rigid and tender to palpation. Dark red vaginal bleeding noted. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows decelerations. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 24, O2 sat 94% RA. 14:15: R: Notify physician immediately regarding potential placental abruption. Anticipate orders for stat labs, IV fluids, and possible emergency C-section. Monitor fetal heart rate and maternal vital signs closely."
