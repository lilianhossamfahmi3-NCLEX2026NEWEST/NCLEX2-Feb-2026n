Auscultation reveals wheezing throughout all lung fields.\n07:30 Albuterol nebulizer treatment administered. Patient states minimal improvement. \n07:45 Noted increased work of breathing, patient using accessory muscles. Oxygen saturation decreasing. \n08:00 Second albuterol treatment administered with ipratropium. No significant improvement. \n08:15 Patient increasingly anxious and unable to speak in full sentences. Breath sounds now diminished in the left lower lobe. Vital signs trending downward. Preparing to notify the provider of patient's deteriorating condition. Requesting orders for further intervention and possible transfer to ICU."
