The client is prescribed digoxin 0.125 mg daily and phenytoin 100 mg three times daily. Upon assessment, the nurse notes [apical pulse of 52 bpm], [slurred speech], [nystagmus], [serum phenytoin level of 28 mcg/mL], [serum digoxin level of 2.5 ng/mL], and [BP 90/60 mmHg]. The client also reports [blurred vision] and [nausea]. The ECG shows [prolonged PR interval].",

A: Possible digoxin and phenytoin toxicity. Recent lab results pending. R: Requesting urgent evaluation due to bradycardia (HR 52), hypotension (BP 90/60), new-onset slurred speech, and nystagmus. ECG shows prolonged PR interval. Phenytoin level 28 mcg/mL, Digoxin level 2.5 ng/mL. Recommend holding both medications pending physician orders and further investigation. Monitor vital signs closely and assess for further neurological changes. Will update provider with any changes in condition. \n07:15 Notified Dr. Smith. Awaiting orders."
