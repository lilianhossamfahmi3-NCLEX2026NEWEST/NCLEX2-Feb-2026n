Auscultation reveals [coarse crackles bilaterally]. The client's vital signs show [a blood pressure of 90/58 mmHg], [a heart rate of 110 bpm], and [a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min]. The client reports [increased dyspnea] and [an inability to perform ADLs without significant fatigue].",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of acute respiratory failure secondary to a COPD exacerbation. Use of accessory muscles indicates increased work of breathing and respiratory distress. A blood pressure of 90/58 mmHg is indicative of hypotension, which can be a sign of hypoperfusion and impending shock. A heart rate of 110 bpm indicates tachycardia, likely a compensatory mechanism for hypoxia and hypotension. A respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min signifies tachypnea, a sign of respiratory distress and the body's attempt to compensate for inadequate oxygenation and CO2 removal. These findings require immediate notification of the healthcare provider for potential interventions, such as intubation or increased respiratory support.",
        "incorrect": "Productive cough with thick, yellow sputum is common in COPD exacerbations due to increased mucus production and possible infection, but does not require immediate notification unless accompanied by other critical findings. An oxygen saturation of 88% on 2L nasal cannula is within the acceptable range for COPD patients (88-92%), but the use of accessory muscles, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea are of greater concern. Coarse crackles bilaterally can be expected in COPD exacerbations due to increased secretions in the airways. Increased dyspnea and an inability to perform ADLs are expected findings in a COPD exacerbation, but do not require immediate notification on their own.",
