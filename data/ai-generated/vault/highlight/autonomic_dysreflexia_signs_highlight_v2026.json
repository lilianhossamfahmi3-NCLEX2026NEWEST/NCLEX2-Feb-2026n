        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency characterized by a sudden onset of excessively high blood pressure. It is most commonly seen in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. The body's normal feedback mechanisms to regulate blood pressure are disrupted, leading to an exaggerated response to stimuli below the level of the injury. Immediate notification of the healthcare provider is crucial to prevent severe complications such as stroke, seizure, or even death.",
        "incorrect": "While nasal congestion and anxiety can be associated with autonomic dysreflexia, they are less specific and do not warrant the same level of immediate concern as the other findings. Pale skin below the level of injury and a normal heart rate are not typical signs of autonomic dysreflexia and may indicate other issues.",
