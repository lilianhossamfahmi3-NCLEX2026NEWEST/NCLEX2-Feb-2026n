    "correct": "Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, occurring after 20 weeks gestation and before delivery. This separation disrupts oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus and can lead to maternal hemorrhage. The sudden onset of intense, sharp abdominal pain is due to uterine contractions and blood accumulating between the placenta and uterine wall, irritating nerve endings. Dark red vaginal bleeding occurs as blood escapes from the retroplacental space. A board-like, rigid uterus results from persistent uterine contractions and blood infiltration into the myometrium (Couvelaire uterus). Constant, dull back pain is referred pain from the uterine irritation. Uterine tenderness and failure to relax between contractions are caused by uterine muscle ischemia and irritation. Late decelerations and decreased variability on fetal heart rate monitoring indicate fetal hypoxia due to decreased placental perfusion. An increasing fundal height suggests concealed hemorrhage, where blood is accumulating behind the placenta. Maternal tachycardia (compensatory mechanism) and dropping blood pressure (hypovolemic shock) are due to blood loss.",
    "incorrect": "The gestation (34 weeks) and the unit are context and do not directly indicate abruptio placentae.",
    "clinicalPearls": "In suspected abruptio placentae, immediately assess maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, and uterine activity. Prepare for potential blood transfusions and emergency cesarean section. Time is critical to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes. SBAR: 0800: Client reports sudden onset of intense abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Uterus is rigid and tender. FHR shows late decelerations. BP 90/60, HR 120. Suspect abruptio placentae. Request immediate evaluation by OB physician.",
