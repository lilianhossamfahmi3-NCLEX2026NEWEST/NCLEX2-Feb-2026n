Palpation of the abdomen reveals that the [uterus is board-like and rigid]. The client reports [constant, dull back pain]. The nurse notes that the [uterus is tender to the touch] and [fails to relax between contractions]. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows [late decelerations] and [decreased variability]. The client's [fundal height has increased 2 cm] since a check 4 hours ago. Vital signs show [maternal tachycardia] and a [dropping blood pressure].",

        "correct": "Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta. Cues include sudden constant abdominal/back pain, dark red bleeding (if external), uterine rigidity ('board-like'), and uterine tenderness. Failure of the uterus to relax and fetal distress (late decels) are critical indicators. Increasing fundal height suggests occult (hidden) bleeding behind the placenta. Maternal tachycardia and hypotension indicate hypovolemic shock.",
