The client reports [severe epigastric pain] and [right upper quadrant tenderness]. The nurse notes [pitting edema of the face and hands]. Laboratory results show a [platelet count of 75,000/mm³] and [low hemoglobin and hematocrit] with evidence of [schistocytes on the blood smear]. Liver function tests reveal [elevated AST and ALT levels]. The [bilirubin level is elevated] at 1.8 mg/dL and the [LDH level is 850 U/L]. A urinalysis reveals [3+ proteinuria]. The client also reports [blurry vision] and a [persistent headache].",

    "correct": "HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets. \n\n*   **Hemolysis:** The breakdown of red blood cells leads to anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit) and the presence of schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) on a blood smear. This process also elevates bilirubin levels as hemoglobin is broken down, and LDH is released from damaged cells.\n*   **Elevated Liver Enzymes:** Liver damage causes the release of AST and ALT into the bloodstream, resulting in elevated levels. Right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain occurs due to distension of the liver capsule from swelling and inflammation.\n*   **Low Platelets:** Platelet consumption leads to thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mm³), increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\nProteinuria, blurry vision, and headache are indicative of the underlying severe preeclampsia, which often precedes HELLP syndrome. These findings reflect endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular permeability.",
    "incorrect": "The client's age and gestational age, while important for overall assessment, are not direct indicators of HELLP syndrome. They provide context but do not directly reflect the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, or low platelets that define the syndrome.",
    "clinicalPearls": "HELLP syndrome is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition and intervention. The definitive treatment is delivery of the fetus, regardless of gestational age, if the maternal condition is deteriorating. Corticosteroids may be administered to enhance fetal lung maturity if delivery is anticipated before 34 weeks gestation. Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis.",
    "questionTrap": "Epigastric or RUQ pain in a pregnant client with elevated blood pressure should always raise suspicion for HELLP syndrome or impending eclampsia (seizures). It should never be dismissed as simple heartburn, as it can indicate serious liver involvement.",
