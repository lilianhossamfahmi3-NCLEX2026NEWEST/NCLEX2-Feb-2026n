Laboratory results show a [platelet count of 75,000/mm³] and [low hemoglobin and hematocrit] with evidence of [schistocytes on the blood smear]. Liver function tests reveal [elevated AST and ALT levels]. The [bilirubin level is elevated] at 1.8 mg/dL and the [LDH level is 850 U/L]. A urinalysis reveals [3+ proteinuria]. The client also reports [blurry vision] and a [persistent headache].",
