Floaters and a curtain-like shadow are classic symptoms of retinal detachment, indicating the separation of the retina from the underlying choroid. Hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 110 bpm) suggest potential hypovolemia or shock, possibly related to anxiety or underlying physiological stress, which could compromise retinal perfusion. These symptoms necessitate urgent ophthalmological intervention to prevent permanent vision loss.",
