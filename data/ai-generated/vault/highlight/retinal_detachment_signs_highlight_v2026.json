He denies any recent trauma or previous eye conditions. Visual acuity was assessed at 14:15: OD 20/20, OS 20/70.\n**A**ssessment: Patient reports a shadow obscuring the upper portion of his left eye's visual field. He appears anxious, pale, and diaphoretic. Vital signs at 14:00: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 96% on room air. Pain is rated 0/10.\n**R**ecommendation: Ophthalmology has been notified. Orders received and initiated. Recommend immediate ophthalmological evaluation and potential surgical intervention. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen support should be maintained. Keep NPO pending further orders. Consider anxiety management strategies."
