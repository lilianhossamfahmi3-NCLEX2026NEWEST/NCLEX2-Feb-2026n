Patient states, 'I feel like I'm going to die.' B: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications include aspirin and atorvastatin. O: BP trending down (140/80 to 90/60), HR trending up (88 to 112 bpm and irregular), SpO2 dropping (98% to 90%). Requires immediate attention due to potential cardiogenic shock.
