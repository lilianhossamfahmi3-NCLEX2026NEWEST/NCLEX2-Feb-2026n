Elevated temperatures increase metabolic demand, oxygen consumption, and can exacerbate cardiovascular instability. Immediate interventions include administering antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), applying cooling measures (e.g., cooling blankets), and addressing the underlying infection with appropriate antibiotics.

However, sustained tachycardia increases myocardial workload and oxygen demand, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Interventions include addressing the underlying cause of shock (e.g., fluid resuscitation, vasopressors), monitoring cardiac rhythm, and assessing for signs of myocardial dysfunction. clinicalPearl: Persistent tachycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and impaired tissue perfusion. questionTrap: Do not assume tachycardia is always compensatory; evaluate its impact on cardiac function. mnemonic: RATE (Rapid HR, Assess perfusion, Treat cause, Evaluate rhythm)."

Hypotension results from vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance, leading to impaired oxygen delivery to vital organs. Immediate interventions include aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (e.g., normal saline) and, if hypotension persists, the administration of vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to increase systemic vascular resistance and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is crucial. clinicalPearl: Hypotension can rapidly progress to end-organ damage and death. questionTrap: Recognize that hypotension requires immediate action, even if other parameters seem stable. mnemonic: PRESS (Pressure low, Resuscitate fluids, Elevate MAP, Support with vasopressors)."

Elevated lactate levels indicate that cells are not receiving enough oxygen to meet their metabolic demands, leading to the production of lactic acid. Immediate interventions include optimizing oxygen delivery (e.g., supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation), improving tissue perfusion (e.g., fluid resuscitation, vasopressors), and addressing the underlying cause of hypoperfusion. Serial lactate measurements should be performed to assess the effectiveness of interventions. clinicalPearl: Elevated lactate is a strong predictor of mortality in septic shock. questionTrap: Do not ignore elevated lactate, even if vital signs appear stable. mnemonic: LACTATE (Lactate elevated, Assess perfusion, Correct hypoxemia, Treat underlying cause, Assess trends, Evaluate response)."

The focus should be on identifying and treating the source of infection with appropriate antibiotics. clinicalPearl: WBC count is a marker of infection but not a direct indicator of shock severity. questionTrap: Do not prioritize treating leukocytosis over addressing hemodynamic instability. mnemonic: WBC (White Blood Cells, Baseline marker, Consider trends)."

Interventions may include administering supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula, face mask), assessing for underlying respiratory issues (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary edema), and monitoring respiratory effort. If the patient exhibits signs of respiratory distress (e.g., increased work of breathing, cyanosis), more aggressive interventions (e.g., mechanical ventilation) may be necessary. clinicalPearl: Hypoxemia can exacerbate tissue hypoxia in septic shock. questionTrap: Do not overlook hypoxemia, especially in the context of impaired tissue perfusion. mnemonic: OXYGEN (Observe SpO2, X-ray prn, Give oxygen, Evaluate cause, Need for ventilation)."
