    "passage": "A 19-year-old college student presents with a history of fever and severe headache for 6 hours. The client's temperature is 103.2°F (39.6°C). The nurse notes that the client has a stiff neck and resists any attempt to flex the chin to the chest. When the nurse flexes the client's hip and knee to 90 degrees, the client experiences severe pain in the hamstring when extending the leg. The nurse also notes that the client's hips and knees flex involuntarily when her neck is flexed. A petechial rash is observed on the client's trunk and lower extremities. The client reports that the lights in the room are 'too bright.' The client's heart rate is 112 bpm.",
