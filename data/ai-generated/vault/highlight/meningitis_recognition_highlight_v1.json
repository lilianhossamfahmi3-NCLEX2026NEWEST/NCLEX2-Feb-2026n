    "passage": "A 19-year-old college student presents with a history of fever and severe headache for 6 hours. The client's temperature is 103.2°F (39.6°C). The nurse notes that the client has a stiff neck and resists any attempt to flex the chin to the chest. When the nurse flexes the client's hip and knee to 90 degrees, the client experiences severe pain in the hamstring when extending the leg. The nurse also notes that the client's hips and knees flex involuntarily when her neck is flexed. A petechial rash is observed on the client's trunk and lower extremities. The client reports that the lights in the room are 'too bright.' The client's heart rate is 112 bpm.",

        "correct": "Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The classic triad includes fever, nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), and altered mental status (though not explicitly stated here, photophobia suggests neurological involvement). Kernig's sign (hamstring pain on leg extension) and Brudzinski's sign (involuntary hip/knee flexion with neck flexion) indicate meningeal irritation. A petechial rash is observed on the client's trunk and lower extremities, suggesting meningococcemia, a severe complication often caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*. The inflammatory process increases intracranial pressure, leading to headache and photophobia.",
        "incorrect": "While fever (103.2°F) and tachycardia (112 bpm) are systemic signs of infection, they are not specific to meningitis. They indicate the body's response to infection but do not pinpoint the meninges as the primary site. Meningitis is diagnosed by assessing for meningeal irritation and confirmed with lumbar puncture.",

STAT notify the provider and prepare for lumbar puncture to confirm diagnosis. Anticipate orders for IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, vancomycin) and supportive care (e.g., IV fluids, pain management). Monitor neurological status closely."
