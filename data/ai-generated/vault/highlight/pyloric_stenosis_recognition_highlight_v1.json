  "passage": "A 6-week-old male infant is evaluated for a 1-week history of vomiting. The mother describes the vomiting as 'shooting across the room' and occurring immediately after every feeding. The nurse observes that the infant appears 'always hungry' and readily takes a bottle during the exam. Upon palpation of the epigastrium, the nurse feels a firm, olive-shaped mass. Visible peristaltic waves are seen moving from left to right across the upper abdomen. The infant's stool is described as 'soft and yellow,' and he has no fever. Laboratory results show a state of metabolic alkalosis. The infant's heart rate is 148 bpm. The mother reports the infant is breastfed and supplemented with formula.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings are indicative of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). Projectile vomiting occurs due to the thickened pylorus obstructing gastric emptying. The infant's persistent hunger reflects the inability to effectively digest and absorb nutrients. Palpation of an olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium is a classic sign, representing the hypertrophied pyloric muscle. Visible peristaltic waves result from the stomach's forceful contractions attempting to overcome the pyloric obstruction. Metabolic alkalosis develops due to the loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl) from frequent vomiting.",
    "incorrect": "Normal stool, absence of fever, heart rate, and feeding history are not specific indicators of HPS. While these findings are part of the overall assessment, they do not directly point to the underlying pathophysiology of pyloric stenosis.",

        "heading": "Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis",
        "body": "HPS is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, leading to narrowing of the pyloric canal and obstruction of gastric outflow. This typically presents between 3-6 weeks of age. The etiology is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The resulting obstruction leads to forceful vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis), and potential failure to thrive. Diagnosis is confirmed by physical examination (palpable olive-shaped mass) and abdominal ultrasound. Treatment involves surgical correction via pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt procedure), which involves incising the pyloric muscle to relieve the obstruction. Pre-operative management focuses on correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances with IV fluids (e.g., normal saline with potassium supplementation) and NPO status. Post-operative care includes gradual reintroduction of feedings, monitoring for complications such as infection or wound dehiscence, and parent education on feeding techniques and signs of recurrence."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Remember the classic presentation: projectile vomiting, palpable olive-shaped mass, visible peristalsis, and 'always hungry' infant. Always prioritize fluid and electrolyte correction before surgical intervention. Monitor for signs of dehydration (sunken fontanelles, decreased urine output) and electrolyte imbalances (lethargy, muscle weakness). Educate parents on proper feeding techniques post-operatively to prevent vomiting and promote weight gain. SBAR: Situation: 6-week-old male infant with projectile vomiting. Background: 1-week history of vomiting after each feeding, appears hungry. Assessment: Palpable olive-shaped mass in epigastrium, visible peristaltic waves, metabolic alkalosis. HR 148 bpm. Recommendation: Consult pediatric surgeon for pyloromyotomy. Monitor electrolytes and hydration status. NPO."
