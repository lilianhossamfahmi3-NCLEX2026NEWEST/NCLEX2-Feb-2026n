    "passage": "A 6-week-old male infant is evaluated for a 1-week history of vomiting. The mother describes the vomiting as 'shooting across the room' and occurring immediately after every feeding. The nurse observes that the infant appears 'always hungry' and readily takes a bottle during the exam. Upon palpation of the epigastrium, the nurse feels a firm, olive-shaped mass. Visible peristaltic waves are seen moving from left to right across the upper abdomen. The infant's stool is described as 'soft and yellow,' and he has no fever. Laboratory results show a state of metabolic alkalosis. The infant's heart rate is 148 bpm. The mother reports the infant is breastfed and supplemented with formula.",
