The client states she also feels 'a bit nauseous' and has vomited twice this morning. She describes a 'dull, heavy sensation' in her epigastric area that feels like 'bad indigestion.' The nurse notes the client's skin is pale and she is diaphoretic. The client denies any sharp, crushing chest pain. Her heart rate is 104 bpm and her blood pressure is 114/76 mmHg. She reports feeling lightheaded when she stands up.",

        "correct": "Women, elderly individuals, and those with diabetes often present with atypical MI symptoms. Extreme fatigue, nausea/vomiting, epigastric pain (often mistaken for GERD), and diaphoresis are common. Lightheadedness (syncope) can also be a presenting sign due to decreased cardiac output. These symptoms reflect the body's response to myocardial ischemia, including autonomic nervous system activation and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.",
        "incorrect": "A history of diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for MI, but not acute diagnostic cues. The absence of 'crushing chest pain' is a common distractor; many women do not experience the classic presentation. Focusing solely on chest pain can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Elevated heart rate and blood pressure changes, while present, are less specific than the highlighted cues.",
