The client states she also feels 'a bit nauseous' and has vomited twice this morning. She describes a 'dull, heavy sensation' in her epigastric area that feels like 'bad indigestion.' The nurse notes the client's skin is pale and she is diaphoretic. The client denies any sharp, crushing chest pain. Her heart rate is 104 bpm and her blood pressure is 114/76 mmHg. She reports feeling lightheaded when she stands up.",
