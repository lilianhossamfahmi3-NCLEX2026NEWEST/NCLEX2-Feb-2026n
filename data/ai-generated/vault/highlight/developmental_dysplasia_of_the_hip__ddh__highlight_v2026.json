Has been irritable, especially during diaper changes. Mother reports difficulty positioning infant comfortably.\nAssessment: Unequal leg lengths and asymmetrical thigh creases noted. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 160, RR 50 with mild intercostal retractions, SpO2 92% on room air. Infant difficult to console, possible pain. \nRecommendation: Recommend urgent assessment by provider due to respiratory distress and hypotension. Consider pain management strategies."
