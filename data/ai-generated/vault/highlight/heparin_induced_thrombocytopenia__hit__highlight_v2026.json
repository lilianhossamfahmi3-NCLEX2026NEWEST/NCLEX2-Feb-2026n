Background: History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. No known allergies. Assessment: Patient reports new onset shortness of breath and chest pain this morning. Noted petechiae on chest. Platelet count significantly decreased since admission. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 28, SpO2 90% on room air. Recommendation: STAT order for protamine sulfate, discontinue heparin, and consult hematology. Further investigation for HIT is warranted."
