He became increasingly confused overnight. 06:00 assessment revealed asterixis and mild jaundice. The patient is currently oriented to person only. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 37.9°C. Ammonia level is elevated per recent labs. Lactulose was administered at 06:30. I am concerned about his declining mental status and hypotension. Requesting orders for possible fluid bolus and further evaluation of encephalopathy. The patient is at risk for falls due to confusion."

    "correct": "Asterixis, elevated ammonia level, occasional confusion, and hypotension (BP 90/60) are all critical findings in a client with hepatic encephalopathy. Asterixis and confusion indicate worsening encephalopathy. Elevated ammonia levels directly contribute to the neurological symptoms. Hypotension can indicate hypovolemia or sepsis, both of which can exacerbate liver failure and encephalopathy. These findings require immediate notification to the healthcare provider for potential interventions such as fluid resuscitation, medication adjustments, or further diagnostic testing.",

Normal bowel sounds do not indicate any acute deterioration. Being alert and oriented x3 indicates some level of cognitive function is intact, and does not indicate an acute change. Jaundice is expected in liver failure and is not an acute finding requiring immediate intervention.
