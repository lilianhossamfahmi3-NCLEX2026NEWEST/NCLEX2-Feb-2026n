Patient reports severe headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations. 07:15 Initial BP 210/120 mmHg, HR 120 bpm. Phentolamine administered per protocol. 07:30 BP trending down, now 150/90 mmHg, HR 100 bpm. Patient reports blurred vision and increased anxiety. 07:45 BP now 90/60 mmHg, HR 60 bpm. Notified provider of rapid BP decrease. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status closely. Patient is now at risk for hypotension. 08:00 BP stable at 95/65 mmHg, HR 65 bpm. Provider orders to hold further phentolamine doses and administer IV fluids."
