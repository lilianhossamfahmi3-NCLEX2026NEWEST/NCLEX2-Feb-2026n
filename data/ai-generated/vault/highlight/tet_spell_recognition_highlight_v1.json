The infant's [respiratory rate increases to 68 breaths/min] and [respirations appear labored]. The nurse observes the infant is [increasingly irritable] and then [suddenly becomes limp and unresponsive]. Analysis of the heart sounds shows a [systolic murmur that has decreased in intensity] compared to the previous assessment. The infant [spontaneously pulls their knees up to their chest]. A pulse oximeter shows a [saturation of 62%] which was previously 82%.",

        "correct": "Hypercyanotic spells (Tet spells) occur in Tetralogy of Fallot due to an acute decrease in pulmonary blood flow. Cues include sudden inconsolable crying/irritability, worsening cyanosis (blue spells), tachypnea (rapid breathing), and potential loss of consciousness/lethargy if the hypoxia is severe. Interestingly, the murmur often softens or disappears during a spell as blood bypasses the pulmonary valve entirely. The knee-chest position is a compensatory maneuver that increases systemic vascular resistance and forces more blood into the lungs.",
        "incorrect": "The age of the infant and the fact they are being fed are triggers or context, not assessment findings of the spell itself.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The immediate nursing action for a Tet spell is placing the infant in the knee-chest position, followed by oxygen, morphine, and IV fluids.",
        "questionTrap": "The murmur decreases in intensity during a spell because the right-to-left shunting increases, reducing the flow across the stenotic pulmonary valve.",
