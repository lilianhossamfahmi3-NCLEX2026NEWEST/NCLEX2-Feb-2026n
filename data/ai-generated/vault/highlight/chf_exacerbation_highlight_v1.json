Physical exam reveals bilateral 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Lung auscultation shows crackles in the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 152/94 mmHg, Heart Rate is 112 bpm, and SpO2 is 89% on room air. He normally takes Lisinopril 10mg daily. The patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe.",
