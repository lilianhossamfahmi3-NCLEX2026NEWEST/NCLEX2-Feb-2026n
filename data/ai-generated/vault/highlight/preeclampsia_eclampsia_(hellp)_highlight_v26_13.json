Her blood pressure has been consistently elevated, despite initial magnesium sulfate bolus. \nBackground: Ms. Doe has a history of well-controlled gestational hypertension in her previous pregnancy. This pregnancy was uncomplicated until two days ago when she presented to her OB clinic with elevated BP and proteinuria. Outpatient management failed, and she was referred for admission.\nAssessment: The patient is currently alert and oriented. Her blood pressure is 168/112 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, respirations are 24 breaths/min, and temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F). She is complaining of severe headache, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant pain. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with 2 beats of clonus bilaterally. Fetal heart rate is 140 bpm with moderate variability.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about the possibility of HELLP syndrome given her symptoms, elevated blood pressure, and lab results. I recommend further evaluation for HELLP syndrome, including repeat lab draws and consideration for delivery.",
