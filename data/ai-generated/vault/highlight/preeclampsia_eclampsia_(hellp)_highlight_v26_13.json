This pregnancy was uncomplicated until two days ago when she presented to her OB clinic with elevated BP and proteinuria. Outpatient management failed, and she was admitted.\nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented. BP is 168/112 mmHg, HR is 110 bpm, RR is 24 breaths/min, and Temp is 38.2°C (100.8°F). She complains of a severe headache, visual disturbances, and RUQ pain. DTRs are 3+ with 2 beats of clonus bilaterally. FHR is 140 bpm with moderate variability.\nRecommendation: I'm concerned about HELLP syndrome given her symptoms, elevated BP, and lab results. I recommend further evaluation for HELLP, including repeat labs and considering delivery.",
