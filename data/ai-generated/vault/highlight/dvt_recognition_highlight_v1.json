  "passage": "A 72-year-old male is recovering from a right total hip arthroplasty performed 48 hours ago. He has been on bed rest since surgery due to pain. The nurse notes that the patient's right calf is 2 cm larger in circumference than the left calf. The right lower extremity is warm to the touch and appears slightly erythematous. The patient reports a 'heavy, aching pain' in the right leg when he tries to flex his foot. A small amount of serosanguinous drainage is noted on the surgical dressing. The patient's pedal pulses are 2+ bilaterally. The patient's heart rate is 88 bpm.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings are indicative of a DVT. A calf circumference difference of ≥2 cm suggests unilateral edema, a key sign of DVT. Warmth and erythema in the affected extremity result from inflammation and increased blood flow due to the thrombus. Pain, especially exacerbated by dorsiflexion, arises from venous distension and inflammation irritating nerve endings. These findings, in the context of post-operative immobility, strongly suggest DVT.",
    "incorrect": "Prolonged bed rest post-surgery is a risk factor for DVT development but not a direct diagnostic cue. Serosanguinous drainage is expected in the immediate post-operative period. Bilaterally equal pedal pulses and a heart rate of 88 bpm are within normal limits and do not suggest DVT. These findings do not rule out DVT but are not specific indicators.",

        "heading": "DVT Pathophysiology",
        "body": "DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs. Virchow's triad (stasis, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability) contributes to thrombus formation. Post-operative patients are at increased risk due to immobility (stasis), surgical trauma (endothelial injury), and potential hypercoagulable states. The clot obstructs venous return, leading to increased pressure, edema, inflammation, and pain. If the clot dislodges, it can travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE)."

      "While Homan's sign (pain on dorsiflexion) is a classic sign, it's unreliable and not recommended due to low sensitivity and the risk of dislodging the clot. Rely on objective findings like calf circumference and warmth. Early ambulation and prophylactic anticoagulation are crucial for DVT prevention in post-operative patients.",
      "Always compare bilateral extremities when assessing for DVT. A unilateral finding is more concerning than bilateral findings.",
      "Use SBAR to communicate concerns to the healthcare provider. Include vital signs, assessment findings, and specific recommendations. For example: 'Dr. Smith, this is Nurse Jones calling from Med-Surg regarding Mr. Johnson in room 302. He is post-op day 2 from a total hip replacement. I'm concerned he may have a DVT. His right calf is 2 cm larger than his left, it's warm and erythematous, and he reports pain with dorsiflexion. His vital signs are stable. I recommend a Doppler ultrasound to rule out DVT.'"
