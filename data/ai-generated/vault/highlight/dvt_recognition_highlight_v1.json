    "passage": "A 72-year-old male is recovering from a right total hip arthroplasty performed 48 hours ago. He has been on bed rest since surgery due to pain. The nurse notes that the patient's right calf is 2 cm larger in circumference than the left calf. The right lower extremity is warm to the touch and appears slightly erythematous. The patient reports a 'heavy, aching pain' in the right leg when he tries to flex his foot. A small amount of serosanguinous drainage is noted on the surgical dressing. The patient's pedal pulses are 2+ bilaterally. The patient's heart rate is 88 bpm.",
