During these episodes, the client experiences [profuse diaphoresis] and [palpitations]. The nurse observes that the client is [visibly tremulous] and [extremely anxious]. Physical assessment during an episode shows a [blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg] and a [heart rate of 128 beats/min]. The client also reports experiencing [chest pain] and [pallor of the face] during the height of the symptoms. A review of the client's home medications shows they are taking [nothing except occasional ibuprofen].",

    "correct": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine-secreting tumor typically found in the adrenal medulla. This tumor leads to the excessive release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in a 'fight-or-flight' response. The classic triad includes severe, pounding headache, profuse diaphoresis, and palpitations. The hypertension (210/115 mmHg) and tachycardia (128 bpm) are due to the vasoconstrictive and chronotropic effects of catecholamines. Tremors and anxiety result from increased sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Chest pain can occur due to myocardial oxygen demand exceeding supply from increased heart rate and blood pressure. Pallor results from peripheral vasoconstriction. The absence of other medications suggests the symptoms are not medication-induced.",
    "incorrect": "The client's age and ibuprofen use are not specific indicators of pheochromocytoma. While hypertension is common, the constellation of symptoms is key.",
    "clinicalPearls": "During a hypertensive crisis (e.g., BP > 180/120 mmHg), immediately implement interventions such as administering alpha-adrenergic blockers (e.g., phentolamine) to counteract the effects of excessive catecholamines. Monitor BP every 5-15 minutes. Avoid palpating the abdomen in suspected cases to prevent catecholamine release.",
    "questionTrap": "While hypertension is common, the *episodic* nature combined with the classic triad is highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. The headache is characteristically severe and pounding due to the rapid increase in blood pressure.",

Norepinephrine primarily affects alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. The episodic nature of symptoms reflects the intermittent release of catecholamines from the tumor."
