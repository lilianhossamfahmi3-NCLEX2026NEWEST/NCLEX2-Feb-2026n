During these episodes, the client experiences [profuse diaphoresis] and [palpitations]. The nurse observes that the client is [visibly tremulous] and [extremely anxious]. Physical assessment during an episode shows a [blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg] and a [heart rate of 128 beats/min]. The client also reports experiencing [chest pain] and [pallor of the face] during the height of the symptoms. A review of the client's home medications shows they are taking [nothing except occasional ibuprofen].",

        "correct": "Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla. The classic triad includes headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Severe hypertension (210/115) and tachycardia (128) are common. Tremors, anxiety, chest pain, and pallor are also reflective of excess epinephrine and norepinephrine. The mention of taking no other medications (like decongestants or cocaine) helps rule out other causes of sympathetic surge.",
