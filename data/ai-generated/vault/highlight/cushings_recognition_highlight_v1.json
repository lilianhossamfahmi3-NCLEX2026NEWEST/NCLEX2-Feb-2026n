        "correct": "Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged exposure to excessive glucocorticoids, most commonly cortisol. The highlighted findings are classic manifestations. 'Moon face' (rounding of the facial profile) occurs due to fat redistribution. A 'buffalo hump' (prominent fat pad on the upper back) is another sign of altered fat metabolism. Truncal obesity (protuberant abdomen) with wide, purple striae results from increased fat deposition and thinning of the skin. Thin, translucent skin and ecchymoses (easy bruising) are due to cortisol's catabolic effect on collagen. Hypertension (BP 158/94 mmHg) is caused by cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects, leading to sodium and water retention. Muscle weakness, particularly in the extremities, results from protein catabolism. Hirsutism (excessive facial hair growth) in women is due to increased androgen production. Hyperglycemia (142 mg/dL) occurs because cortisol antagonizes insulin.",
        "incorrect": "The client's age, sex, and history of lupus/prednisone use provide context for the Cushing's syndrome but are not direct physical assessment findings. These details are important for understanding the etiology but should not be highlighted as signs of the syndrome itself.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, caused by long-term corticosteroid use, is the most prevalent form. Differentiating between Cushing's syndrome (any cause of hypercortisolism) and Cushing's disease (specifically caused by a pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH) is crucial for diagnosis and management. SBAR: Situation: 38-year-old female with SLE on high-dose prednisone presenting with signs of hypercortisolism. Background: Long-term prednisone use. Assessment: Moon face, buffalo hump, truncal obesity with purple striae, thin skin with ecchymoses, BP 158/94, muscle weakness, hirsutism, BG 142. Recommendation: Further endocrine evaluation to assess cortisol levels and potential need for medication adjustment.",
        "questionTrap": "Striae associated with Cushing's syndrome are typically wide and purple due to skin thinning and increased capillary fragility, distinguishing them from the silvery/white striae seen in pregnancy or weight gain.",

These findings are highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, likely iatrogenic due to prednisone use.\nRecommendation: Recommend further endocrine evaluation to assess serum cortisol levels, ACTH levels, and consider imaging studies (e.g., MRI of the pituitary) to rule out other causes. Consult with the physician regarding potential adjustments to the prednisone dosage, if clinically appropriate, to minimize further complications."
