No known allergies.\n07:02 A: Patient reports pain as 10/10, described as 'tearing' sensation radiating to his back. Appears anxious and diaphoretic. Noted unequal radial pulses; weaker on the right. BP right arm 90/60, left arm 140/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air. ECG in progress. \n07:03 R: Aortic dissection suspected due to presentation and vital sign discrepancies. Requesting immediate physician evaluation and orders for stat CT angiography and pain management. Consider labetalol IV for blood pressure control. Monitoring vital signs closely."
