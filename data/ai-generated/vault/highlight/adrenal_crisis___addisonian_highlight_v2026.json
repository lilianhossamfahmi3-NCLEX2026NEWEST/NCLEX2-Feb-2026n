The nurse's assessment reveals [acute confusion], [weakness], [dizziness], and [nausea]. The client's vital signs show [BP 90/60 mmHg], [HR 110 bpm], [RR 24 breaths/min], and [SpO2 92% on room air]. The client appears [pale and diaphoretic].",

O: Pt reports increasing fatigue over the past week and has been unable to keep food down. A: Suspect adrenal crisis. Noted hypotension (90/60), tachycardia (110), tachypnea (24), and SpO2 92% on RA. Pt is pale and diaphoretic. B: Provider notified. Anticipating fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone administration. Monitor vital signs closely. Repeat labs per order. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Assess mental status frequently. Educate patient and family about Addison's disease management and prevention of adrenal crisis. 07:15: Placed on telemetry; awaiting provider orders."
