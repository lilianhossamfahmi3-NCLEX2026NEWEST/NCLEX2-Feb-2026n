The nurse observes visible pulsation of the jugular veins when the patient is sitting at a 45-degree angle. Upon palpation of the abdomen, the nurse notes the liver edge is felt 4 cm below the costal margin and is tender. The patient's lower extremities show 3+ pitting edema extending to the mid-calf. The patient reports her 'rings feel tight' and she has gained 6 lbs in the last week. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's heart rate is 92 bpm.",
