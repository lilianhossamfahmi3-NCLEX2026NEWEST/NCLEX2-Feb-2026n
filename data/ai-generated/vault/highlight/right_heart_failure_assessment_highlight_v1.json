    "passage": "A 68-year-old female with a history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension was admitted at 0800 for worsening peripheral edema. The nurse observes visible pulsation of the jugular veins when the patient is sitting at a 45-degree angle. Upon palpation of the abdomen, the nurse notes the liver edge is felt 4 cm below the costal margin and is tender. The patient's lower extremities show 3+ pitting edema extending to the mid-calf. The patient reports her 'rings feel tight' and she has gained 6 lbs in the last week. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's heart rate is 92 bpm and blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. The patient denies chest pain but reports increasing shortness of breath with minimal exertion.",

        "correct": "Right-sided heart failure (often caused by cor pulmonale in COPD) results in systemic venous congestion. Key findings include: Jugular Venous Distension (JVD) due to increased central venous pressure, hepatomegaly (enlarged, tender liver) from hepatic congestion, peripheral edema (3+ pitting edema extending to the mid-calf) due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, and rapid weight gain/tight jewelry reflecting fluid retention. These findings indicate the heart's inability to effectively pump blood to the lungs, leading to a backup of blood in the systemic circulation.",
        "incorrect": "Clear breath sounds bilaterally are more characteristic of *isolated* right heart failure; crackles would suggest left heart failure or pulmonary congestion. A heart rate of 92 bpm and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg are within acceptable limits for this patient and do not directly indicate worsening right heart failure. While shortness of breath can occur, it is not a primary indicator of right heart failure in this context.",
