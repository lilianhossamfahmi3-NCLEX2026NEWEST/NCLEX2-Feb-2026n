Vital signs reveal a [blood pressure of 74/42 mmHg] and a [heart rate of 122 beats/min]. The client is [febrile with a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F)]. Lab results show a [serum sodium of 128 mEq/L], [serum potassium of 6.2 mEq/L], and [serum glucose of 3.2 mmol/L (58 mg/dL)]. The client reports [intense pain in the lower back and legs]. The nurse also notes [hyperpigmentation of the skin] and [syncopal episodes] during attempted position changes.",

        "correct": "Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening emergency resulting from acute adrenal insufficiency, characterized by a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone. The pathophysiology involves a cascade of events due to the lack of these hormones. Cortisol deficiency leads to impaired glucose regulation, decreased vascular tone, and reduced stress response. Aldosterone deficiency causes sodium and water loss, leading to hypovolemia and hyperkalemia.\n\n*   **Dehydration and Obtundation:** Result from severe fluid loss due to aldosterone deficiency and vomiting/diarrhea. Hypovolemia reduces cerebral perfusion, leading to altered mental status.\n*   **Hypotension (74/42 mmHg) and Tachycardia (122 bpm):** Indicate hypovolemic shock. The body attempts to compensate for decreased blood volume by increasing heart rate. Reduced cortisol impairs vascular tone, exacerbating hypotension.\n*   **Fever (38.6°C/101.4°F):** Can occur due to impaired immune function and inflammatory response associated with cortisol deficiency. It can also be present even without infection due to the body's inability to regulate temperature properly.\n*   **Hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), Hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L), and Hypoglycemia (3.2 mmol/L/58 mg/dL):** Electrolyte imbalances are hallmark signs. Aldosterone deficiency causes sodium excretion and potassium retention. Cortisol deficiency impairs gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia.\n*   **Back and Leg Pain:** Thought to be related to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and possibly muscle ischemia due to poor perfusion.\n*   **Hyperpigmentation:** Occurs due to increased ACTH production (in primary adrenal insufficiency) stimulating melanocytes.\n*   **Syncope:** Results from orthostatic hypotension due to hypovolemia and impaired vasoconstriction.",
        "incorrect": "The history of vomiting and diarrhea are precipitating factors but not direct indicators of the crisis itself. While important for context, they don't represent the physiological manifestations of adrenal insufficiency.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In Addisonian crisis, prioritize rapid fluid resuscitation with normal saline and IV hydrocortisone administration. Monitor electrolytes and glucose closely. Educate patients with Addison's disease about stress dosing of glucocorticoids during illness or surgery. Consider fludrocortisone for long-term management of mineralocorticoid deficiency.",
        "questionTrap": "Hyperpigmentation is more prominent in primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) due to elevated ACTH levels. Its presence doesn't rule out secondary adrenal insufficiency but is less common.",
