Lab results show a [serum sodium of 128 mEq/L], [serum potassium of 6.2 mEq/L], and [serum glucose of 58 mg/dL]. The client reports [intense pain in the lower back and legs]. The nurse also notes [hyperpigmentation of the skin] and [syncopal episodes] during attempted position changes.",

        "correct": "Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening emergency caused by acute adrenal insufficiency. Dehydration and mental status changes (obtunded) are common. Severe hypotension (74/42) and tachycardia are signs of shock. Fever can occur during crisis even without infection. Classic electrolyte patterns include hyponatremia (128), hyperkalemia (6.2), and hypoglycemia (58). Acute pain in the back/legs is a known but often overlooked sign of crisis. Hyperpigmentation (bronzing) is a sign of chronic Addison's while syncope indicates orthostatic hypotension/shock.",
