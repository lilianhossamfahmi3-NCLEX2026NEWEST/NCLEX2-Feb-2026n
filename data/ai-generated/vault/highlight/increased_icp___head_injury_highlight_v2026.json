Initial GCS was 15.\nBackground: Patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. No known allergies. He was found by his daughter approximately 30 minutes after the fall. \nAssessment: Currently, the patient is exhibiting restlessness and agitation. Unequal pupil size noted: right pupil 5mm, sluggishly reactive; left pupil 3mm, reactive. BP 90/60, HR 52 bpm, RR 10 and irregular, SpO2 92% on room air. Clear fluid draining from the nose is observed. Skin is warm and dry. \nRecommendation: Recommend immediate neurological evaluation and possible CT scan of the head due to signs of increased intracranial pressure. Consider holding lisinopril due to hypotension."
