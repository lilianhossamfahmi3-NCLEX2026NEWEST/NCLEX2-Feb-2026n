Patient lives alone. Assessment: Currently stable on oral medications. Some mild lower extremity edema remains. Expresses concern about managing medications and diet at home. States she primarily speaks Spanish. Currently able to ambulate independently, but tires easily. Recent lab values indicate improved kidney function. Vital Signs: BP 130/80, HR 72, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. Radiology: Chest X-ray shows decreased pulmonary congestion. Recommendation: Ensure patient understands discharge instructions.

Patients' living situations, language proficiency, and access to resources significantly impact their ability to manage their health conditions effectively at home. Patients who live alone may need additional support to manage medications and access resources. Language barriers can hinder understanding of discharge instructions and medication regimens, necessitating translated materials and interpreter services. Limited access to affordable medications and healthy food can compromise adherence to prescribed treatments and dietary recommendations, leading to poorer health outcomes. Assessing home safety and accessibility ensures the patient can navigate their environment safely and perform activities of daily living, preventing falls and other adverse events. By addressing these SDOH, healthcare providers can promote health equity and improve the overall well-being of their patients.",
