Upon assessment, the nurse notes that the client is [lethargic] and responds slowly to verbal commands. The client's [skin is warm and dry with poor turgor]. The client's breath has a [distinct fruity odor], and respirations are [deep and rapid] at a rate of 32 breaths/min. The client reports [abdominal pain] rated as 6 on a scale of 0 to 10. A fingerstick glucose reading is [512 mg/dL]. Blood pressure is [92/58 mmHg], and the heart rate is [118 beats/min].",

        "correct": "All highlighted cues are classic indicators of DKA. Nausea/vomiting and inability to tolerate fluids lead to dehydration. Lethargy indicates metabolic acidosis affecting CNS. Warm/dry skin and poor turgor signify severe dehydration. Fruity breath (acetone) and Kussmaul respirations (deep/rapid) are compensatory mechanisms for metabolic acidosis. Abdominal pain is common in DKA. Hyperglycemia (>250), hypotension, and tachycardia are hallmark signs of fluid volume deficit and metabolic derangement in DKA.",
