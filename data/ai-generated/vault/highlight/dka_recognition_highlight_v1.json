  "passage": "The client is a 22-year-old with type 1 diabetes mellitus who presents with a 2-day history of illness. The client reports [nausea and being unable to keep fluids down]. Upon assessment, the nurse notes that the client is [lethargic] and responds slowly to verbal commands. The client's [skin is warm and dry with poor turgor]. The client's breath has a [distinct fruity odor], and respirations are [deep and rapid] at a rate of 32 breaths/min. The client reports [abdominal pain] rated as 6 on a scale of 0 to 10. A fingerstick glucose reading is [512 mg/dL]. Blood pressure is [92/58 mmHg], and the heart rate is [118 beats/min].",

    "correct": "All highlighted cues are classic indicators of DKA. Nausea and vomiting (0900 report) lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Lethargy (0905 finding) indicates central nervous system (CNS) depression due to metabolic acidosis and cerebral dehydration. Warm, dry skin with poor turgor (0910 assessment) signifies severe dehydration resulting from osmotic diuresis. Fruity breath (0915 observation) is due to acetone production from ketone metabolism, and Kussmaul respirations (deep and rapid, 32 breaths/min at 0920) are the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis by blowing off CO2. Abdominal pain (0925 complaint) is common in DKA due to gastric stasis and ileus. Hyperglycemia (512 mg/dL at 0930), hypotension (92/58 mmHg at 0935), and tachycardia (118 bpm at 0940) are hallmark signs of fluid volume deficit and the body's attempt to maintain cardiac output in the setting of dehydration and acidosis. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency, leading to unrestrained lipolysis and ketone body formation, resulting in metabolic acidosis and osmotic diuresis.",
    "incorrect": "Non-highlighted text provides context about the client's history and age, which are not specific diagnostic cues in themselves but support the clinical picture. These details are important for overall assessment but do not directly indicate DKA.",
    "clinicalPearls": "In DKA, the priority is fluid resuscitation (e.g., 0.9% normal saline) followed by insulin administration (e.g., regular insulin IV). Potassium levels must be monitored closely (every 1-2 hours initially) as insulin will shift potassium back into the cells, potentially causing hypokalemia. Cardiac monitoring is essential due to the risk of dysrhythmias from electrolyte imbalances.",
    "questionTrap": "Do not confuse DKA with Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome (HHS). DKA is more common in Type 1 diabetes, presents with lower glucose levels than HHS, and has significant ketosis and acidosis. HHS typically occurs in Type 2 diabetes and involves severe hyperglycemia without significant ketosis.",

        "heading": "DKA Assessment",
        "body": "Look for the triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. Physical signs include Kussmaul breathing and 'fruity' breath. Monitor vital signs closely, paying attention to blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Assess level of consciousness frequently."
