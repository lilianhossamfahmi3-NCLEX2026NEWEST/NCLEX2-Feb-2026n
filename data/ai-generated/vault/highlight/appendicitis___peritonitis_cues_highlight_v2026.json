Complaining of severe abdominal pain.\nBackground: Pain started yesterday, initially around umbilicus, now localized to RLQ. No bowel movement in 2 days. Nausea present.\nAssessment: Patient reports pain 8/10. Rebound tenderness and guarding noted in RLQ. Abdomen rigid. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 24, Temp 102.2°F. WBC 18,000.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about possible peritonitis. Requesting urgent surgical consult and further orders for fluid resuscitation and pain management. Will continue to monitor vital signs and pain level. Patient is NPO."
