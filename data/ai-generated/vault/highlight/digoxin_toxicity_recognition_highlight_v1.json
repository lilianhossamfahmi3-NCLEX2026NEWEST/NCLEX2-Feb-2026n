  "passage": "A client is being assessed in the cardiology clinic. The client reports [loss of appetite] and [persistent nausea] over the last few days. The client mentions [seeing yellow-green halos around lights] and having [blurred vision]. Upon assessment, the nurse finds the [apical heart rate is 48 beats/min] and [irregular]. The client reports [feeling extremely weak and tired]. Laboratory results show a [serum potassium of 3.2 mEq/L] and a [serum digoxin level of 2.8 ng/mL]. The nurse also notes the client has [had two episodes of diarrhea] this morning.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate digoxin toxicity. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, enhances myocardial contractility but has a narrow therapeutic index. This client's age (82) and renal insufficiency significantly increase the risk of toxicity due to decreased drug clearance. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can cause hypokalemia, further exacerbating digoxin's effects.\n\n*   **Loss of appetite, persistent nausea, and diarrhea:** These are early gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin affects the GI tract by increasing vagal tone and altering electrolyte balance, leading to these symptoms.\n*   **Seeing yellow-green halos around lights and blurred vision:** These are classic visual disturbances associated with digoxin toxicity. Digoxin affects the retinal cells and optic nerve, causing these characteristic visual changes.\n*   **Apical heart rate of 48 beats/min and irregular:** Digoxin toxicity can cause bradycardia and various arrhythmias. The drug's effect on the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes can lead to slowed conduction and irregular heart rhythms.\n*   **Feeling extremely weak and tired:** This is a common symptom of digoxin toxicity, resulting from the drug's impact on cellular function and electrolyte imbalances.\n*   **Serum potassium of 3.2 mEq/L:** Hypokalemia increases the binding of digoxin to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, enhancing its effects and increasing the risk of toxicity. Furosemide contributes to potassium loss.\n*   **Serum digoxin level of 2.8 ng/mL:** This level is above the therapeutic range (0.5-2.0 ng/mL), confirming digoxin toxicity.",
    "incorrect": "While age, heart failure, and renal insufficiency are risk factors for digoxin toxicity, they are not direct clinical manifestations of toxicity. They predispose the client to developing the condition.",
    "clinicalPearls": "**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess renal function (BUN, creatinine) and potassium levels before administering digoxin. Monitor for early signs of toxicity, especially in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Educate patients to report any GI or visual changes immediately. SBAR: Situation: 82-year-old with HF/renal insufficiency on digoxin/furosemide. Background: Reports anorexia, nausea, yellow-green halos, blurred vision, weakness, diarrhea. Assessment: Apical HR 48/irregular, K+ 3.2, digoxin 2.8. Recommendation: Hold digoxin, obtain ECG, administer potassium supplement, notify provider.",
    "questionTrap": "While fatigue and weakness are common symptoms, the GI and visual disturbances are more specific indicators of digoxin toxicity. Hypokalemia is a critical finding that significantly increases the risk.",
