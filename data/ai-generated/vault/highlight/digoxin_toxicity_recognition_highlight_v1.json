The client mentions [seeing yellow-green halos around lights] and having [blurred vision]. Upon assessment, the nurse finds the [apical heart rate is 48 beats/min] and [irregular]. The client reports [feeling extremely weak and tired]. Laboratory results show a [serum potassium of 3.2 mEq/L] and a [serum digoxin level of 2.8 ng/mL]. The nurse also notes the client has [had two episodes of diarrhea] this morning.",

        "correct": "Digoxin toxicity is common in the elderly and those with renal issues. Early signs are often GI: anorexia (loss of appetite), nausea, and diarrhea. Visual changes (halos, blurred vision) are classic. Bradycardia (<60) and arrhythmias are major cardiovascular cues. Fatigue and weakness are also common. Hypokalemia (3.2) is a critical finding because it significantly increases the risk of digoxin toxicity even if the digoxin level is near normal. A level of 2.8 ng/mL is definitely toxic (normal 0.5-2.0).",
