    "passage": "A 24-year-old male with a T4 spinal cord injury is being assessed in the rehabilitation unit. He reports a 'splitting headache' and feeling 'very flushed.' The nurse notes the client's blood pressure is 188/104 mmHg, whereas his baseline is usually 100/60. The client's face and neck are bright red and diaphoretic. His heart rate is 52 bpm. Upon inspection, the nurse notes profuse sweating above the level of the T4 injury but the skin is cool and pale below the injury level. The client's urinary catheter is noted to be kinked. The client's SpO2 is 98% on room air. The patient reports having a chronic history of muscle spasms in his legs.",
