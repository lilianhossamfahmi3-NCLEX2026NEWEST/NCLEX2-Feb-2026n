  "passage": "A 24-year-old male with a T4 spinal cord injury is being assessed in the rehabilitation unit. He reports a 'splitting headache' and feeling 'very flushed.' The nurse notes the client's blood pressure is 188/104 mmHg, whereas his baseline is usually 100/60. The client's face and neck are bright red and diaphoretic. His heart rate is 52 bpm. Upon inspection, the nurse notes profuse sweating above the level of the T4 injury but the skin is cool and pale below the injury level. The client's urinary catheter is noted to be kinked. The client's SpO2 is 98% on room air. The patient reports having a chronic history of muscle spasms in his legs.",

    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency in spinal cord injuries at or above T6, is triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of injury. This leads to an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response, causing severe hypertension (BP 188/104 mmHg, significantly elevated from baseline of 100/60). The body attempts to compensate via the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in bradycardia (HR 52 bpm). Vasodilation and diaphoresis occur *above* the level of injury due to parasympathetic stimulation, while vasoconstriction causes pallor and coolness *below* the injury. A kinked urinary catheter is a common noxious stimulus initiating this cascade. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent stroke, seizure, or death.",
    "incorrect": "Chronic muscle spasms are unrelated to the acute episode of autonomic dysreflexia. An SpO2 of 98% indicates adequate oxygenation and is not directly indicative of AD. While the headache is a symptom reported by the patient, the highlighted cues represent the objective physiological signs the nurse identifies during assessment.",

Catheterize if needed. Manually disimpact if needed. 4. **(0905)** Monitor blood pressure every 3-5 minutes. If BP remains elevated (e.g., systolic >150-160 mmHg), administer antihypertensive medication as prescribed (e.g., hydralazine, nifedipine). 5. **(0910)** Continue to monitor for resolution of symptoms and blood pressure stabilization. Document interventions and patient response."
