Treated with antibiotics. Developed a cough and fever last night. Labs drawn at 13:30 showed elevated D-dimer and decreased platelets.\nAssessment: BP is 90/60, HR 120, RR 24, O2 sat 92% on 2L NC. Noted petechiae on chest, active bleeding from IV site. Complains of severe abdominal pain and muscle cramping. Appears anxious and restless.\nRecommendation: STAT CBC, coagulation studies, and blood type/crossmatch. Consider fluid resuscitation and possible transfusion. Request immediate physician evaluation for DIC management."
