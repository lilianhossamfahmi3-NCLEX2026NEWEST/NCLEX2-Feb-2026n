When drinking water, the client [coughs and has difficulty swallowing]. The nurse observes that the client is [using accessory muscles to breathe] and has a [weak, nonproductive cough]. Physical assessment shows [proximal muscle weakness] that [worsens with repetitive movement]. The client's [vital capacity is 12 mL/kg]. The client also reports [double vision] which is [more pronounced in the evening].",

        "correct": "Myasthenia Gravis (MG) involves weakness of voluntary muscles. Ptosis (drooping eyes), mask-like face, and slurred/nasal speech indicate cranial nerve involvement. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and coughing indicate aspiration risk. Accessory muscle use and low vital capacity (normal is >15-20 mL/kg) signal impending myasthenic crisis and respiratory failure. Proximal weakness that worsens with use is the hallmark of MG. Diplopia (double vision) and fatigue that worsens throughout the day are classic symptoms.",
        "incorrect": "The trigger (respiratory infection) is not an assessment finding of MG itself.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The Tensilon test (edrophonium) can differentiate between myasthenic crisis (improves) and cholinergic crisis (worsens). Atropine should be available.",
        "questionTrap": "MG weakness improves with rest and worsens with activity. This is opposite to some other conditions like MS or inflammatory arthritis.",
