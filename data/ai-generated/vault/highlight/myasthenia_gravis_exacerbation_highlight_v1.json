When drinking water, the client [coughs and has difficulty swallowing]. The nurse observes that the client is [using accessory muscles to breathe] and has a [weak, nonproductive cough]. Physical assessment shows [proximal muscle weakness] that [worsens with repetitive movement]. The client's [vital capacity is 12 mL/kg]. The client also reports [double vision] which is [more pronounced in the evening].",

    "correct": "Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The pathophysiology involves antibodies that block, alter, or destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing muscle contraction. An upper respiratory infection can exacerbate MG symptoms.\n\n*   **Bilateral ptosis:** Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III), causes drooping eyelids.\n*   **Mask-like facial expression:** Weakness of facial muscles impairs expression.\n*   **Slurred and nasal speech:** Weakness of the muscles of the palate, pharynx, and tongue affects articulation and resonance.\n*   **Coughing and difficulty swallowing:** Weakness of the oropharyngeal muscles increases the risk of aspiration.\n*   **Accessory muscle use and weak, nonproductive cough:** Indicates respiratory muscle weakness and impending respiratory failure. Normal vital capacity is >15-20 mL/kg; 12 mL/kg indicates significant respiratory compromise.\n*   **Proximal muscle weakness that worsens with repetitive movement:** Hallmark of MG due to depletion of acetylcholine receptors.\n*   **Double vision (diplopia) more pronounced in the evening:** Weakness of extraocular muscles causes diplopia, which worsens with fatigue.",
    "incorrect": "The trigger (respiratory infection) is not an assessment finding of MG itself. While important to note, it doesn't directly reflect the neuromuscular compromise.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Administer medications (e.g., pyridostigmine) precisely on time to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent symptom exacerbation. Have suction equipment and oxygen readily available due to the risk of respiratory compromise. Teach the client energy conservation techniques to minimize fatigue. In myasthenic crisis, prioritize airway management and respiratory support.",
    "questionTrap": "Be careful not to confuse MG with other neurological disorders. The key differentiator is the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness and its exacerbation with activity.",
