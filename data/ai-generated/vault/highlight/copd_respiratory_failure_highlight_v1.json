  "passage": "A 72-year-old male with a 40-pack-year smoking history is admitted for a COPD exacerbation. He is currently receiving 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. The nurse notes that the patient is leaning forward with his hands on his knees. His respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute. The patient is using his sternocleidomastoid muscles to assist with breathing. When the nurse asks a question, the patient can only answer in one-word phrases. The patient's SpO2 is currently 86%. His heart rate is 112 bpm and blood pressure is 158/92 mmHg. The patient appears increasingly drowsy and difficult to arouse.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate acute respiratory failure. Leaning forward (tripod position) maximizes lung expansion. Tachypnea (RR 32) reflects the body's attempt to compensate for hypoxia and hypercapnia. Accessory muscle use (sternocleidomastoid) indicates increased work of breathing. One-word dyspnea signifies severe breathlessness. An SpO2 of 86% despite supplemental oxygen suggests refractory hypoxemia. Drowsiness and difficulty arousing indicate hypercapnia and CO2 narcosis, impairing neurological function. In COPD, chronic inflammation and structural changes in the lungs (e.g., emphysema) lead to airflow obstruction and impaired gas exchange. During an exacerbation, these issues worsen, leading to increased CO2 retention and decreased oxygen levels. The body's compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed, resulting in respiratory failure.",
    "incorrect": "Smoking history is relevant but doesn't directly indicate acute failure. 2L oxygen via nasal cannula is the current intervention, not a sign of failure itself. Hypertension (158/92) and tachycardia (112) are signs of stress but are less specific to respiratory failure than respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and mental status changes. While these vital sign changes can be related to hypoxemia and hypercapnia, they are not as direct indicators of respiratory failure as the highlighted findings.",
