The nurse notes that the patient is leaning forward with his hands on his knees. His respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute. The patient is using his sternocleidomastoid muscles to assist with breathing. When the nurse asks a question, the patient can only answer in one-word phrases. The patient's SpO2 is currently 86%. His heart rate is 112 bpm and blood pressure is 158/92 mmHg. The patient appears increasingly drowsy and difficult to arouse.",
