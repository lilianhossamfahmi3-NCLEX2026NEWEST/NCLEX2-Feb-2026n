Reports seeing halos around lights. Exam revealed a fixed, dilated left pupil and significant conjunctival redness. BP is 90/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 95%. Patient is anxious and diaphoretic. Administered prescribed antiemetic for nausea. Contacted ophthalmology resident on call. Will continue to monitor vital signs and patient's condition.

    "correct": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. Sudden onset of severe eye pain is a hallmark symptom. A fixed and dilated pupil indicates increased intraocular pressure and damage to the optic nerve. Hypotension (BP 90/60) in this setting is concerning and needs immediate attention, as it can further compromise optic nerve perfusion. Tachycardia and tachypnea are expected findings due to pain and anxiety but are not as critical as the other findings.",

Conjunctival redness is also expected but less critical than the other findings. While tachycardia (HR 110 bpm) and tachypnea (RR 24) are signs of distress, they are not the most immediate concerns in this situation. SpO2 of 95% is acceptable and not a priority.",
