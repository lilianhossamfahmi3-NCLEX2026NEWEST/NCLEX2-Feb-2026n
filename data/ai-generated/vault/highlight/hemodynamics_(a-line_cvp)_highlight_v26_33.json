    "correct": "A sudden decrease in blood pressure with a dampened arterial waveform (90/50 mmHg, MAP 63 mmHg) indicates potential hypoperfusion and requires immediate assessment and intervention. Elevated CVP (11 mmHg) suggests fluid overload or right ventricular dysfunction, necessitating further evaluation and potential treatment. An increasing heart rate (98 bpm) may indicate compensation for decreased cardiac output or other underlying issues requiring investigation.",
    "incorrect": "A urine output of 40 mL/hr is within the acceptable range for an adult patient and does not indicate an immediate problem. Clear lung sounds bilaterally suggest adequate ventilation and absence of pulmonary congestion, thus not requiring immediate intervention. Normal lab values (Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN, Creatinine, Hgb, Hct, WBC) do not require immediate intervention.",
