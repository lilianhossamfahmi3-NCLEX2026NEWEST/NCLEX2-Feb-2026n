    "correct": "A sudden decrease in blood pressure with a dampened arterial waveform indicates a potential occlusion or displacement of the arterial line, requiring immediate assessment and intervention to ensure accurate monitoring and prevent complications. Elevated CVP suggests fluid overload or right ventricular dysfunction, necessitating assessment and potential adjustments to fluid administration. An increasing heart rate may indicate hypovolemia or other underlying issues requiring further investigation.",
    "incorrect": "A CVP within the normal range (2-8 mmHg) does not require immediate intervention. Similarly, a urine output of 40 mL/hr is within the acceptable range and doesn't indicate an immediate problem. Clear lung sounds bilaterally suggest adequate ventilation and absence of pulmonary congestion, thus not requiring immediate intervention.",
