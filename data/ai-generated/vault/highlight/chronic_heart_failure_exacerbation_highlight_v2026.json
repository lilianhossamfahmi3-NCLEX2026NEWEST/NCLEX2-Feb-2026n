Vital signs show [BP 90/60 mmHg], [HR 110 bpm], [RR 28 breaths/min], and [SpO2 88% on room air]. The client appears [anxious and restless].",

Patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, admitted yesterday for exacerbation. \n07:15 Patient states, 'I can't catch my breath.' Increased work of breathing observed. \n07:30 Notified provider of patient's condition. Orders received and implemented: Oxygen 2L via nasal cannula, furosemide 40mg IV push, and repeat vital signs in 15 minutes. \n07:45 Patient reports slight improvement in breathing after oxygen administration. Will continue to monitor closely and assess response to furosemide. Notified respiratory therapy for evaluation. \n08:00 Patient remains anxious. Encouraged patient to use pursed-lip breathing. \n08:15 Provider at bedside assessing patient. Awaiting further orders."
