Upon assessment, the nurse notes [visible peristaltic waves], [frequent emesis after feeding], [olive-shaped mass palpated in the RUQ], [sunken fontanelles], [weight loss of 10% since birth], and [decreased skin turgor]. The infant's vital signs show [heart rate of 180 bpm], [respiratory rate of 55 breaths/min], and [blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg]. The parents report the infant is [lethargic and difficult to arouse] after vomiting.",

Parents report symptoms started approximately 1 week ago, progressively worsening. Infant initially content between feedings, now increasingly irritable. 07:15 Noted emesis immediately post-feeding, non-bilious, forceful. 07:30 Abdomen assessed; visible peristaltic waves observed. Possible olive-shaped mass palpated in the RUQ. 07:45 Noted sunken fontanelles and decreased skin turgor. Appears dehydrated. Weight loss of 10% since birth documented. 08:00 Notified Dr. Smith of assessment findings. Awaiting orders."

Visible peristaltic waves and an olive-shaped mass are classic signs of pyloric stenosis. Sunken fontanelles, decreased skin turgor, and weight loss confirm dehydration. The elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, along with low blood pressure, suggest hypovolemic shock. Lethargy indicates a compromised neurological status. These findings necessitate immediate intervention to prevent further complications.",
