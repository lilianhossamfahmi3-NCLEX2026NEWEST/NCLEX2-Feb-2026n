He was admitted at 10:00 today with chest pain that started around 09:00 this morning. He rates the pain 8/10, describing it as crushing and radiating to his left arm. He is diaphoretic and appears anxious.\n\nHis current medications include aspirin 325 mg PO STAT, metoprolol 5 mg IV push STAT, and morphine 4 mg IV push STAT. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicative of an inferior wall MI.\n\nMr. Smith's current vital signs are BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, and temp 98.9°F (37.2°C). I am concerned about his persistent chest pain, hypotension, and elevated troponin levels. I am requesting an immediate cardiology consult for consideration of emergent PCI and further orders to address his pain and hemodynamic instability.",
