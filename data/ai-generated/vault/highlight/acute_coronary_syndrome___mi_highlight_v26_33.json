      "SBAR": "14:00, I am Nurse Jones calling from the cardiac unit regarding Mr. David Smith, DOB 03/08/1968. He was admitted at 10:00 today with chest pain. His pain started around 09:00 this morning. He rates it 8/10, crushing, and radiating to his left arm. He is diaphoretic and anxious.\n\nHis current medications include aspirin 325 mg PO, metoprolol 5mg IV push, and morphine 4mg IV push. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.\n\nMr. Smith's current vital signs are BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, and temp 98.9°F (37.2°C). I am concerned about his persistent chest pain and hypotension. He needs further evaluation and potential intervention for an acute myocardial infarction. I am requesting immediate cardiology consult and further orders for his hypotension and pain.",

    "clinicalPearls": "In acute myocardial infarction, the primary goals are to relieve pain, improve oxygenation, and restore coronary blood flow. Hypotension, persistent chest pain despite analgesics, tachycardia, and elevated cardiac biomarkers are all critical findings requiring immediate attention. Remember the acronym 'MONA' (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin) for initial management, but prioritize assessment and address life-threatening issues first.",
    "questionTrap": "Many students may fixate on the SpO2 of 92%, thinking it's the most critical issue. While it's important, it's relatively stable with oxygen supplementation. The combination of chest pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated troponin levels indicates a more urgent and unstable situation that requires immediate intervention to prevent further cardiac damage.",
