His current vital signs show [BP 90/60 mmHg], [HR 120 bpm], [RR 32 breaths/min], [SpO2 96% on room air], and [temperature 36.2°C (97.2°F)]. Lab results reveal [serum glucose of 650 mg/dL] and [potassium of 3.0 mEq/L]. The patient is [lethargic] and [oriented only to name].",

Deep, rapid respirations (Kussmaul's respirations) and fruity-smelling breath are indicative of metabolic acidosis and ketone production. Hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 120 bpm), and tachypnea (RR 32 breaths/min) are signs of hypovolemic shock due to osmotic diuresis. A serum glucose of 650 mg/dL confirms severe hyperglycemia. Potassium of 3.0 mEq/L signifies hypokalemia, a dangerous electrolyte imbalance. Lethargy and orientation only to name suggest worsening neurological status. These findings collectively point to a severe metabolic crisis requiring rapid fluid resuscitation, insulin administration, and electrolyte correction.",
