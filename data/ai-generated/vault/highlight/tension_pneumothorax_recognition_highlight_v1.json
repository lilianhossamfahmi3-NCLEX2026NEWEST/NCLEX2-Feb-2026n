Auscultation reveals [absent breath sounds on the right] side. The nurse observes [distended neck veins] and [narrowing pulse pressure]. Physical assessment shows [hyperresonance on percussion] of the right chest. Vital signs reveal a [blood pressure of 82/50 mmHg] and a [heart rate of 144 beats/min]. The client's [skin is cool, clammy, and cyanotic]. The nurse notes that the [chest tube has stopped bubbling] and appears to be kinked.",

        "correct": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency where air enters the pleural space but cannot escape. Cues include severe respiratory distress, tracheal deviation (away from the affected side), absent breath sounds on the affected side, and obstructive shock (hypotension, tachycardia). JVD (distended neck veins) occurs because the high intrathoracic pressure prevents venous return to the heart. Hyperresonance on percussion is characteristic of air in the pleural space. A kinked chest tube is a likely cause of the sudden tension buildup.",
        "incorrect": "The history of the accident is context.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Immediate treatment for tension pneumothorax is needle decompression (at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line) followed by a new or functioning chest tube.",
        "questionTrap": "Tracheal deviation is a LATE sign. The most important early indicators are the respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability.",
