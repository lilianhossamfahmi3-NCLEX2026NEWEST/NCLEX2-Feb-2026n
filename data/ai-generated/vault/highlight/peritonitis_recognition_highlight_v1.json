Upon inspection, the [abdomen is distended] and [appears to be 'board-like' and rigid] to palpation. The client exhibits [rebound tenderness] across all quadrants. Vital signs reveal a [temperature of 102.2°F], a [heart rate of 124 beats/min], and a [blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg]. The nurse observes the client is [shallowly breathing] and [reluctant to cough or move]. Auscultation reveals [absent bowel sounds] in all four quadrants. The client reports [nausea and has had one episode of vomiting].",

        "correct": "Peritonitis is an acute inflammation and infection of the peritoneal lining, often resulting from perforation of a hollow organ (e.g., peptic ulcer, appendicitis). The inflammatory process leads to fluid shifts, bacterial contamination, and potential sepsis. The 'board-like' rigid abdomen results from involuntary muscle guarding, a protective mechanism to minimize pain. Lying still with knees flexed reduces abdominal wall tension. Rebound tenderness indicates peritoneal inflammation. Fever (39°C), tachycardia (124 bpm), and hypotension (96/54 mmHg) suggest systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and potential septic shock due to bacterial translocation. Shallow breathing minimizes abdominal movement and associated pain. Absent bowel sounds (paralytic ileus) occur due to inflammation inhibiting peristalsis. Nausea and vomiting are common due to bowel obstruction and irritation of the peritoneum. Abdominal distension results from fluid and gas accumulation in the peritoneal cavity.",
        "incorrect": "The client's age and history of peptic ulcer disease are risk factors for peritonitis but are not direct clinical findings indicating acute peritonitis. These factors increase the index of suspicion but require corroborating physical exam and vital sign abnormalities.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Peritonitis is a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention. Sepsis can develop rapidly. Implement the following: NPO status, IV fluid resuscitation (crystalloids), broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, pain management, and continuous monitoring of vital signs and urine output. Prepare the client for surgical intervention (e.g., exploratory laparotomy) to identify and repair the source of the contamination. SBAR communication is critical.",
        "questionTrap": "Clients with peritonitis typically lie STILL to minimize pain. Clients with renal or biliary colic (stones) often exhibit restlessness and an inability to find a comfortable position due to the intense, spasmodic pain.",
