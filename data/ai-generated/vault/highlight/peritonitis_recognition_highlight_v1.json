Upon inspection, the [abdomen is distended] and [appears to be 'board-like' and rigid] to palpation. The client exhibits [rebound tenderness] across all quadrants. Vital signs reveal a [temperature of 102.2°F], a [heart rate of 124 beats/min], and a [blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg]. The nurse observes the client is [shallowly breathing] and [reluctant to cough or move]. Auscultation reveals [absent bowel sounds] in all four quadrants. The client reports [nausea and has had one episode of vomiting].",

        "correct": "Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, often due to organ perforation. Classic signs include a 'board-like' rigid abdomen (from involuntary muscle guarding), lying still (movement exacerbates pain), and rebound tenderness. Systemic signs include fever, tachycardia, and hypotension (indicating potential septic shock). Absent bowel sounds (paralytic ileus) and shallow breathing (to avoid abdominal movement) are common. Nausea/vomiting and abdominal distension are also key cues.",
