Between these episodes, the infant [appears lethargic and listless]. The parent notes that the infant has had [two episodes of vomiting] that appear bile-stained. Upon palpation, the nurse finds a [sausage-shaped mass in the upper right quadrant]. The infant's most recent stool was [dark red and jelly-like] in consistency. The child's [abdomen is tender and slightly distended]. Vital signs show a [heart rate of 162 beats/min]. The infant's [skin is pale and cool].",

        "correct": "Intussusception is the telescoping of one part of the intestine into another. Classic cues include sudden, episodic abdominal pain (evidenced by knees-to-chest crying), 'currant jelly' stools (blood/mucus), and a sausage-shaped abdominal mass. Bilious vomiting, lethargy between episodes, abdominal tenderness, and signs of shock (tachycardia, pale/cool skin) are also characteristic of the condition and potential bowel ischemia or perforation.",
        "incorrect": "The fact that the infant's heart rate is 162 is a finding (item 9 in span but indexed as 9 if we count properly). Wait, I missed indexing one. Let's re-verify indices.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The diagnostic and often therapeutic intervention for intussusception is an air or saline enema. If the child passes a normal brown stool, it may indicate spontaneous reduction of the intussusception and should be reported immediately.",
        "questionTrap": "The 'sausage-shaped' mass is for intussusception. The 'olive-shaped' mass is for pyloric stenosis.",
