    "correct": "Elevated potassium levels can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Changes in the ECG, such as peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes, are indicative of hyperkalemia's effect on cardiac conduction. Muscle weakness is another significant sign of hyperkalemia due to altered cell membrane excitability.",
    "incorrect": "Normal saline infusion is a standard treatment and does not require highlighting. While the creatinine level is elevated, it is not an acute finding requiring immediate intervention in this context. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is elevated but not critically high in this patient's acute presentation of hyperkalemia.",
