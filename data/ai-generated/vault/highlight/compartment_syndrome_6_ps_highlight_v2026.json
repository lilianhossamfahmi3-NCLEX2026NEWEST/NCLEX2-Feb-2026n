Pain reported as 7/10 despite morphine 4mg IV given at 1330. 1415: Neurovascular assessment performed. Leg appears pale. Pedal pulse weaker compared to unaffected side. Reports increased pain with movement. 1430: Pain now 9/10. Another dose of morphine requested. 1445: Pain unrelieved by morphine. Noted increasing tenseness in calf. 1500: Notified Dr. Smith of findings. Orders received for stat compartment pressure measurement."
