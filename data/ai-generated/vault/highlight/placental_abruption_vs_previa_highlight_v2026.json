Patient reports sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. 1405: Noted a rigid, board-like abdomen upon palpation. Continuous fetal monitoring initiated. Fetal heart rate showing late decelerations. 1410: Maternal vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120 bpm, O2 sat 92% on room air. Patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. 1415: Notified Dr. Smith of the patient's condition and awaiting further orders. Preparing for potential emergency C-section. 1420: Continued monitoring of maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate. Patient continues to report severe pain. Oxygen increased to 6L via nasal cannula."
