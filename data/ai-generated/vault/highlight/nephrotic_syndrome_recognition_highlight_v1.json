    "passage": "A 4-year-old child is brought to the clinic because his 'pants are too tight' and his 'eyes look puffy' in the morning. On assessment, the nurse notes severe periorbital edema and generalized edema (anasarca). The child's weight has increased by 15% since his check-up two months ago. A urine dipstick shows 4+ protein but no blood. Laboratory results reveal a serum albumin level of 1.8 g/dL (normal 3.5-5.0). The child's blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, which is normal for his age. Serum cholesterol is elevated at 280 mg/dL. The child's temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C).",
