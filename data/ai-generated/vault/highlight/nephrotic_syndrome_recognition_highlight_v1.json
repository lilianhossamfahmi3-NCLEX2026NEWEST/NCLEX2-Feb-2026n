  "passage": "A 4-year-old child is brought to the clinic because his 'pants are too tight' and his 'eyes look puffy' in the morning. On assessment, the nurse notes severe periorbital edema and generalized edema (anasarca). The child's weight has increased by 15% since his check-up two months ago. A urine dipstick shows 4+ protein but no blood. Laboratory results reveal a serum albumin level of 1.8 g/dL (normal 3.5-5.0). The child's blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, which is normal for his age. Serum cholesterol is elevated at 280 mg/dL. The child's temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C).",

    "correct": "Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is characterized by the classic triad of massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The pathophysiology involves damage to the glomerular basement membrane, specifically the podocytes. This damage increases permeability, leading to significant protein loss in the urine (proteinuria). The liver attempts to compensate by increasing albumin production, but it cannot keep up with the loss, resulting in hypoalbuminemia. The decreased oncotic pressure from low albumin causes fluid to shift from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, leading to edema. Hyperlipidemia occurs because the liver also increases lipoprotein production in response to the low albumin levels. Rapid weight gain (15% in two months) is a direct result of fluid retention.",
    "incorrect": "Normal blood pressure (98/62 mmHg) is a distractor; hypertension is more commonly associated with nephritic syndrome (e.g., glomerulonephritis) due to sodium and water retention. A normal temperature (37.0°C) is a non-contributory finding as MCNS is not typically associated with fever unless there is a secondary infection.",

Common causes include minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy.\n\nNephritic Syndrome: Characterized by hematuria, hypertension, oliguria, and azotemia (elevated BUN and creatinine). Proteinuria is present but less severe than in nephrotic syndrome. Common causes include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Periorbital edema is often the first sign noticed by parents, frequently mistaken for allergies initially. Monitor for signs of infection, as patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk due to loss of immunoglobulins in the urine. Administering albumin infusions can temporarily increase oncotic pressure, but it is not a long-term solution. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for minimal change disease."
