The patient is in acute respiratory distress.\n\nBackground: Parent reports sudden onset of symptoms this morning, including fever and difficulty swallowing. No known allergies. Immunizations are up to date.\n\nAssessment: Child is sitting upright, leaning forward, drooling, and exhibiting inspiratory stridor. Respiratory rate is 36 and labored, SpO2 90% on room air. Blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, heart rate 140 bpm. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds.\n\nRecommendation: Immediate ENT consult is needed. Prepare for possible intubation and transfer to ICU. Keep NPO and minimize stimulation. Continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring required. Administer humidified oxygen. Ensure emergency airway equipment is readily available. Notify MD immediately.\n\n07:15 MD notified. Orders received and implemented.\n07:30 Preparing for stat portable CXR and ENT consult.\n07:45 ENT at bedside assessing patient. Prepare intubation tray and emergency airway equipment."
