Background: Parent reports sudden onset of symptoms this morning. Assessment: Child is sitting upright, drooling, and exhibiting inspiratory stridor. RR is 36 and labored, SpO2 90% on room air. Blood pressure is 90/60, heart rate 140. Recommendation: Immediate ENT consult, prepare for possible intubation and transfer to ICU. Keep NPO and minimize stimulation. Continuous monitoring required. 07:15 MD notified. Orders received and implemented. 07:30 Preparing for stat portable CXR and ENT consult. 07:45 ENT at bedside assessing patient. Prepare intubation tray and emergency airway equipment."
