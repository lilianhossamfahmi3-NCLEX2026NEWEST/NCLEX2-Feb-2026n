Pain out of proportion to the injury, especially with passive motion, is a cardinal sign of compartment syndrome. Paresthesia is an early neurological sign of nerve compression within the compartment. Tense swelling indicates increased pressure within the compartment. Diminished or absent pulses, while a later sign, confirm vascular compromise. A capillary refill of 2 seconds is normal and does not suggest compartment syndrome. A temperature of 37.2°C (99°F) is within normal limits post-operatively.",

He states the pain is much worse than his surgical pain.\n\n**B:** Patient underwent an uneventful TKA on Monday. His PMH includes hypertension and osteoarthritis. He is currently on hydromorphone for pain, cefazolin for prophylaxis, and aspirin for DVT prophylaxis. Ambulation started yesterday with PT.\n\n**A:** Pain is out of proportion to the expected post-op pain. Neurovascular assessment reveals paresthesia in the left foot and tense swelling in the calf. Pedal pulses are diminished bilaterally but weaker on the left. Creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels are elevated (see Labs). Urine output has decreased over the last 4 hours, and urine is dark and concentrated. VS stable.\n\n**R:** Notify the surgeon immediately for possible compartment syndrome.
