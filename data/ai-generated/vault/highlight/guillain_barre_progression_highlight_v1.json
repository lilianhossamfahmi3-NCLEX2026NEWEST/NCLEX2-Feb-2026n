The client reports [deep muscle aching in the thighs]. As the assessment continues, the nurse notes that the client has [difficulty clearing secretions] and [shallow respirations]. Vital signs show [labile blood pressure] and [tachycardia]. The client reports [loss of bladder control] starting this morning.",

        "correct": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). The pathophysiology involves an autoimmune response, often triggered by a preceding infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, or Zika virus). This immune response leads to the destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves, impairing nerve conduction. The hallmark clinical presentation is ascending paralysis, typically starting in the feet and progressing upwards. Paresthesia (numbness and tingling) often precedes the motor weakness. Areflexia (absent deep tendon reflexes) is a crucial diagnostic feature, reflecting the nerve damage. Deep muscle pain is common due to nerve inflammation. Respiratory involvement, manifested as shallow breathing and difficulty clearing secretions, is a critical complication due to paralysis of respiratory muscles. Autonomic dysfunction, including labile blood pressure and tachycardia, arises from damage to the autonomic nervous system fibers. Bowel and bladder dysfunction can occur due to nerve involvement affecting sphincter control.",
        "incorrect": "While a viral illness often precedes GBS, it is the subsequent autoimmune response and neurological manifestations that are characteristic of the syndrome itself. The highlighted findings directly reflect the neurological damage caused by GBS.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Clinical Pearl: Monitor respiratory function closely (vital capacity, ABGs) in GBS patients. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required. Clinical Pearl: IVIG or plasmapheresis are the mainstays of treatment, aiming to reduce the severity and duration of the autoimmune attack.",
        "questionTrap": "GBS typically presents with symmetrical weakness. Asymmetrical weakness should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses.",

Absent deep tendon reflexes noted.\nAssessment: Client exhibits ascending weakness, areflexia, unsteady gait, deep muscle aching, difficulty clearing secretions, shallow respirations, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, and loss of bladder control. Respiratory status requires close monitoring.\nRecommendation: Initiate continuous respiratory monitoring (SpO2, ABGs, vital capacity). Consult neurology for IVIG or plasmapheresis consideration. Monitor for autonomic dysfunction and manage accordingly. Prepare for potential intubation if respiratory compromise worsens. Strict I/O monitoring due to bladder dysfunction. Provide supportive care and pain management. Notify provider of any significant changes in neurological or respiratory status."
