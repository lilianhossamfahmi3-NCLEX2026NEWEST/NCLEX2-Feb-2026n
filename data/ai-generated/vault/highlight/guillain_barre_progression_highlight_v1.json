Upon assessment, the nurse notes [absent deep tendon reflexes] in the lower extremities. The client demonstrates [unsteady gait and poor balance]. The client reports [deep muscle aching in the thighs]. As the assessment continues, the nurse notes that the client has [difficulty clearing secretions] and [shallow respirations]. Vital signs show [labile blood pressure] and [tachycardia]. The client reports [loss of bladder control] starting this morning.",

        "correct": "GBS is an acute, inflammatory polyneuropathy. The hallmark is ascending paralysis (feet → legs → hips). Paresthesia (tingling) often precedes weakness. Areflexia (absent DTRs) is a required diagnostic feature. Deep muscle pain is common. Respiratory involvement (shallow breathing, difficulty with secretions) is the most critical complication. Autonomic dysfunction (labile BP, tachycardia) and bowel/bladder issues are also characteristic as the syndrome progresses.",
        "incorrect": "The viral illness is a trigger but not a characteristic finding of the syndrome itself.",
