        "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: Maria Rodriguez, a 68-year-old female, was admitted three days ago for community-acquired pneumonia. She has responded well to IV antibiotics and oxygen therapy and is being prepared for discharge.\nBackground: Ms. Rodriguez has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both managed with oral medications. She lives alone in a low-income housing complex and relies on public transportation. She reports occasional food insecurity.\nAssessment: Ms. Rodriguez is currently stable with clear lung sounds and normal vital signs. She demonstrates understanding of her medication regimen and the importance of follow-up appointments. However, she expresses concern about affording her medications and accessing transportation for her appointments. She also admits to sometimes skipping meals to save money.\nRecommendation: Ensure Ms. Rodriguez has resources for medication assistance and transportation. A referral to a social worker has been placed to assist with these needs. Schedule a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician within one week. Provide written discharge instructions in Spanish, her preferred language.",

            "rationale": "Living alone in a low-income housing complex presents several SDOH risks. Social isolation can decrease motivation for self-care and adherence to medical advice. Low-income housing often correlates with limited access to resources and support systems, making it difficult for patients to manage their health effectively post-discharge. This can lead to poorer health outcomes and increased readmission rates. Consider the patient's access to transportation, healthy food options, and social support within their living environment. ClinicalPearl: Assess the availability of community resources and support networks in the patient's residential area.",

QuestionTrap: Some may overlook this if they assume reliable transportation is always available. However, access to transportation is a critical SDOH factor.
