The nurse's assessment reveals [a heart rate of 120 bpm], [a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C)], and [a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute]. His blood pressure is [88/52 mmHg]. The patient appears [confused and lethargic]. The nurse also notes [decreased urine output] over the past 4 hours. His skin is [cool and clammy]. Laboratory results show [an elevated white blood cell count of 18,000/μL] and [an elevated lactate level of 4.0 mmol/L].",

WBC 18, Lactate 4.0. A: Possible sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Deteriorating condition. R: Recommend STAT blood cultures, start broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid bolus. Consider vasopressors if BP doesn't improve with fluids. Monitor urine output closely. Notify provider of any further changes. 07:15 Notified Dr. Smith of above findings.
