        "correct": "Pancreatic insufficiency in CF leads to fat and protein malabsorption. Steatorrhea (oily, foul-smelling stools) is the hallmark. Stools that float and are hard to flush indicate high fat content. Failure to thrive (low weight percentile) and muscle wasting despite high appetite are key signs. Protuberant abdomen (from gas/bulk) and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (causing dry skin and bruising/Vitamin K) are classic GI/nutritional cues. Digital clubbing is common in CF but primarily reflects chronic hypoxia from lung involvement.",

        "questionTrap": "Digital clubbing is a sign of chronic hypoxia, but the question specifically asked for findings of 'fat malabsorption'. However, in CF, these often go together as part of the overall disease picture.",
