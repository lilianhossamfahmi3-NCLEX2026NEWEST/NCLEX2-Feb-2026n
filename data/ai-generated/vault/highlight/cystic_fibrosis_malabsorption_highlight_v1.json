    "correct": "Pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis (CF) results from thick mucus obstructing the pancreatic ducts, preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the small intestine. This leads to malabsorption of fats, proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins. Steatorrhea (frequent, large, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush and contain oil droplets) is a hallmark sign of fat malabsorption. The unabsorbed fat also contributes to abdominal cramping and excessive flatulence. Failure to thrive (weight in the 5th percentile despite a high appetite) and thin, wasted extremities indicate inadequate nutrient absorption. A protuberant abdomen can result from increased gas production and unabsorbed bulk in the intestines. Deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) manifest as dry, flaky skin (vitamin A deficiency) and easy bruising (vitamin K deficiency). Digital clubbing is primarily associated with chronic hypoxia due to lung disease in CF, but can also be related to malabsorption.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting only some of the findings related to fat malabsorption will not provide a complete picture of the child's condition. Each of the highlighted findings contributes to the overall assessment of fat malabsorption and inadequate pancreatic enzyme replacement. Failing to recognize all the signs can lead to underestimation of the severity of the malabsorption and inadequate treatment.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is crucial for managing malabsorption in CF. Enzymes should be administered with all meals and snacks containing fat. The dosage is individualized based on stool consistency and frequency, aiming for 1-2 formed stools per day. Monitor for signs of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and supplement as needed.",
    "questionTrap": "Digital clubbing, while present in CF, is primarily indicative of chronic hypoxia related to lung disease. The question specifically asks for findings related to fat malabsorption. However, it's important to recognize that both pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations are common in CF and can occur concurrently.",

    "background": "The child has a history of CF and is currently on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The parent reports concerns about the child's stool characteristics and growth.",
    "assessment": "The child presents with frequent, large, greasy, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea), stools difficult to flush, oil droplets in stools, weight in the 5th percentile, digital clubbing, thin, wasted extremities, protuberant abdomen, dry, flaky skin, easy bruising, cramping abdominal pain, excessive flatulence, and low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).",
    "recommendation": "I recommend evaluating the child's pancreatic enzyme dosage and adherence. Consult with a registered dietitian for nutritional support and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Consider further diagnostic testing to assess the degree of malabsorption and rule out other potential complications. Monitor stool frequency and consistency, growth parameters, and vitamin levels. Educate the family on proper enzyme administration and dietary management."
