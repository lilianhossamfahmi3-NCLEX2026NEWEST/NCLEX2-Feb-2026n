The client's skin is dry and she has fine, downy hair (lanugo) on her back and arms. Her heart rate is 42 bpm, and her blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg. The client reports she has not had a menstrual period in 4 months. Physical exam reveals a 'chipmunk-like' facial appearance due to parotid gland enlargement. The client reports she has always been a 'straight-A student' and participates in competitive gymnastics. The client's temperature is 96.8°F (36.0°C).",
