  "passage": "A 16-year-old female is brought to the clinic by her mother for 'lack of energy.' The nurse notes the patient's BMI is 16.2 kg/m². The client's skin is dry and she has fine, downy hair (lanugo) on her back and arms. Her heart rate is 42 bpm, and her blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg. The client reports she has not had a menstrual period in 4 months. Physical exam reveals a 'chipmunk-like' facial appearance due to parotid gland enlargement. The client reports she has always been a 'straight-A student' and participates in competitive gymnastics. The client's temperature is 96.8°F (36.0°C).",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings are consistent with the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. A BMI of 16.2 kg/m² indicates severe underweight, reflecting chronic energy deficit. Lanugo, fine downy hair, develops as the body attempts to conserve heat due to decreased subcutaneous fat. Bradycardia (HR 42 bpm) and hypotension (88/52 mmHg) are compensatory mechanisms to reduce cardiac workload in response to decreased metabolic demands and electrolyte imbalances. Amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation, results from hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction due to malnutrition and hormonal imbalances. Hypothermia (96.8°F/36.0°C) is another manifestation of the body's attempt to conserve energy. Parotid gland enlargement can occur due to repeated vomiting in the binge-purge subtype, causing salivary gland inflammation.",
    "incorrect": "While being a 'straight-A student' and participating in competitive gymnastics are common characteristics of individuals with anorexia nervosa, reflecting perfectionistic tendencies and a drive for thinness, they are psychosocial factors and not direct physical assessment findings related to the physiological effects of starvation. These behaviors can contribute to the development and maintenance of the disorder but are not objective signs of the physical condition.",

        "body": "Anorexia nervosa can lead to severe physical complications due to chronic malnutrition and physiological stress. Cardiovascular complications include mitral valve prolapse, arrhythmias (e.g., prolonged QT interval), and cardiomyopathy. Endocrine disturbances include hypoglycemia, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis due to decreased estrogen production. Integumentary changes include brittle nails, dry skin, and carotenemia (yellowing of the skin due to impaired conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A). Bone health is compromised, leading to osteopenia and osteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures."

      "Bradycardia and hypothermia in anorexia nervosa are adaptive mechanisms to conserve energy in the starvation state. Monitor electrolyte levels closely, especially potassium, as refeeding syndrome can lead to life-threatening electrolyte imbalances.",
      "Patients with anorexia nervosa often have distorted body image and may deny the severity of their condition. A collaborative approach involving medical, psychological, and nutritional interventions is essential for effective treatment."

    "situation": "10/26/2026 14:00: A 16-year-old female is being evaluated for suspected anorexia nervosa due to reported lack of energy and significant weight loss.",
    "background": "The patient presents with a BMI of 16.2 kg/m², dry skin, lanugo on her back and arms, bradycardia (42 bpm), hypotension (88/52 mmHg), amenorrhea for the past 4 months, and hypothermia (36.0°C). She reports being a 'straight-A student' and participates in competitive gymnastics.",
    "assessment": "The patient exhibits several physical assessment findings consistent with anorexia nervosa, including significantly low BMI, signs of malnutrition (dry skin, lanugo), cardiovascular instability (bradycardia, hypotension), and endocrine dysfunction (amenorrhea, hypothermia). These findings indicate significant physiological compromise.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate a comprehensive evaluation, including laboratory studies (electrolytes, complete blood count, liver function tests, EKG), nutritional assessment, and psychological evaluation. Implement a refeeding protocol under close medical supervision to prevent refeeding syndrome. Consult with a multidisciplinary team including a physician, registered dietitian, and mental health professional. Monitor vital signs, electrolyte levels, and cardiac function closely. Provide psychological support and education to the patient and her family."
