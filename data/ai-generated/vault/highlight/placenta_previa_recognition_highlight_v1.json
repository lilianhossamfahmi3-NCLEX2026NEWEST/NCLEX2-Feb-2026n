Client denies abdominal pain or trauma. No known allergies. Fetal movement reported as normal.\nA: Assessment reveals [no abdominal pain or cramping]. Uterus is [uterus is soft and nontender]. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows [baseline of 140/min with moderate variability] and [presence of accelerations]. [Fetal presenting part is high and not engaged]. Vital signs: [maternal heart rate is 88 beats/min] and [blood pressure is 118/74 mmHg].\nR: Suspect placenta previa. Will continue to monitor maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate. Will NOT perform a vaginal exam. Prepare for possible ultrasound to confirm diagnosis. Notify provider.\n\nThe client reports [sudden onset of bright red vaginal bleeding] that began while they were resting. The client reports that there is [no abdominal pain or cramping]. Upon assessment, the nurse finds the [uterus is soft and nontender]. Fetal heart rate monitoring show a [baseline of 140/min with moderate variability] and [presence of accelerations].

    "correct": "Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment, partially or completely covering the cervical os. This abnormal placement predisposes the client to painless, bright red vaginal bleeding, especially in the third trimester as the lower uterine segment thins and contracts. The absence of pain is due to the bleeding originating from placental vessels rather than uterine contractions or trauma. A soft, nontender uterus is characteristic because there is no uterine irritability or contractions associated with the bleeding. Fetal heart rate (FHR) initially remains normal because the bleeding is maternal, not fetal. A high presenting part is expected as the placenta obstructs the fetal descent.",
    "incorrect": "Normal vital signs and a normal fetal heart rate tracing, while reassuring, are not specific diagnostic cues for placenta previa. They are important for differentiating placenta previa from placental abruption, where maternal vital signs may be unstable and fetal distress is more likely. The absence of trauma is a pertinent negative finding but not a direct indicator of placenta previa.",
    "clinicalPearls": "NEVER perform a vaginal exam on a client with undiagnosed vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. This can disrupt the placenta and cause severe hemorrhage if placenta previa is present. Ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosis. Betamethasone may be administered to promote fetal lung maturity if delivery is anticipated before 37 weeks.",
    "questionTrap": "A rigid, painful uterus points towards placental abruption, not placenta previa. Remember, 'painless bleeding' is the key differentiator.",
