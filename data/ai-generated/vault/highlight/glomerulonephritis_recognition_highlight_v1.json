    "correct": "Acute Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is an inflammatory response in the glomeruli following a recent streptococcal infection (typically pharyngitis or skin infection). The latent period is usually 1-3 weeks. The highlighted findings are consistent with APSGN due to the following pathophysiology: \n\n*   **'Smoky' or tea-colored urine (hematuria):** Inflammation and damage to the glomerular capillaries cause red blood cells to leak into the urine.\n*   **Periorbital edema:** Decreased GFR leads to fluid retention, initially manifesting as periorbital edema due to the loose tissue around the eyes.\n*   **Hypertension (142/96 mmHg):** Fluid volume overload and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to increased blood pressure.\n*   **Lethargy and Headache:** These symptoms can result from fluid volume excess, electrolyte imbalances, and potential hypertensive encephalopathy.\n*   **Mildly distended abdomen:** Ascites can develop due to fluid shifting into the peritoneal space secondary to decreased oncotic pressure and increased hydrostatic pressure.\n*   **Bilateral 1+ pretibial edema:** Generalized edema occurs as fluid accumulates in the interstitial spaces due to decreased GFR and sodium retention.\n*   **Proteinuria (0.5 to 2.0 g):** Glomerular damage increases permeability, allowing protein to leak into the urine. Note that the proteinuria in APSGN is typically less severe than in nephrotic syndrome.\n*   **Visible hematuria:** Macroscopic blood in the urine, resulting from glomerular capillary damage.\n*   **Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR):** Inflammation and obstruction within the glomeruli reduce the kidney's ability to filter waste products.\n*   **Positive antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer:** Indicates a recent streptococcal infection, confirming the etiology of APSGN.\n*   **Weight gain (1.5 kg):** Rapid weight gain over a short period is a strong indicator of fluid retention.",
    "incorrect": "The child's age and the history of a sore throat are contextual factors that increase suspicion for APSGN but are not direct assessment findings. The highlighted findings directly reflect the physiological consequences of the disease process.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Clinical Pearl: Early recognition of APSGN is crucial to prevent complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, and heart failure. Monitor blood pressure closely and manage fluid balance.",
    "questionTrap": "Distinguishing between glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome is key. Glomerulonephritis typically presents with hematuria (tea-colored urine), while nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria (frothy urine).",

    "recommendation": "Continue monitoring vital signs, especially blood pressure. Strict intake and output monitoring. Assess for signs of worsening edema or hypertensive encephalopathy. Consult nephrology for further management and potential need for diuretics or antihypertensives. Consider sodium and fluid restriction based on renal function and fluid status."
