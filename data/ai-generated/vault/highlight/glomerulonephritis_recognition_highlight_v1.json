Cues include 'smoky' or tea-colored urine (hematuria), periorbital edema (often the first sign), hypertension (from fluid retention), and oliguria. Symptoms like lethargy, headache, and abdominal distension result from fluid volume excess and potential hypertensive encephalopathy. Laboratory markers include proteinuria, decreased GFR, and evidence of previous strep infection (positive ASO titer). Rapid weight gain also indicates edema/fluid retention.",
