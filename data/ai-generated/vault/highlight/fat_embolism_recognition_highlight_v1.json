Vital signs show a [heart rate of 128 beats/min] and [respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min]. The client's [oxygen saturation has dropped from 98% to 89%] on room air. Upon physical assessment, the nurse observes [fine, pinpoint red-purple spots] across the [client's chest and neck]. The client reports a [feeling of impending doom]. Auscultation of the lungs reveals [fine crackles] in the bases. The client is [increasingly confused] and [unable to follow simple commands].",

        "correct": "Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) typically occurs 24-72 hours after long bone fractures. The classic triad includes Respiratory distress (tachycardia, tachypnea, low O2, crackles), Neurological dysfunction (restlessness, agitation, confusion), and Petechial rash (pinpoint red-purple spots on chest/neck). A feeling of impending doom is common in embolic events. Petechiae are a late but highly specific sign of FES.",
