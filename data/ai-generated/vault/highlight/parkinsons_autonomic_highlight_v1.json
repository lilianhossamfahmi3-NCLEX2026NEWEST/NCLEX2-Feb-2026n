  "passage": "A 74-year-old client with Parkinson's disease is being evaluated. The client exhibits a [shuffling gait] and a [pill-rolling tremor] at rest. The caregiver reports the client often becomes [lightheaded when standing] from a seated position. The nurse observes that the client's [skin is extremely oily and greasy] (seborrhea). The client reports [significant constipation] and having a bowel movement only twice a week. Assessment reveals [excessive salivation and drooling] (sialorrhea). The client also mentions [difficulty with bladder emptying] and [profuse sweating] without exertion. During the meal, the client [coughs frequently] and [requires a long time to chew and swallow].",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. \n\n*   **Lightheaded when standing (Orthostatic Hypotension):** Impaired baroreceptor reflex due to ANS degeneration leads to decreased blood pressure upon standing. The body's compensatory mechanisms (increased heart rate, vasoconstriction) are blunted, causing cerebral hypoperfusion and lightheadedness. \n*   **Oily and greasy skin (Seborrhea):** Dysregulation of the ANS affects sebaceous gland activity, leading to increased sebum production. This is due to imbalanced sympathetic and parasympathetic control over glandular secretions.\n*   **Significant constipation:** Reduced gastrointestinal motility results from impaired parasympathetic innervation of the bowel. Dopamine deficiency in the enteric nervous system also contributes, slowing peristalsis and leading to infrequent bowel movements.\n*   **Excessive salivation and drooling (Sialorrhea):** Impaired swallowing reflexes and reduced autonomic control of salivary glands cause saliva to accumulate in the mouth. The normal automatic swallowing mechanism is impaired.\n*   **Difficulty with bladder emptying:** ANS dysfunction affects bladder muscle control and sphincter function. This can lead to urinary retention, incomplete bladder emptying, and increased risk of urinary tract infections. Impaired detrusor muscle contractility and/or sphincter dyssynergia are the underlying mechanisms.\n*   **Profuse sweating:** Dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to excessive sweating, even without exertion or elevated body temperature. The thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus is affected, causing inappropriate activation of sweat glands.\n*   **Coughs frequently and requires a long time to chew and swallow (Dysphagia):** Impaired coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing, partly due to autonomic dysfunction affecting esophageal motility and lower esophageal sphincter function. This increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.\n\n",
    "incorrect": "Shuffling gait and pill-rolling tremors are hallmark motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, resulting from dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal pathway. These are not primarily related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.",
    "clinicalPearls": "*   Orthostatic hypotension is a major safety concern in Parkinson's disease. Implement fall precautions, such as teaching the client to change positions slowly and use assistive devices.\n*   Sialorrhea can lead to skin breakdown around the mouth. Provide frequent oral care and consider medications to reduce saliva production.\n*   Constipation can be managed with increased fiber intake, fluids, and stool softeners. Monitor bowel movements regularly.\n*   Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Refer the client to a speech therapist for swallowing evaluation and strategies.\n*   Non-pharmacological interventions for hyperhidrosis include wearing breathable clothing and using absorbent powders.",
