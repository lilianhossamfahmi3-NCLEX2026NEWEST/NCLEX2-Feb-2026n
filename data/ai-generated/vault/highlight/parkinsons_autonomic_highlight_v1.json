The caregiver reports the client often becomes [lightheaded when standing] from a seated position. The nurse observes that the client's [skin is extremely oily and greasy] (seborrhea). The client reports [significant constipation] and having a bowel movement only twice a week. Assessment reveals [excessive salivation and drooling] (sialorrhea). The client also mentions [difficulty with bladder emptying] and [profuse sweating] without exertion. During the meal, the client [coughs frequently] and [requires a long time to chew and swallow].",

        "correct": "While shuffling gait and pill-rolling tremors are hallmark motor signs of Parkinson's, the user requested autonomic findings. These include orthostatic hypotension (lightheaded on standing), seborrhea (oily skin), constipation (slowed GI motility), sialorrhea (dysautonomia of salivation), bladder dysfunction, and diaphoresis (profuse sweating). Dysphagia (coughing while eating, slow chewing) also has a large autonomic component in Parkinson's.",
        "incorrect": "Shuffling gait and pill-rolling tremors are motor (nigrostriatal) symptoms, not autonomic symptoms.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Orthostatic hypotension is a major safety risk in Parkinson's, potentially leading to falls. Drooling is not just excess saliva but also a decreased frequency of automatic swallowing.",
