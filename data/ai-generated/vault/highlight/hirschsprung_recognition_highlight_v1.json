The infant has a history of [chronic constipation] and [infrequent, foul-smelling, ribbon-like stools]. Upon assessment, the nurse notes [marked abdominal distension] and [visible peristaltic waves] on the abdomen. During a rectal examination, the physician notes a [lack of stool in the rectum] followed by a [sudden 'blast' of liquid stool] when the finger is withdrawn. The infant has [poor weight gain] and is [reluctant to feed]. The nurse also notes [vomiting of green, bile-stained material].",

    "correct": "Hirschsprung disease results from the failure of neural crest cells to migrate completely during gestation, leading to the absence of ganglion cells (aganglionosis) in a segment of the colon, most commonly the rectosigmoid region. This absence disrupts peristalsis, causing a functional obstruction. The affected bowel segment cannot relax, leading to chronic constipation and proximal bowel dilation. Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours is a key early indicator. The characteristic ribbon-like stools result from the stool being forced through the narrowed segment. Abdominal distension and visible peristaltic waves are signs of bowel obstruction. The 'blast' sign occurs because the digital rectal exam stimulates peristalsis in the unaffected bowel, resulting in a forceful expulsion of accumulated stool and gas. Poor weight gain, reluctance to feed, and bile-stained vomiting are consequences of chronic intestinal obstruction and malabsorption.",
    "incorrect": "While failure to thrive is present, it is a consequence of the disease process, not a primary diagnostic indicator. The highlighted findings are the direct manifestations of the underlying pathophysiology of Hirschsprung disease.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Remember the 'blast' sign is not always present, but highly suggestive when observed. Always consider Hirschsprung disease in infants with delayed meconium passage and chronic constipation. A rectal biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test. Pre-operative management includes bowel irrigation to relieve obstruction and prevent enterocolitis.",
    "questionTrap": "While vomiting is present, it is important to note the bile-stained emesis is a key indicator of bowel obstruction. Simple regurgitation or spitting up is common in infants, but bilious vomiting is always a red flag.",

    "background": "The infant has a history of failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours, chronic constipation, and infrequent, foul-smelling, ribbon-like stools. Assessment reveals marked abdominal distension and visible peristaltic waves. Rectal exam showed lack of stool followed by a 'blast' of liquid stool. The infant has poor weight gain, is reluctant to feed, and vomits green, bile-stained material.",
    "assessment": "The infant exhibits signs and symptoms highly suggestive of Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon). Key findings include delayed meconium passage, ribbon-like stools, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting.",
    "recommendation": "I recommend immediate consultation with a pediatric surgeon and gastroenterologist. A rectal biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Initiate bowel decompression and prepare the infant for potential surgical intervention. Monitor vital signs, abdominal girth, and stool output closely. NPO status should be maintained until further orders are received. Start IV fluids for hydration. Notify provider of any changes in condition."
