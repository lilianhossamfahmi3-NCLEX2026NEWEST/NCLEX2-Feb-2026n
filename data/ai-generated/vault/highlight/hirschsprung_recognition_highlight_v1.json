The infant has a history of [chronic constipation] and [infrequent, foul-smelling, ribbon-like stools]. Upon assessment, the nurse notes [marked abdominal distension] and [visible peristaltic waves] on the abdomen. During a rectal examination, the physician notes a [lack of stool in the rectum] followed by a [sudden 'blast' of liquid stool] when the finger is withdrawn. The infant has [poor weight gain] and is [reluctant to feed]. The nurse also notes [vomiting of green, bile-stained material].",

        "correct": "Hirschsprung disease is the absence of ganglion cells in the colon. Classic cues include failure to pass meconium (80% of cases), ribbon-like stools, abdominal distension, and bile-stained vomiting. The 'blast' sign (sudden expulsion of gas and liquid stool after digital exam) is very characteristic. Growth failure and visible peristalsis are also consistent with chronic intestinal obstruction.",
