Auscultation reveals hyperactive bowel sounds in upper quadrants, hypoactive in lower. Rectal exam revealed no stool present. Temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F), HR 170, RR 55 with mild grunting, BP 70/40. Notified Dr. Smith, awaiting orders. Will continue to monitor vital signs and abdominal assessment. Placed on NPO.\n\n2026-07-24 07:30\nIV access established. NS bolus initiated per order. Oxygen applied via nasal cannula at 2L/min. Continuous monitoring in place."
