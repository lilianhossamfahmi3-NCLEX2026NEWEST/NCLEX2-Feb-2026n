Vital signs show a blood pressure of [88/44 mmHg] and a heart rate of [124 beats/min]. Laboratory results show a serum [glucose of 1,150 mg/dL], [absent serum ketones], and a calculated [serum osmolality of 350 mOsm/kg]. The client's [urine output is 15 mL/hr].",

        "correct": "HHS is characterized by extreme hyperglycemia (>600), hyperosmolality (>320), and severe dehydration without significant ketoacidosis. Confusion, dry membranes, and sunken eyes indicate profound dehydration. Hypotension and tachycardia (88/44, 124) indicate hypovolemic shock. High glucose (1,150) and osmolality (350) are diagnostic. Absent ketones and lack of fruity breath distinguish HHS from DKA. Low urine output (15 mL/hr) indicates impaired renal perfusion from dehydration.",
