The client reports a persistent headache that did not improve with acetaminophen. She also mentions seeing 'spots' in front of her eyes this morning. Blood pressure is currently 164/104 mmHg. The nurse notes 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally with 1 beat of clonus. The client reports that the baby is moving frequently today. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein on a dipstick.",
