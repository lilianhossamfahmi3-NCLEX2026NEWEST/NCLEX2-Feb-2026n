The client reports a persistent headache that did not improve with acetaminophen. She also mentions seeing 'spots' in front of her eyes this morning. Blood pressure is currently 164/104 mmHg. The nurse notes 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally with 1 beat of clonus. The client reports that the baby is moving frequently today. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein on a dipstick.",

These findings indicate end-organ damage and increased risk for complications such as seizures (eclampsia), stroke, and HELLP syndrome. The elevated blood pressure results from widespread vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction, leading to decreased organ perfusion. The headache and visual changes are due to cerebral edema and vasospasm. Hyperreflexia and clonus indicate central nervous system irritability. Proteinuria reflects glomerular damage, allowing protein to leak into the urine.",
        "incorrect": "Gestational hypertension is the client's past medical history and provides context, but it is not indicative of *severe* preeclampsia. While 2+ pitting edema is common in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and venous pressure, it is no longer a primary diagnostic criterion for preeclampsia severity. Frequent fetal movement is generally a reassuring sign of fetal well-being, suggesting adequate fetal oxygenation at this time. However, it does not negate the concerning maternal symptoms.",
