    "passage": "A 62-year-old client, 2 days post-hip replacement, reports [sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain] that worsens with deep breathing. The nurse observes that the client is [suddenly dyspneic] and [extremely anxious]. Vital signs show a [respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min] and [heart rate of 122 beats/min]. The [oxygen saturation is 86%] on room air. The client has a [dry, nonproductive cough] and reports [feeling faint]. Physical exam reveals [tachycardia] and [crackles in the lung bases]. The nurse also notes [hemoptysis] (blood-tinged sputum) and [distended neck veins]. The [left calf is edematous, warm, and tender] to palpation.",

        "correct": "PE is a blockage of pulmonary arteries by a thrombus (usually from a DVT). Cues include sudden pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, anxiety, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Hemoptysis and JVD (signs of right heart strain) are also key markers. A feeling of faintness can occur with significant obstructions. The presence of unilateral calf edema/tenderness points strongly to a source DVT. Sudden pleuritic pain in a post-op client should always trigger suspicion of PE.",
        "incorrect": "The age of the client and the history of hip replacement are risk factors but not the acute assessment findings of the PE itself.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The diagnostic test of choice for PE is a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). D-dimer is helpful for ruling out PE but is often elevated in post-op clients regardless of PE.",
        "questionTrap": "Pleuritic chest pain (sharp, worsens with breath) is characteristic of PE, distinguishing it from the 'pressure' or 'squeezing' pain of an MI.",
