The nurse observes that the client is [suddenly dyspneic] and [extremely anxious]. Vital signs show a [respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min] and [heart rate of 122 beats/min]. The [oxygen saturation is 86%] on room air. The client has a [dry, nonproductive cough] and reports [feeling faint]. Physical exam reveals [tachycardia] and [crackles in the lung bases]. The nurse also notes [hemoptysis] (blood-tinged sputum) and [distended neck veins]. The [left calf is edematous, warm, and tender] to palpation.",

    "correct": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot, most commonly originating from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, travels to the pulmonary arteries and obstructs blood flow. This obstruction leads to a cascade of physiological consequences. Sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain arises from the inflammatory response and irritation of the pleura due to the embolism. Dyspnea results from impaired gas exchange as the blocked pulmonary arteries reduce the surface area available for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Anxiety is a common response to the sensation of breathlessness and chest pain. Tachypnea (RR 32) and tachycardia (HR 122) are compensatory mechanisms to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Hypoxemia (SpO2 86%) reflects the ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by the blocked pulmonary arteries. A dry, nonproductive cough can occur due to irritation of the airways. Feeling faint (syncope or near-syncope) suggests significant hemodynamic compromise. Tachycardia is a direct result of the body attempting to compensate for decreased oxygenation. Crackles in the lung bases may indicate pulmonary edema secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Hemoptysis results from pulmonary infarction and alveolar hemorrhage. Distended neck veins indicate right ventricular strain and increased central venous pressure due to the obstruction in the pulmonary circulation. Unilateral calf edema, warmth, and tenderness strongly suggest a DVT, the likely source of the PE.",
    "incorrect": "While age and recent hip replacement are risk factors for DVT and PE, they are not the acute assessment findings that directly indicate a PE. Focusing on the client's immediate symptoms is crucial for prompt recognition and intervention.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Remember the Virchow's triad for PE risk: stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. In a post-operative patient presenting with sudden chest pain and dyspnea, always suspect PE. Early recognition and intervention are critical to improving patient outcomes. The gold standard diagnostic test is a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Anticoagulation is the primary treatment.",
    "questionTrap": "While chest pain is a prominent symptom, the pleuritic nature (worsening with breathing) is a key differentiator from cardiac chest pain. Don't be misled by the presence of a cough; the sudden onset and association with other respiratory symptoms are more indicative of PE.",

    "background": "The client has a history of recent surgery, increasing the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). The client is reporting sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep breathing.",

The client has a dry, nonproductive cough, feels faint, and exhibits tachycardia, crackles in the lung bases, hemoptysis, distended neck veins, and left calf edema with warmth and tenderness.",
    "recommendation": "I recommend immediate evaluation for pulmonary embolism, including ordering a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and starting the client on supplemental oxygen. Consider initiating anticoagulation therapy as per protocol. Please assess the client urgently and provide further orders. I will continue to monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation closely."
