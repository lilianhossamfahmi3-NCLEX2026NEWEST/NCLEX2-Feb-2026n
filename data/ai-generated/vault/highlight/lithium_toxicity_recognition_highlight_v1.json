The nurse notes the client has a [coarse hand tremor] and is [stumbling when they walk] (ataxia). Assessment reveals the client is [increasingly confused] and is [slurring their speech]. The client reports [persistent blurred vision] and [ringing in the ears] (tinnitus). Physical exam shows [hyperreflexia] and [muscle twitching]. The client also reports [passing large amounts of dilute urine]. A STAT serum lithium level is [2.4 mEq/L].",

    "correct": "Lithium's narrow therapeutic index (0.6-1.2 mEq/L) makes toxicity a significant concern. Levels exceeding 1.5 mEq/L indicate toxicity. Gastrointestinal (GI) distress, such as diarrhea and vomiting, are often early indicators. Moderate to severe toxicity (levels >2.0 mEq/L) manifests with pronounced neurological symptoms. Ataxia (impaired coordination), a coarse hand tremor (distinct from the fine tremor seen at therapeutic doses), confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes) are all characteristic. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, leading to polyuria (excessive urination) with dilute urine, can also develop due to lithium's interference with the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine. A serum lithium level of 2.4 mEq/L is critically elevated, demanding immediate intervention. The pathophysiology involves lithium's interference with sodium transport in nerve and muscle cells, leading to neuronal dysfunction and the observed neurological and GI symptoms. Chronic lithium use can also affect the kidneys' ability to respond to ADH, causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",
    "incorrect": "The client's age and history of bipolar disorder provide context but are not direct indicators of lithium toxicity.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Dehydration and hyponatremia (low sodium levels) are major risk factors for lithium toxicity. The kidneys compensate for low sodium by retaining lithium, leading to elevated serum levels. Emphasize the importance of consistent fluid and salt intake to clients on lithium therapy. Monitor for drug interactions (e.g., NSAIDs, diuretics) that can increase lithium levels.",
    "questionTrap": "While a fine hand tremor is a common side effect of lithium at therapeutic doses, a COARSE hand tremor is a key sign of lithium toxicity.",

      "background": "The client has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently prescribed lithium carbonate. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, requiring close monitoring to prevent toxicity. The client's recent symptoms raise concern for elevated lithium levels.",
      "assessment": "The client exhibits signs and symptoms indicative of moderate to severe lithium toxicity, including diarrhea, vomiting, coarse hand tremor, ataxia, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, tinnitus, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, polyuria, and a serum lithium level of 2.4 mEq/L.",
      "recommendation": "Hold the lithium dose immediately. Notify the provider STAT. Anticipate orders for IV fluids (normal saline), electrolyte monitoring (especially sodium and potassium), and possible dialysis if the client's condition worsens. Monitor vital signs, neurological status, lithium levels, and renal function closely. Obtain an ECG to assess for cardiac effects of lithium toxicity."
