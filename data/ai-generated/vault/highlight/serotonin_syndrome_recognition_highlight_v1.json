Vital signs reveal a [temperature of 102.4°F], [heart rate of 118 beats/min], and [blood pressure of 162/94 mmHg]. Physical exam shows [hyperreflexia] and [spontaneous muscle clonus] in the lower extremities. The nurse observes [shivering and tremors] during the interview. The client reports [abdominal cramping and diarrhea]. When checking the eyes, the nurse notes [dilated pupils] (mydriasis). The client is [increasingly confused] and [disoriented to time].",

        "correct": "Serotonin syndrome results from excess serotonin. Cues are categorized into: 1. Mental status changes (agitation, confusion, disorientation). 2. Autonomic hyperactivity (fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis, diarrhea). 3. Neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus, tremors, shivering). The combination of an SSRI (sertraline) and tramadol (which has serotonergic properties) is a classic drug-drug interaction cause.",
