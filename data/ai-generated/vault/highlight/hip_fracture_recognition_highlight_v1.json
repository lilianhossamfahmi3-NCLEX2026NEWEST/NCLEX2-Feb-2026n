  "passage": "An 82-year-old female is brought to the emergency department at 1400 after falling in her kitchen. She reports severe pain in her right groin and hip area. While the patient is lying supine, the nurse observes that the right leg is shorter than the left leg. The right foot is also turned outward (externally rotated). The nurse notes a large area of ecchymosis over the right greater trochanter. The nurse checks the patient's pedal pulses and finds them to be 2+ and equal bilaterally. The patient's skin is warm and dry. The client denies any numbness or tingling in her toes.",

    "correct": "The classic presentation of a hip fracture includes shortening of the affected limb and external rotation of the foot due to muscle spasms and displacement at the fracture site. Ecchymosis over the greater trochanter is also a common physical finding resulting from bleeding into the surrounding tissues. These signs are indicative of disruption to the structural integrity of the hip joint.",
    "incorrect": "Symmetric pedal pulses and warm/dry skin are normal neurovascular findings, indicating adequate perfusion to the lower extremities, and do not indicate a fracture. Absence of numbness/tingling is a distractor, as it suggests intact nerve function, which is not directly related to the presence of a hip fracture.",
