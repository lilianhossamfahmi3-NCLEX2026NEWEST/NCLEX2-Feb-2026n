    "passage": "An 82-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after falling in her kitchen. She reports severe pain in her right groin and hip area. While the patient is lying supine, the nurse observes that the right leg is shorter than the left leg. The right foot is also turned outward (externally rotated). The nurse notes a large area of ecchymosis over the right greater trochanter. The nurse checks the patient's pedal pulses and finds them to be 2+ and equal bilaterally. The patient's skin is warm and dry. The client denies any numbness or tingling in her toes.",
