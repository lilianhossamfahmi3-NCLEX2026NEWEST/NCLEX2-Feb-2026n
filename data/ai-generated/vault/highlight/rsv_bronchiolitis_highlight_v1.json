    "passage": "An 8-month-old infant is brought to the urgent care clinic by her father. The father reports that the child has a 'runny nose and a cough' for 2 days. Today, the father noticed that the child is 'breathing very fast and is not interested in her bottle.' Physical assessment reveals subcostal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral expiratory wheezing and fine crackles. The infant's respiratory rate is 64 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The child is currently sleeping in her father's arms. Nasal flaring is noted when the infant is disturbed.",

        "correct": "Significant respiratory distress in an infant is characterized by tachypnea (RR >60), decreased oral intake, retractions (subcostal/intercostal), adventitious breath sounds (wheezing/crackles), hypoxia (SpO2 <92% for most clinical protocols), and nasal flaring. These signs indicate the infant's compensatory mechanisms are failing to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The increased respiratory rate reflects the body's attempt to compensate for impaired gas exchange. Retractions demonstrate increased work of breathing as the infant uses accessory muscles to draw air into the lungs. Nasal flaring is another sign of increased effort to reduce airway resistance. Hypoxia indicates inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.",
        "incorrect": "A runny nose and cough are common upper respiratory symptoms, but alone do not indicate severe distress. Sleeping in a parent's arms, while potentially concerning if accompanied by other symptoms, is not a definitive sign of respiratory distress unless the infant is difficult to arouse or exhibits other concerning signs. These findings need to be considered in conjunction with objective measures of respiratory function.",

Infant is sleeping in father's arms but arousable.\nRecommendation: Initiate oxygen therapy via nasal cannula or face mask to maintain SpO2 >92%. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Notify the provider immediately with vital signs and assessment findings. Obtain orders for RSV testing and possible bronchodilator therapy. Consider chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia."
