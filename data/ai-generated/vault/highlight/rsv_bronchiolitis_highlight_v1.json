    "passage": "An 8-month-old infant is brought to the urgent care clinic by her father. The father reports that the child has a 'runny nose and a cough' for 2 days. Today, the father noticed that the child is 'breathing very fast and is not interested in her bottle.' Physical assessment reveals subcostal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral expiratory wheezing and fine crackles. The infant's respiratory rate is 64 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The child is currently sleeping in her father's arms. Nasal flaring is noted when the infant is disturbed.",
