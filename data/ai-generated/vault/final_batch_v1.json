On this U-100 syringe, the interval between 20 and 30 units contains four lines, meaning each line represents 2 units (10 units / 5 spaces = 2 units/space). Underdosing with 22 units instead of the required 24 would reduce the amount of insulin available to facilitate glucose transport into cells. This insufficiency can lead to post-prandial or fasting hyperglycemia, increasing the risk of osmotic diuresis and, over time, contributing to microvascular complications like nephropathy and retinopathy."

                "content": "Correct. The syringe markings are in 2-unit increments. The top ring of the plunger is aligned with the second line past the 20-unit mark. Therefore, the dose is calculated as 20 units + (2 lines × 2 units/line) = 24 units. Administering the precise dose of NPH, an intermediate-acting insulin, is critical for mimicking basal insulin secretion. An accurate dose prevents both hyperglycemia from underdosing and, more acutely, iatrogenic hypoglycemia from overdosing, which can cause neuroglycopenia and lead to seizures or coma."

Administering an overdose of 26 units when 24 is required would cause an excessive drop in blood glucose. The excess insulin molecules would bind to more receptors on hepatocytes, muscle, and adipose tissue, driving supraphysiological amounts of glucose out of the bloodstream. This significantly elevates the risk of hypoglycemia, especially during NPH's peak action time (4-12 hours post-injection), which can manifest as diaphoresis, tachycardia, and confusion."

A 4-unit overdose of NPH insulin poses a severe risk of prolonged and profound hypoglycemia. The brain relies almost exclusively on glucose for energy; depriving it of this substrate can cause irreversible neurological damage. The increased insulin load would potently suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, removing the body's primary defenses against falling blood glucose levels and potentially leading to a medical emergency."

This syringe has 2-unit increments. The second trap is reading from the wrong part of the plunger; measurement must be taken from the top flat ring of the plunger, not the pointed tip or the bottom ring.",
            "whyItIsATrap": "Nurses frequently use different types of syringes, and making an assumption about the scale based on familiarity with another device is a common source of cognitive error. This 'automaticity' bypasses the critical safety check of actively verifying the scale's increments, leading directly to medication dosage errors with significant pathophysiological consequences."
