Precise dosing prevents hyperglycemia (underdosing) and iatrogenic hypoglycemia (overdosing), which can cause neuroglycopenia, seizures, or coma. SBAR: Situation: Pt needs 24u NPH at 0800.

Excess insulin binds to receptors on hepatocytes, muscle, and adipose tissue, driving supraphysiological amounts of glucose out of the bloodstream.

A 4-unit overdose of NPH insulin poses a severe risk of prolonged and profound hypoglycemia. The brain relies almost exclusively on glucose; depriving it can cause irreversible neurological damage. Increased insulin potently suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, removing the body's defenses against falling blood glucose, potentially leading to a medical emergency.
