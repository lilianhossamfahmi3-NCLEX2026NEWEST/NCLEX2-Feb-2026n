Heart rate is 160, respiratory rate is 40. The anterior fontanel is sunken. Capillary refill is 3 seconds.\nRecommendation: I recommend initiating an IV fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg normal saline. Monitor urine output and vital signs closely. Consider obtaining serum electrolytes to assess the extent of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance."
