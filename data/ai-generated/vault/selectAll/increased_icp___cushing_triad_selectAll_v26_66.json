        "text": "Bradycardia",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Bradycardia is a key component of Cushing's Triad, a physiological response to acute elevations of intracranial pressure (ICP). The pressure on the vasomotor center in the medulla causes an increase in systemic blood pressure, leading to a reflex bradycardia mediated by the vagus nerve. This compensatory mechanism attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion despite the increased ICP."

        "text": "Hypotension",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Hypotension is not typically associated with increased ICP in the early stages. The body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) by increasing the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Hypotension, if present, usually indicates impending herniation or a decompensated state where compensatory mechanisms have failed."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Irregular respirations, such as Cheyne-Stokes or ataxic breathing patterns, are indicative of increased ICP. The pressure on the brainstem disrupts the normal respiratory control centers, leading to erratic and unpredictable breathing patterns. These patterns reflect impaired function of the medulla and pons."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Hypertension with a widening pulse pressure is a classic sign of Cushing's Triad. As ICP rises, the body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing the systolic blood pressure, leading to a widening difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures. This is a critical compensatory mechanism to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Tachycardia is generally not associated with increased ICP, especially when Cushing's Triad is present. The reflex bradycardia is a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance the increased blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Tachycardia may be present in other conditions, such as hypovolemia or pain, but not typically in the setting of acutely elevated ICP."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Pupil constriction (miosis) is typically associated with opioid use or pontine lesions. In the setting of increased ICP, pupillary changes usually manifest as dilation (mydriasis), especially on the side of the lesion or compression of the oculomotor nerve (CN III). Pupil constriction is an unexpected finding."

      "SBAR": "Situation: J.B. is a 68-year-old male admitted for a closed head injury after a fall at home at 07:00. Background: Patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He initially presented with a GCS of 14, but has since declined. Assessment: At 09:00, the patient's GCS is now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5). Vitals: BP 180/70 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10 and irregular. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil dilated and sluggishly reactive to light. The patient is responsive to pain only. A CT scan was ordered STAT. At 09:15, the CT scan results are pending. The nursing staff reports the patient is now exhibiting posturing to noxious stimuli. Recommendation: The healthcare provider should prepare for possible interventions to reduce ICP, including possible intubation and administration of osmotic diuretics. The patient's neurological status warrants immediate action to prevent further deterioration and potential brain herniation. Frequent monitoring of vitals and neurological assessments is essential. Contact neurosurgery for further guidance.",
