Increased ICP compresses the vasomotor center in the medulla, causing an increase in systemic blood pressure, leading to reflex bradycardia mediated by the vagus nerve. This compensatory mechanism attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion despite the increased ICP. The body reduces heart rate to manage the elevated blood pressure."

Cerebral perfusion cannot be maintained if blood pressure drops too low."

The pressure on the brainstem disrupts the normal respiratory control centers, leading to erratic and unpredictable breathing patterns. These patterns reflect impaired function of the medulla and pons. Changes in respiratory pattern are a direct result of pressure on the brainstem."

As ICP rises, the body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing the systolic blood pressure, leading to a widening difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures. This is a critical compensatory mechanism to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain. The body increases systolic pressure to overcome the increased intracranial pressure."

The reflex bradycardia is a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance the increased blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Tachycardia may be present in other conditions, such as hypovolemia or pain, but not typically in the setting of acutely elevated ICP. The body slows the heart rate to compensate for hypertension."

He initially presented with a GCS of 14, but has since declined. Assessment: At 09:00, the patient's GCS is now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5). Vitals: BP 180/70 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10 and irregular. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil dilated and sluggishly reactive to light. The patient is responsive to pain only. A CT scan was ordered STAT. At 09:15, the CT scan results are pending. The nursing staff reports the patient is now exhibiting posturing to noxious stimuli. Recommendation: The healthcare provider should prepare for possible interventions to reduce ICP, including possible intubation and administration of osmotic diuretics. The patient's neurological status warrants immediate action to prevent further deterioration and potential brain herniation. Frequent monitoring of vitals and neurological assessments is essential.

The classic signs of increased ICP include bradycardia, irregular respirations, and hypertension with a widening pulse pressure, collectively known as Cushing's Triad. These findings indicate the brain's compensatory mechanisms are failing, and herniation may be imminent. Bradycardia occurs due to increased pressure on the vagus nerve. Irregular respirations result from pressure on the brainstem's respiratory centers. Hypertension with widening pulse pressure is the body's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion. Other signs of increased ICP may include changes in level of consciousness, pupillary changes (dilation), and motor deficits. Prompt intervention is essential to prevent irreversible brain damage and improve patient outcomes. Clinical Pearl: Cushing's Triad is a LATE sign. Question Trap: Students may confuse tachycardia with increased ICP. Mnemonic: 'I-C-P' - Irregular respirations, Cushing's Triad, Pupil dilation."
