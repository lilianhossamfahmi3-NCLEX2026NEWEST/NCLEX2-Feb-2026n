It is most often seen in children and teenagers who are recovering from a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox, and who have taken aspirin. The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be related to the use of aspirin during a viral infection. Aspirin can damage the mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cells. This damage can lead to liver and brain swelling. The symptoms of Reye's syndrome can vary, but they often include vomiting, lethargy, confusion, seizures, and coma. There is no specific treatment for Reye's syndrome, but supportive care can help to manage the symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes.",

The child is lethargic and has been vomiting profusely since this morning.\nBackground: The child recently recovered from influenza A. The parents report administering aspirin for fever control during the illness, as they were unaware of the risks.\nAssessment: 0915: The child presents with persistent vomiting, lethargy, and altered mental status. Neurological assessment at 1000 reveals increasing confusion. Lab results available at 0915 show elevated serum ammonia levels (250 mcg/dL) and liver enzymes (AST: 500 U/L, ALT: 450 U/L). Blood glucose is 60 mg/dL.\nRecommendation: 1030: Continue to closely monitor neurological status and lab values. Immediately discontinue all aspirin and salicylate-containing products. Administer IV fluids with dextrose to correct hypoglycemia. Consider administering medications to reduce cerebral edema and consult with a pediatric neurologist and critical care specialist for further management, including possible transfer to a tertiary care center."
