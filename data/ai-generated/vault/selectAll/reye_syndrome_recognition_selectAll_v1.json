    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. A recent viral illness (influenza, varicella) is a key antecedent. The virus causes initial mitochondrial injury, predisposing the liver to severe damage when exposed to aspirin. This injury disrupts the urea cycle and fatty acid metabolism.",
      "rationale": "Viral infections, particularly influenza and varicella, can cause subclinical mitochondrial damage. This damage primes the liver for a catastrophic reaction when exposed to aspirin, leading to the characteristic liver and brain dysfunction of Reye Syndrome. The initial viral insult weakens the mitochondria, making them more susceptible to the toxic effects of salicylates."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Aspirin use during or shortly after a viral illness is strongly associated with Reye Syndrome. Aspirin metabolites directly damage mitochondria, impairing liver function and leading to hyperammonemia.",
      "rationale": "Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and its metabolites are directly toxic to mitochondria. They uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and inhibit beta-oxidation of fatty acids. This leads to an accumulation of fatty acids within hepatocytes (microvesicular steatosis), which severely impairs the liver's ability to detoxify ammonia via the urea cycle, resulting in hyperammonemia and encephalopathy."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Persistent vomiting and lethargy are early signs of cerebral edema and hepatic dysfunction. Vomiting is triggered by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and liver impairment. Lethargy results from neurotoxic effects of ammonia.",
      "rationale": "These are hallmark signs of developing cerebral edema and metabolic encephalopathy. Profuse vomiting is triggered by both hepatic dysfunction and rising intracranial pressure (ICP). Lethargy is a direct consequence of neurotoxic substances, primarily ammonia, crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing astrocyte swelling and neuronal dysfunction. The liver's inability to process ammonia leads to its accumulation in the bloodstream, exacerbating neurological symptoms."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Elevated serum ammonia and liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are critical diagnostic indicators of liver damage. Hyperammonemia is a primary driver of neurological symptoms.",
      "rationale": "These laboratory findings are central to the diagnosis. The release of AST and ALT into the bloodstream reflects acute hepatocellular injury. The elevated ammonia level (hyperammonemia) is a direct result of the damaged liver's inability to convert ammonia to urea, and it is the primary driver of the neurological symptoms. The liver's impaired function leads to a buildup of toxic metabolites in the blood."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. 'Strawberry tongue' and sandpaper-like rash are characteristic of Scarlet Fever or Kawasaki disease, not Reye Syndrome. These signs indicate a streptococcal infection or vasculitis.",
      "rationale": "A 'strawberry tongue' and sandpaper-like rash are pathognomonic for Scarlet Fever, a condition caused by toxins from a Group A Streptococcus infection. These signs can also be seen in Kawasaki disease. This finding points toward a different infectious or inflammatory process, not the metabolic crisis of Reye Syndrome. These findings are unrelated to the pathophysiology of Reye Syndrome, which primarily involves liver and brain dysfunction."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Altered mental status and seizures indicate severe cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hyperammonemia and metabolic disturbances.",
      "rationale": "This indicates a rapid progression to severe cerebral edema and high intracranial pressure. The accumulation of ammonia leads to astrocyte swelling, which increases brain volume. This, combined with systemic metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia, disrupts neuronal membrane potential, leading to uncontrolled electrical discharges (seizures) and profound changes in consciousness. The neurological symptoms are a direct result of the liver's inability to detoxify ammonia."
    }
  },
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing Reye Syndrome with other pediatric emergencies like meningitis or encephalitis, which also present with fever and altered mental status. The key differentiating cluster of cues for Reye Syndrome is the specific history of aspirin use during a viral illness, coupled with the rapid onset of profuse vomiting and laboratory evidence of acute liver failure (especially hyperammonemia) without significant jaundice.",

    "Educate parents about the dangers of giving aspirin to children and teenagers, especially during viral illnesses. Recommend alternative fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",
    "Monitor serum ammonia levels and liver enzymes (AST/ALT) closely in suspected cases of Reye Syndrome. Elevated levels indicate liver damage and support the diagnosis.",
