Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage and reduces ICP while minimizing hypotension in the LVAD patient. Stool softeners prevent straining, which increases ICP. Monitoring LVAD parameters ensures adequate cardiac output and cerebral perfusion. Antiplatelet medications prevent LVAD thrombosis. Frequent neurological assessments detect changes in neurological status. Aggressive coughing and clamping the LVAD outflow graft are contraindicated due to their detrimental effects on ICP and cardiac output, respectively. The nurse must integrate knowledge of both cardiovascular and neurological systems to provide optimal care."
