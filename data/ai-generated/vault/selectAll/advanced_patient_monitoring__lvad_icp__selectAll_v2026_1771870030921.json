    "stem": "You are caring for a 62-year-old male, Mr. Johnson, in the ICU who has both a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. Based on the provided information, which nursing interventions are MOST appropriate? Select all that apply.",

        "optionID": "optionA",
        "text": "Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. This is crucial in patients with elevated ICP to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). It also avoids sudden drops in preload that can be poorly tolerated by LVAD patients.",

        "optionID": "optionB",
        "text": "Administer prescribed stool softeners.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver) increases ICP. Stool softeners prevent constipation and reduce the risk of straining, thus minimizing ICP spikes. Patients with LVADs may also be on anticoagulants, and straining can increase the risk of bleeding.",

        "optionID": "optionC",
        "text": "Monitor LVAD flow rate and power consumption trends.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Changes in LVAD flow rate and power consumption can indicate pump malfunction, changes in preload or afterload, or the patient's hemodynamic status. Close monitoring allows for early detection of complications and timely intervention to maintain adequate cardiac output.",

        "optionID": "optionD",
        "text": "Encourage aggressive coughing and deep breathing exercises.",
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "While deep breathing is generally beneficial, aggressive coughing increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, leading to a transient increase in ICP. This is contraindicated in patients with elevated ICP. Gentle chest physiotherapy may be considered with caution.",
        "distractorReason": "This action increases ICP, which is detrimental to the patient's condition."

        "text": "Administer scheduled antiplatelet medication per MAR.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Patients with LVADs require antiplatelet therapy to prevent thrombus formation within the pump. Adhering to the medication schedule is essential for maintaining pump function and preventing thromboembolic complications. Disruption can lead to LVAD thrombosis and catastrophic patient outcomes.",

        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Regular neurological assessments are critical for monitoring changes in neurological status and detecting signs of increasing ICP. Pupillary response, level of consciousness, and motor function should be assessed and documented frequently. Neurological changes must be promptly reported.",

        "text": "Clamp the LVAD outflow graft during ambulation.",
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Clamping the LVAD outflow graft would immediately stop blood flow to the systemic circulation, causing catastrophic hemodynamic collapse and death. The LVAD provides essential circulatory support, and interrupting it is extremely dangerous.",
        "distractorReason": "This action would completely stop blood flow and cause immediate harm."

      "situation": "Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old male admitted for heart failure, status post LVAD implantation one week ago. He also has a history of a recent fall with a subdural hematoma requiring ICP monitoring. Current ICP is trending upward.",
      "background": "Patient's LVAD is set at 4.5 LPM. He is on aspirin 81mg daily. He has a ventriculostomy for ICP management. Baseline neuro exam: Alert, oriented x 3, PERRLA. Recent CT scan shows stable hematoma size.",
      "assessment": "At 0700, patient's ICP was 18 mmHg. At 0800, ICP is 22 mmHg. MAP is 85 mmHg. LVAD flow is stable. Patient reports a headache. Neuro exam: Slight decrease in alertness. Pupils are equal and reactive. No motor deficits noted. Vitals: HR 75, BP 110/70, RR 18, SpO2 98% on 2L NC.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend a neurology consult for the increasing ICP. Consider adjusting the ventriculostomy drainage. Please evaluate the need for further interventions to manage ICP and prevent neurological deterioration. Continue close monitoring of LVAD parameters and neurological status."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Patients with both LVADs and ICP monitors require meticulous monitoring and management to balance cardiac output and cerebral perfusion.",
      "Elevated ICP can be exacerbated by activities that increase intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pressure.",
      "Changes in LVAD parameters may indicate underlying hemodynamic issues affecting cerebral perfusion."

    "questionTrap": "Students may focus solely on either the LVAD or the ICP, missing the interplay between the two systems. Prioritizing interventions that address both the cardiac and neurological aspects is crucial.",
