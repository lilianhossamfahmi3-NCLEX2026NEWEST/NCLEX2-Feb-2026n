    "stem": "You are caring for a 62-year-old male patient, Mr. Jones, admitted to the ICU following a severe head trauma and subsequent placement of an intraventricular catheter for ICP monitoring and a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) for acute heart failure exacerbation. Based on the provided patient data, select all nursing interventions that are MOST appropriate for Mr. Jones at this time.",

        "text": "Maintain the head of the bed (HOB) at 30-45 degrees.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps to reduce ICP. A range of 30-45 degrees is typically recommended to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) without causing a significant drop in blood pressure, which is especially critical in patients with LVADs who are preload-dependent."

      {
        "optionID": "B",
        "text": "Administer prescribed stool softeners.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Straining during bowel movements can increase ICP. Stool softeners prevent constipation and reduce the Valsalva maneuver, which can transiently but significantly raise ICP. Furthermore, the physiological stress of straining can negatively impact cardiac function in a patient with an LVAD."

        "optionID": "C",
        "text": "Frequently assess neurological status, including pupillary response, level of consciousness (LOC), and motor function.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Neurological assessments are crucial for monitoring ICP and detecting any deterioration in brain function. Changes in pupillary response, LOC, or motor function may indicate increased ICP, requiring immediate intervention. These assessments also help differentiate between neurological changes and potential complications related to LVAD function."

      {
        "optionID": "D",
        "text": "Encourage aggressive coughing and deep breathing exercises every hour.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "While deep breathing exercises are generally beneficial, aggressive coughing can increase ICP. Therefore, these activities should be approached with caution and individualized to the patient's condition. The potential for increased intrathoracic pressure during coughing can impede LVAD function and venous return."

        "optionID": "E",
        "text": "Monitor LVAD parameters (flow, speed, pulsatility index) and correlate with hemodynamic status.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "LVAD parameters provide essential information about the device's function and the patient's hemodynamic status. Changes in flow, speed, or pulsatility index may indicate device malfunction, hypovolemia, or other complications that can affect both cardiac and cerebral perfusion. Correlating these parameters with blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is critical for optimizing LVAD management."

        "optionID": "F",
        "text": "Restrict fluids to 1000 mL per day to minimize ICP.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Fluid restriction can be detrimental, especially in patients with LVADs, as they are preload-dependent. Dehydration can reduce cardiac output and compromise cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Fluid management should be carefully individualized based on the patient's hemodynamic status and ICP readings, aiming for euvolemia rather than strict restriction."

      "background": "Patient has a history of hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Sustained head injury from a fall. Echocardiogram revealed severely reduced EF, necessitating LVAD support. Baseline ICP was 12 mmHg prior to LVAD initiation. Patient is intubated and sedated with propofol.",
      "assessment": "Current assessment at 0800: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 78 bpm (LVAD supported), ICP 18 mmHg, CPP 65 mmHg. Pupils are equal and reactive. Minimal response to pain. LVAD parameters: Flow 5 L/min, Speed 9000 RPM, PI 2.0. Urine output 30 mL/hr. Labs pending.",
      "recommendation": "Titrate propofol to maintain adequate sedation and ICP control. Monitor LVAD parameters and hemodynamics closely. Consider mannitol if ICP continues to rise despite current interventions. Obtain repeat CT head if neurological status deteriorates. Consult neurosurgery and cardiology for collaborative management."
