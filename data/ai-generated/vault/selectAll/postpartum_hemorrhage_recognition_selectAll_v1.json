  "answerBreakdown": {
    "a": {
      "content": "Correct. A boggy (soft, atonic) fundus indicates uterine atony, the most common cause of PPH. The myometrial muscle fibers fail to contract and compress the spiral arterioles at the placental implantation site, disrupting hemostasis. Displacement, often to the right, suggests a distended bladder, preventing uterine contraction. **Pathophysiology:** Uterine atony results from overdistension (multiple gestation, polyhydramnios), prolonged labor, grand multiparity, or use of certain medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate, oxytocin overuse). A full bladder occupies space, preventing the uterus from contracting effectively. **Clinical Pearl:** Always assess bladder distension when encountering a boggy fundus. Catheterization may be necessary.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "b": {
      "content": "Correct. Saturating a perineal pad in ≤15 minutes signifies excessive blood loss (>75-100 mL every 15 minutes). This rapid blood loss quickly exceeds the 500 mL (vaginal delivery) or 1000 mL (cesarean) threshold for PPH. **Pathophysiology:** This rate indicates active, ongoing bleeding, likely due to uterine atony, lacerations, or retained placental fragments. The body's compensatory mechanisms may be overwhelmed, leading to hypovolemic shock. **Clinical Pearl:** Quantify blood loss accurately. Weighing pads (1 g = 1 mL) provides a more precise estimate than visual assessment.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "c": {
      "content": "Correct. Passing a large clot (golf ball size, ~4.5 cm) is abnormal and suggests significant blood pooling in the uterus before expulsion. This indicates ongoing bleeding and potential uterine atony or retained placental fragments. **Pathophysiology:** Clots form when blood stagnates. Large clots suggest a significant volume of blood is accumulating in the uterus due to inadequate contraction or obstruction. Retained placental fragments interfere with uterine involution. **Clinical Pearl:** Document the size and number of clots. Inspect the placenta after delivery to ensure completeness.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "d": {
      "content": "Correct. Tachycardia (HR >100 bpm) is an early compensatory mechanism for hypovolemia. As blood volume decreases, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output and oxygen delivery to vital organs. **Pathophysiology:** Blood loss reduces venous return and cardiac output. Baroreceptors trigger the sympathetic nervous system, releasing catecholamines that increase heart rate and contractility. This is an attempt to maintain blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor heart rate trends closely. A sustained increase, even within the normal range, can be an early warning sign of PPH.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "e": {
      "content": "Incorrect. A firm, midline fundus at the umbilicus is a normal finding 4 hours postpartum. It indicates effective uterine contraction and hemostasis. This finding does NOT indicate PPH. **Pathophysiology:** A firm fundus signifies that the myometrial muscles are contracting effectively, compressing blood vessels at the placental site and preventing excessive bleeding. Midline position indicates the bladder is empty and not interfering with uterine contraction.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "f": {
      "content": "Correct. Lightheadedness and dizziness upon sitting up are symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, often caused by hypovolemia. Significant blood loss impairs the body's ability to compensate for gravitational fluid shifts. **Pathophysiology:** Reduced blood volume leads to decreased venous return and cardiac output. Upon standing, blood pools in the lower extremities, further reducing cerebral perfusion and causing dizziness. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess for orthostatic hypotension by measuring blood pressure and heart rate in supine, sitting, and standing positions.",

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Tachycardia vs. Hypotension: The First Responder",
    "content": "A critical trap is waiting for blood pressure to drop before suspecting hemorrhage. Hypotension is a late and ominous sign, indicating the failure of compensatory mechanisms. Tachycardia is the body's first and most sensitive hemodynamic response to volume loss. An increase of >20-30 bpm from baseline is a major red flag. Another pitfall is dismissing a 'golf ball' sized clot; any clot larger than a plum or lemon is a definitive sign, but a golf ball is a critical cue that warrants immediate fundal assessment and massage, as it indicates significant pooled blood from uterine atony."

The uterus fails to contract.\n* **T**rauma (Lacerations, Hematoma, Rupture): Injury to the cervix, vagina, or perineum.\n* **T**issue (Retained Placenta/Clots): Prevents the uterus from fully contracting.\n* **T**hrombin (Coagulopathy): Pre-existing or acquired clotting disorders (e.g., DIC, HELLP)."

    "assessment": "The client's fundus is boggy and displaced to the right. Her heart rate has increased from 78 to 112 bpm. She reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy when sitting up. She is saturating a perineal pad in 15 minutes or less and passed a tissue clot the size of a golf ball. Lochia is rubra. Vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air.

This includes fundal massage, bladder catheterization, notifying the healthcare provider, establishing IV access, administering uterotonic medications (e.g., oxytocin, misoprostol), and monitoring vital signs closely.
