        "a": {
            "content": "Correct. A boggy (atopic) fundus signifies failure of the myometrial muscle fibers to contract and compress the spiral arterioles at the placental implantation site, which is the primary mechanism of postpartum hemostasis. Displacement to the right is a classic sign of a distended urinary bladder, which acts as a physical obstruction, preventing the uterus from contracting firmly and effectively, thereby perpetuating the atony and hemorrhage."
        },
        "b": {
            "content": "Correct. This is a quantitative indicator of excessive, active bleeding. A standard perineal pad holds approximately 75-100 mL of blood. Saturating a pad in 15 minutes equates to a blood loss rate of 300-400 mL per hour. This rate rapidly leads to a cumulative blood loss exceeding the 1000 mL threshold for PPH, indicating severe, ongoing hemorrhage that requires immediate intervention."
        },
        "c": {
            "content": "Correct. The passage of a large clot (a golf ball is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter) is a significant finding. It indicates that blood has pooled in the uterine cavity due to atony before being expelled. This is not normal lochia. It signifies a large volume of sequestered blood and suggests an underlying, ongoing issue such as uterine atony or retained placental fragments that is causing the bleeding."
        },
        "d": {
            "content": "Correct. Tachycardia is one of the earliest compensatory mechanisms for hypovolemia. As intravascular volume decreases from blood loss, cardiac output and blood pressure begin to fall. Baroreceptors detect this change and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to release catecholamines. This results in an increased heart rate (chronotropic effect) to maintain cardiac output (CO = HR x SV) and perfuse vital organs. This finding is a sensitive, early indicator of circulatory compromise."
        },
        "e": {
            "content": "Incorrect. A firm, midline fundus at the umbilicus is the expected and desired finding 4 hours postpartum. 'Firm' indicates effective myometrial contraction, which compresses blood vessels and prevents hemorrhage. 'Midline' indicates the bladder is not distended and interfering with contraction. This finding represents physiological stability and successful uterine involution."
        },
        "f": {
            "content": "Correct. Feeling lightheaded and dizzy upon sitting up are classic symptoms of orthostatic hypotension secondary to hypovolemia. With significant blood loss, the body's ability to compensate for gravitational fluid shifts is impaired. When moving to an upright position, decreased venous return and a reduced circulating volume cause a transient drop in cerebral perfusion, leading to these neurological symptoms."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "Tachycardia vs. Hypotension: The First Responder",
        "content": "A critical trap is waiting for blood pressure to drop before suspecting hemorrhage. Hypotension is a late and ominous sign, indicating the failure of compensatory mechanisms. Tachycardia is the body's first and most sensitive hemodynamic response to volume loss. An increase of >20-30 bpm from baseline is a major red flag. Another pitfall is dismissing a 'golf ball' sized clot; any clot larger than a plum or lemon is a definitive sign, but a golf ball is a critical cue that warrants immediate fundal assessment and massage, as it indicates significant pooled blood from uterine atony."
