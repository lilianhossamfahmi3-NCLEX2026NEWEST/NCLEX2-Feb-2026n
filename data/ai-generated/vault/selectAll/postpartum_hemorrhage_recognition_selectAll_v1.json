Early recognition of risk factors and signs/symptoms is crucial for prompt intervention. \n\n*   **Boggy fundus displaced to the right (Option A):** Indicates uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery), the most common cause of PPH. Displacement is often due to a full bladder, which interferes with uterine contraction.\n*   **Saturating a perineal pad in 15 minutes or less (Option B):** Suggests excessive blood loss and active bleeding, requiring immediate attention.\n*   **Passage of a tissue clot the size of a golf ball (Option C):** Indicates significant blood pooling in the uterus and potential retained placental fragments or uterine atony.\n*   **Heart rate increased from 78 to 112 bpm (Option D):** Tachycardia is an early compensatory mechanism for hypovolemia (decreased blood volume) due to blood loss.\n*   **Reports feeling 'lightheaded' and dizzy when sitting up (Option F):** Suggests orthostatic hypotension, a sign of hypovolemia.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\n*   **Firm, midline fundus at the level of the umbilicus (Option E):** This is a normal finding in the early postpartum period, indicating effective uterine contraction.",

Hypotension is a late and ominous sign, indicating the failure of compensatory mechanisms. Tachycardia is the body's first and most sensitive hemodynamic response to volume loss. An increase of >20-30 bpm from baseline is a major red flag. Another pitfall is dismissing a 'golf ball' sized clot; any clot larger than a plum or lemon is a definitive sign, but a golf ball is a critical cue that warrants immediate fundal assessment and massage, as it indicates significant pooled blood from uterine atony."

The myometrial muscle fibers fail to contract and compress the spiral arterioles at the placental implantation site, disrupting hemostasis. Displacement, often to the right, suggests a distended bladder, preventing uterine contraction. **Pathophysiology:** Uterine atony results from overdistension (multiple gestation, polyhydramnios), prolonged labor, grand multiparity, or use of certain medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate, oxytocin overuse). A full bladder occupies space, preventing the uterus from contracting effectively. **Clinical Pearl:** Always assess bladder distension when encountering a boggy fundus. Catheterization may be necessary.",

This rapid blood loss quickly exceeds the 500 mL (vaginal delivery) or 1000 mL (cesarean) threshold for PPH. **Pathophysiology:** This rate indicates active, ongoing bleeding, likely due to uterine atony, lacerations, or retained placental fragments. The body's compensatory mechanisms may be overwhelmed, leading to hypovolemic shock. **Clinical Pearl:** Quantify blood loss accurately. Weighing pads (1 g = 1 mL) provides a more precise estimate than visual assessment.",

Baroreceptors trigger the sympathetic nervous system, releasing catecholamines that increase heart rate and contractility. This is an attempt to maintain blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor heart rate trends closely. A sustained increase, even within the normal range, can be an early warning sign of PPH.",

        "sbar": "Situation: The client is 4 hours postpartum after a vaginal delivery and is being assessed for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).\nBackground: The client had an uncomplicated pregnancy and labor. She received routine postpartum care, including fundal checks and perineal pad monitoring.\nAssessment: The client's fundus is boggy and displaced to the right. Her heart rate has increased from 78 to 112 bpm. She reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy when sitting up. She is saturating a perineal pad in 15 minutes or less and passed a tissue clot the size of a golf ball. Lochia is rubra. Vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. Last void was at 0800. Current time is 1200.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention for suspected PPH. This includes fundal massage, bladder catheterization, notifying the healthcare provider, establishing IV access, administering uterotonic medications (e.g., oxytocin, misoprostol), and monitoring vital signs closely. Prepare for potential blood transfusion if bleeding continues."
