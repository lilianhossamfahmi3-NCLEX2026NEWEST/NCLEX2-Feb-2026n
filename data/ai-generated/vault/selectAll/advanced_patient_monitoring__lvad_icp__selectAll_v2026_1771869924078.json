ICP monitoring initiated due to altered mental status. The patient's GCS has declined from 14 to 11 over the past 4 hours. History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Current medications include IV milrinone, oral warfarin, and insulin. Recent CT head showed mild cerebral edema. Neurological assessment at 0600 revealed sluggish pupillary response on the right and weakness in the left upper extremity. ICP trending upwards, currently at 22 mmHg. MAP stable at 85 mmHg. UOP decreased over the last 2 hours. Family at bedside is increasingly anxious. Concerns include worsening neurological status despite current interventions. Requesting orders for further ICP management and neurological support. Contacted neurosurgery at 0715. Orders pending. Patient reports a headache rated 7/10. Last pain medication given at 0400. Currently on a 6L nasal cannula. O2 sat 94%."
