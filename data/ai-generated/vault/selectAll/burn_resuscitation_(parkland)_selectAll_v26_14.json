    "correct": "The Parkland formula (4 mL x kg x % TBSA) guides fluid resuscitation in burn patients. Half of the calculated volume is administered in the first 8 hours. For this patient: 4 mL x 70 kg x 40% = 11200 mL. Half of this (5600 mL) over 8 hours equals 700 mL/hr. Hourly urine output monitoring is essential to assess fluid status and guide further fluid administration. Elevating the burned extremity helps reduce edema formation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of crystalloid solution is not typically indicated in burn resuscitation unless there are signs of hypovolemic shock. Targeting a urine output of 15 mL/hr is too low for an adult burn patient; the target is 0.5 mL/kg/hr, or 35 mL/hr. Placing the burned extremity in a dependent position will worsen edema. The calculated infusion rate is 700 mL/hr, not 500 mL/hr.",
