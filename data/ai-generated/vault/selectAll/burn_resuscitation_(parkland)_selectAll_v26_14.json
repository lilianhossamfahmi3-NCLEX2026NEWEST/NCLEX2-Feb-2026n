Using the Parkland formula, and taking into consideration the need for airborne isolation, select the interventions the nurse should anticipate in the first 8 hours of resuscitation to manage his fluid balance, prevent complications, and ensure appropriate infection control measures are in place.",

    "correct": "The Parkland formula dictates 4 mL of crystalloid solution (typically Lactated Ringer's) per kg of body weight per % TBSA burned. Half of this total volume is administered in the first 8 hours from the time of the burn. In this case, 4 mL x 70 kg x 40% = 11200 mL. Half of this, 5600 mL, should be infused over the first 8 hours, equating to 700 mL/hr. Strict I/O monitoring is crucial during burn resuscitation to assess fluid status and guide further fluid administration. Elevating the burned extremity promotes venous return and reduces edema formation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the entire calculated fluid volume over 24 hours is incorrect; half is given in the first 8 hours. Bolus crystalloid administration (2000 mL/hr) could lead to fluid overload and complications. While monitoring urine output is important, targeting 15 mL/hr is too low for adults, especially in burn patients; the target is 0.5 mL/kg/hr, or 35 mL/hr. Placing the extremity in a dependent position will exacerbate edema. The calculated rate is 700ml/hr, not 500ml/hr.",
