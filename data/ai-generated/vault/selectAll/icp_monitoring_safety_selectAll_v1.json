This ensures the zero reference point for the pressure monitoring system is accurately aligned with the cerebral ventricles. According to the principles of hydrostatic pressure, if the transducer is positioned too low, it will create a false high ICP reading; if positioned too high, it will generate a false low ICP reading. Inaccurate data can lead to catastrophic clinical decisions, such as withholding necessary osmotic diuretics for a falsely low ICP or administering them inappropriately for a falsely high reading, thereby altering cerebral perfusion."

            "content": "Clamping the EVD tubing during patient movement is a critical safety measure to prevent sudden, uncontrolled changes in CSF volume. Repositioning alters the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the patient's ventricles and the drainage collection system. If the drain remains open and the patient's head is lowered relative to the drip chamber, a rapid, massive outflow of CSF can occur. This can lead to acute ventricular collapse, tearing of delicate bridging veins causing a subdural hematoma, and potential upward brainstem herniation. Conversely, raising the head could cause CSF or air to reflux into the ventricles, increasing infection risk."

            "content": "This action is contraindicated and life-threatening. The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the intracranial space is a fixed vault with a delicate balance of brain tissue, blood, and CSF. A continuous high-pressure flush, used for arterial lines, would rapidly introduce a large volume of fluid directly into the ventricles. This sudden increase in intracranial volume within a closed system would cause a precipitous spike in ICP, drastically reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP) and leading to global cerebral ischemia. It could also directly trigger fatal transtentorial or uncal herniation."

It creates a direct pathway for microorganisms from the external environment into the sterile ventricular system. Any breach in aseptic technique when manipulating ports, changing drainage bags, or performing site care can introduce pathogens, leading to ventriculitis or meningitis. These CNS infections carry a high risk of permanent neurological deficits, hydrocephalus, or death."

Clear drainage is highly suspicious for a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, indicating the system is no longer closed. A CSF leak creates a portal of entry for infection and disrupts the therapeutic pressure gradient for drainage. Bloody drainage can signify bleeding along the catheter tract or intraventricular hemorrhage. Both findings are critical and require immediate reporting to the neurosurgeon for intervention."

This height, ordered by the provider in cm H2O, creates a specific hydrostatic pressure that the ICP must overcome for CSF to flow out. If the chamber is set lower than prescribed, it will lower the resistance to flow, causing excessive CSF drainage and risking ventricular collapse. If set too high, the ICP required to initiate drainage will be greater than intended, leading to insufficient CSF removal and uncontrolled intracranial hypertension."

Arterial lines require a pressurized flush system to prevent backflow and maintain patency. Applying this concept to an EVD, which accesses the closed, non-distensible cranial vault, is catastrophic. The brain cannot accommodate the rapid fluid volume, leading to immediate herniation. Always differentiate: Arterial line = Pressure bag; EVD = No pressure bag, gravity drainage only."
