    "title": "System Crossover Error",
    "explanation": "A critical error in neurocritical care is applying principles from arterial or central venous lines to an EVD. Arterial lines require a pressurized flush to prevent backflow. Applying this to an EVD, accessing the closed cranial vault, is catastrophic. The brain cannot accommodate the rapid fluid volume, leading to immediate herniation. Differentiate: Arterial line = Pressure bag; EVD = Gravity drainage only."
