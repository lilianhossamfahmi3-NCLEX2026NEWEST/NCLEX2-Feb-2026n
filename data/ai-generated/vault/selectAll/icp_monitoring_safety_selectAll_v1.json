      "optionId": "a",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Leveling the transducer to the tragus (external auditory meatus) is crucial. The tragus approximates the foramen of Monro, the reference point for cerebral pressure. Incorrect leveling yields inaccurate ICP readings. A low transducer falsely elevates ICP, potentially leading to unnecessary interventions like osmotic diuretics, which can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. A high transducer falsely lowers ICP, delaying treatment for intracranial hypertension and risking cerebral ischemia. Clinical Pearl: Re-level the transducer after any patient repositioning to ensure accurate readings."

    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Clamping the EVD during repositioning or transfers prevents rapid CSF drainage due to changes in hydrostatic pressure. Unclamped, lowering the patient's head relative to the drainage system can cause excessive CSF loss, leading to ventricular collapse, subdural hematoma from torn bridging veins, and potential brainstem herniation. Conversely, raising the head can cause CSF or air reflux into the ventricles, increasing infection risk. Clinical Pearl: Always clamp the EVD before moving the patient and unclamp only after stabilization at the prescribed height."

    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "correct": false,
      "content": "A continuous high-pressure flush is contraindicated and dangerous. The Monro-Kellie doctrine dictates a fixed intracranial volume. Introducing a large fluid volume via a pressurized flush rapidly increases ICP, decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP). This can cause global cerebral ischemia and potentially fatal transtentorial or uncal herniation. The EVD system relies on gravity drainage, not pressurized infusion. Clinical Pearl: Never use a pressure bag or continuous flush on an EVD system."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Strict aseptic technique is paramount. The EVD bypasses the body's natural defenses (dura mater, blood-brain barrier), creating a direct pathway for microorganisms to the sterile ventricular system. Breaches in aseptic technique during port manipulation, drainage bag changes, or site care can introduce pathogens, leading to ventriculitis or meningitis. These CNS infections carry a high risk of permanent neurological deficits, hydrocephalus, or death. Clinical Pearl: Treat the EVD system as a sterile field. Use sterile gloves and equipment for all manipulations."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "e",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Assess the EVD insertion site regularly. Clear drainage suggests a CSF leak, indicating a compromised closed system and increased infection risk. Bloody drainage can signify bleeding along the catheter tract or intraventricular hemorrhage. A CSF leak disrupts the therapeutic pressure gradient. Intraventricular hemorrhage can worsen neurological outcomes. Both findings require immediate neurosurgical notification. Clinical Pearl: Document the color, consistency, and amount of drainage at the insertion site every hour."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "f",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "The drip chamber height, prescribed in cm H2O, determines the pressure threshold for CSF drainage. This height creates a hydrostatic pressure that ICP must overcome for CSF to flow. A chamber set too low lowers resistance, causing excessive CSF drainage and risking ventricular collapse. A chamber set too high increases resistance, leading to insufficient CSF removal and uncontrolled intracranial hypertension. Clinical Pearl: Double-check the prescribed height with the provider's orders and adjust the drip chamber accordingly."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "System Crossover Error",
    "explanation": "A critical error in neurocritical care is applying principles from arterial or central venous lines to an EVD. Arterial lines require a pressurized flush to prevent backflow. Applying this to an EVD, accessing the closed cranial vault, is catastrophic. The brain cannot accommodate the rapid fluid volume, leading to immediate herniation. Differentiate: Arterial line = Pressure bag; EVD = Gravity drainage only."
