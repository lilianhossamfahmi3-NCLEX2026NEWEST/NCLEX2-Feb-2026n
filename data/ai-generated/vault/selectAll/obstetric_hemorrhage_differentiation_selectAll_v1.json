            "content": "Correct. In placental abruption, the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall causes bleeding into the decidua basalis. This forms a retroplacental hematoma. The accumulating blood acts as a potent irritant to the myometrial (uterine muscle) nerve fibers, resulting in a sudden onset of severe, sharp, and localized pain."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This is the hallmark sign of placenta previa. In previa, the placenta implants over the cervical os. As the lower uterine segment thins and effaces, placental vessels are torn without irritating the myometrium. This leads to bleeding that is typically painless, and the blood is bright red as it is fresh arterial bleeding with a direct path out of the vagina."

            "optionId": "c",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. A rigid, 'board-like' abdomen (uterine tetany) indicates a severe abruption with significant concealed hemorrhage. Blood extravasates into the myometrial fibers, an event known as a Couvelaire uterus. This widespread infiltration of blood prevents the uterine muscle from relaxing, leading to a state of persistent, tonic contraction."

            "optionId": "d",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The presence of blood within the myometrium acts as a powerful stimulant, increasing uterine irritability. This manifests as uterine tenderness upon palpation and high-frequency, low-amplitude contractions (tachysystole). The uterus fails to relax completely between these contractions, leading to a high resting tone."

            "optionId": "e",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Placental separation directly reduces the surface area available for maternal-fetal gas and nutrient exchange, causing uteroplacental insufficiency. The resultant fetal hypoxia and acidosis are reflected on the fetal heart monitor as non-reassuring patterns, such as late decelerations (indicating insufficient oxygen reserves) or sustained bradycardia (a sign of impending fetal collapse)."

            "optionId": "f",

            "content": "Incorrect. A soft, non-tender uterus is characteristic of placenta previa. The bleeding originates at the cervical os and does not infiltrate the contractile portion of the myometrium. Therefore, the uterine muscle remains relaxed and non-tender, only firming during normal contractions if they are present."

        "title": "The 'Bleeding is Bleeding' Fallacy",
        "content": "The primary trap is failing to differentiate third-trimester bleeding based on its quality and associated uterine findings. Candidates may incorrectly equate any vaginal bleeding with a single pathology. The critical distinction lies in the presence or absence of pain and uterine tone. Painful bleeding with a tender, rigid, or hypertonic uterus points to abruption. Painless bleeding with a soft, non-tender uterus points to previa. Overlooking these differentiating cues leads to incorrect diagnosis and potentially life-threatening interventions, such as performing a vaginal exam in a client with previa."
