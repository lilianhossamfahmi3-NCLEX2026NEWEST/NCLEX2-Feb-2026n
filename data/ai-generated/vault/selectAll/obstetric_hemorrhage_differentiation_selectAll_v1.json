    "title": "The 'Bleeding is Bleeding' Fallacy",
    "content": "The primary trap is failing to differentiate third-trimester bleeding based on its quality and associated uterine findings. Candidates may incorrectly equate any vaginal bleeding with a single pathology. The critical distinction lies in the presence or absence of pain and uterine tone. Painful bleeding with a tender, rigid, or hypertonic uterus points to abruption. Painless bleeding with a soft, non-tender uterus points to previa. Overlooking these differentiating cues leads to incorrect diagnosis and potentially life-threatening interventions, such as performing a vaginal exam in a client with previa."
