        "correct": "Hypovolemic shock, resulting from significant blood loss, is characterized by a cascade of physiological responses aimed at maintaining perfusion to vital organs. However, as blood loss continues, these compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed, leading to decompensation. \n\n(A) **Correct:** Tachycardia (HR > 100 bpm) is an early compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased blood volume. The heart beats faster to circulate the reduced volume more efficiently. \n\n(B) **Correct:** Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in systolic BP > 20 mmHg or diastolic BP > 10 mmHg from lying to sitting) indicates a significant loss of intravascular volume. The body's ability to maintain blood pressure upon positional change is compromised due to reduced preload.\n\n(D) **Correct:** Prolonged capillary refill (>3 seconds) signifies inadequate peripheral perfusion. Blood is being shunted to vital organs, leaving the extremities with reduced blood flow.\n\n(E) **Correct:** Restlessness and confusion are signs of cerebral hypoperfusion. The brain is highly sensitive to oxygen deprivation, and altered mental status indicates a critical reduction in blood flow and oxygen delivery.",
        "incorrect": "(C) Epigastric burning is a symptom related to the *cause* of the GI bleed (e.g., peptic ulcer disease) but not a direct indicator of hypovolemic shock itself. While important for diagnosis and management, it doesn't reflect the immediate hemodynamic instability.\n\n(F) Coffee-ground emesis indicates that bleeding has occurred, but a single episode, without accompanying hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, delayed capillary refill), does not definitively confirm active hypovolemic shock. It's a sign of bleeding, but not necessarily shock.",
