These factors contribute to improved convenience and adherence for patients. However, it's crucial to educate patients about the shorter half-life of DOACs and the importance of strict adherence to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation. Additionally, patients should be aware that Vitamin K is not effective in reversing DOACs, and specific reversal agents are required in cases of severe bleeding.",

Strict medication adherence is more critical with DOACs than with warfarin.",

Explain the reversal agents available for DOACs and when they are used. Emphasize the importance of reporting any signs of bleeding and maintaining regular follow-up appointments."
