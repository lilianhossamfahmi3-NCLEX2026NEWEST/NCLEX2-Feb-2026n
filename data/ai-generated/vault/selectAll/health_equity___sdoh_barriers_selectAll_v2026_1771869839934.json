    "stem": "A 62-year-old patient, Maria Rodriguez, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, presents to the clinic for a routine follow-up. According to the EHR, Maria lives alone and is on a fixed income. During the assessment, Maria expresses difficulty affording both her medications and healthy food options. She states, 'I often have to choose between my insulin and buying groceries. Fresh fruits and vegetables are too expensive, and I end up eating more processed foods because they are cheaper and last longer.' Based on this information and the provided EHR tabs, which of the following interventions are most appropriate to promote health equity and address Maria's social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers? Select all that apply.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Food banks and pantries provide free groceries and food items to individuals and families in need. This directly addresses Maria's food insecurity and provides access to nutritious food options, which is crucial for managing her diabetes."

        "rationale": "Prioritizing insulin at the expense of food can lead to malnutrition and further compromise Maria's health. Insulin is crucial, but adequate nutrition is also essential for overall well-being and effective diabetes management. This is a question trap."

        "id": "D",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "While physical activity is beneficial, it cannot compensate for inadequate nutrition. Addressing Maria's food insecurity is a higher priority, as her ability to manage her diabetes and overall health depends on having access to a balanced diet. This option is a distractor."

        "text": "Connect Maria with a social worker or case manager to explore potential financial assistance programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or Medicare/Medicaid resources.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "A social worker or case manager can help Maria navigate the complex landscape of financial assistance programs and access resources that can alleviate her financial burden. SNAP provides food benefits, while Medicare/Medicaid may cover healthcare costs, freeing up funds for food purchases."

        "text": "Suggest Maria discontinue one of her medications (e.g., hyperlipidemia medication) to save money for food.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Discontinuing medication without consulting a healthcare provider is dangerous and can have serious health consequences. This approach is inappropriate and does not address the root cause of Maria's food insecurity. This is a question trap designed to see if the student understands scope of practice and prioritization."
