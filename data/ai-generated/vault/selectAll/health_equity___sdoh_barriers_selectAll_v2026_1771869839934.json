        "stem": "A 62-year-old patient, Maria Rodriguez, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, presents to the clinic for a routine follow-up. According to the EHR, Maria lives alone and is on a fixed income. During the assessment, Maria expresses difficulty affording both her medications and healthy food options. She states, 'I often have to choose between my insulin and buying groceries. Fresh fruits and vegetables are too expensive, and I end up eating more processed foods because they are cheaper and last longer.' Based on this information and the provided EHR tabs, which of the following interventions are most appropriate to promote health equity and address Maria's social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers? Select all that apply.",

These resources offer access to nutritious food options, which is crucial for managing her diabetes effectively. Food insecurity can lead to poor glycemic control, increased risk of complications, and decreased overall well-being. By providing access to healthy foods, this intervention supports better diabetes management and improves Maria's health outcomes."

While insulin is crucial for managing blood glucose levels, adequate nutrition is also essential for overall well-being and effective diabetes management. Malnutrition can exacerbate the effects of diabetes, leading to complications such as hypoglycemia, weakened immune system, and impaired wound healing. This is a question trap; always consider the holistic needs of the patient."

They can teach Maria how to prepare nutritious meals using inexpensive ingredients, which will promote better blood sugar control. This intervention addresses the root cause of Maria's food insecurity by empowering her with the knowledge and skills to make informed food choices within her budget. Effective dietary management is a cornerstone of diabetes care, and personalized meal planning can significantly improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications."

Addressing Maria's food insecurity is a higher priority, as her ability to manage her diabetes and overall health depends on having access to a balanced diet. Without proper nutrition, increased physical activity may lead to hypoglycemia and further compromise her health. This option is a distractor; always prioritize addressing the most immediate and critical needs of the patient."

SNAP provides food benefits, while Medicare/Medicaid may cover healthcare costs, freeing up funds for food purchases. Addressing the underlying financial barriers to food access is crucial for long-term diabetes management and overall health. These programs can provide a safety net, ensuring that Maria has access to the resources she needs to maintain her health and well-being."

This approach is inappropriate and does not address the root cause of Maria's food insecurity. Discontinuing her hyperlipidemia medication could lead to elevated cholesterol levels, increasing her risk of cardiovascular events. This is a question trap designed to assess the student's understanding of scope of practice and prioritization; never advise a patient to alter their medication regimen without consulting their healthcare provider."

Consult with a registered dietitian to develop a budget-friendly meal plan tailored to her dietary requirements and preferences. Refer her to a local food bank or food pantry for supplemental food assistance. Schedule a follow-up appointment to assess the impact of these interventions on her HbA1c levels and overall well-being. Consider a medication reconciliation to explore cost-effective alternatives if appropriate. Reinforce the importance of adherence to both medication and dietary recommendations.
