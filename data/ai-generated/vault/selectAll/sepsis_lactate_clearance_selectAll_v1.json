    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "A decreasing serum lactate level indicates improved tissue perfusion and oxygenation. In septic shock, elevated lactate levels reflect anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate oxygen delivery. A decrease from 5.4 to 2.1 mmol/L suggests that treatment is improving cellular oxygenation and reducing anaerobic metabolism."

    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Maintaining a stable Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) within the target range (e.g., 65-75 mmHg) without increasing vasopressor doses indicates improved hemodynamic stability. This suggests that the client's vascular tone and cardiac output are responding positively to treatment."

    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Adequate urine output (typically >0.5 mL/kg/hr) is a key indicator of renal perfusion. A urine output of 45 mL/hour suggests that the kidneys are receiving sufficient blood flow and are functioning adequately, reflecting improved overall perfusion."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "A shortened capillary refill time indicates improved peripheral perfusion. In septic shock, capillary refill is often prolonged due to vasoconstriction and decreased cardiac output. A decrease from 5 seconds to 2 seconds suggests that treatment is improving blood flow to the extremities."

    "e": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Increasing lethargy and slow response are signs of worsening neurological function, potentially due to decreased cerebral perfusion or septic encephalopathy. These findings indicate that the client's condition is deteriorating, not improving."

    "f": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "An increasing white blood cell (WBC) count may indicate ongoing infection or inflammation. While leukocytosis is common in sepsis, a rising WBC count during treatment suggests that the infection is not being adequately controlled and the inflammatory response is escalating."
