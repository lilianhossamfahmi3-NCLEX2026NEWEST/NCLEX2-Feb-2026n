      "situation": "0700: RN reporting on Mr. James, a 62-year-old male admitted for elevated ICP. He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and a HeartMate III LVAD implanted 6 months ago. Recent head trauma from a fall at home initiated this admission. GCS is currently 11.",
      "background": "Patient has been on continuous ICP monitoring since admission. Initial ICP was 22 mmHg. He is on a nicardipine drip to maintain SBP between 100-120 mmHg. LVAD parameters are: Flow 5.2 LPM, Speed 9200 RPM, PI 6. The LVAD is set to full support. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated; current settings are FiO2 40%, TV 500 mL, RR 16.",
      "assessment": "0645: ICP is now 28 mmHg despite current interventions. Neuro assessment reveals sluggish pupillary response on the right. No motor response to pain on the left side. Vitals: HR 88 bpm, MAP 85 mmHg, CVP 14 mmHg, SpO2 96%. Intermittent bubbling noted in the chest tube. EKG shows NSR.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend immediate neurosurgical consult for possible hematoma or further intervention to reduce ICP. Consider mannitol or hypertonic saline administration per protocol. Also, assess for potential pneumothorax given the chest tube bubbling. Please evaluate the patient ASAP."
