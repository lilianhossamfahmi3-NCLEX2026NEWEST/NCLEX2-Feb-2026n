The admitting nurse is reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR) to identify potential social determinants of health (SDOH) that may impact Mr. Jones's care and recovery. Based on the information available in the EHR, which of the following factors should the nurse consider as potential SDOH barriers affecting Mr. Jones's health outcomes? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Limited access to transportation and living in a rural area can significantly impact Mr. Jones's ability to attend follow-up appointments, access healthcare services, and obtain necessary medications or resources. This creates a barrier to optimal health management and exacerbates existing health conditions."

        "rationale": "While education and occupation are components of SDOH, having a high school diploma suggests a certain level of educational attainment, and previous employment indicates a work history. This information alone does not automatically present a barrier to health outcomes; more context is needed to determine its impact."

        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Experiencing discrimination in healthcare settings can create distrust, deter patients from seeking necessary care, and negatively impact health outcomes. Racial discrimination is a significant SDOH barrier and contributes to health inequities."
