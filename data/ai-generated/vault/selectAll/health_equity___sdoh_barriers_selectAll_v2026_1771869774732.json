The admitting nurse is reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR) to identify potential social determinants of health (SDOH) that may impact Mr. Jones's care and recovery. Based on the information available in the EHR, which of the following factors should the nurse consider as potential SDOH barriers affecting Mr. Jones's health outcomes? Select all that apply.",

Patients may struggle to attend appointments, access pharmacies, or participate in community-based programs. This isolation can exacerbate existing health conditions and hinder effective management of chronic illnesses like heart failure. Limited transportation options directly impact the patient's ability to maintain their health and well-being."

For example, the physical demands of construction work could have contributed to his current condition, but this is not explicitly stated."

It can lead to distrust of the healthcare system, reluctance to seek care, and poorer health outcomes. Racial discrimination can affect the quality of care received, adherence to treatment plans, and overall patient satisfaction. Addressing discrimination is crucial for promoting health equity and ensuring all patients receive respectful and appropriate care. This directly impacts his willingness to engage with the healthcare system."

This is a positive factor that supports better health outcomes. Having adequate insurance coverage allows patients to seek timely medical attention and adhere to prescribed treatments without the burden of high costs. Therefore, it is not considered a negative SDOH factor."

Limited availability of fresh fruits and vegetables can result in inadequate intake of essential nutrients, exacerbating existing health problems. This lack of access is a significant SDOH barrier affecting health outcomes and overall well-being. Poor nutrition directly impacts his ability to manage his heart failure."

Strong social networks are protective factors, and their absence represents an SDOH barrier. Social support provides emotional, practical, and informational resources that help individuals cope with health challenges and maintain their well-being. This isolation can worsen his heart failure symptoms and overall quality of life."

A consult with social work is needed to evaluate transportation needs, food security, and social support. Implement culturally sensitive care to address potential distrust due to perceived discrimination. Initiate a heart failure management protocol, including medication administration, oxygen therapy, and fluid restriction. Monitor vital signs and lab values closely."

The focus should be on identifying factors that directly impede access to care, resources, or support, such as transportation, discrimination, food access, and social support. Overlooking these barriers can result in a fragmented approach to care and perpetuate health inequities."
