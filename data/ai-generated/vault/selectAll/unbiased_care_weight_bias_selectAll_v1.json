Using an undersized blood pressure cuff can lead to falsely elevated readings. The cuff's bladder must encircle at least 80% of the arm. An undersized cuff requires excessive pressure to occlude the brachial artery, leading to an artificially high systolic and diastolic reading. This can result in misdiagnosis of hypertension and unnecessary medication administration. This action promotes patient comfort and accurate assessment. **Clinical Pearl:** Keep a variety of cuff sizes readily available and select the appropriate size based on arm circumference, not perceived size.",

    "content": "The primary trap in this scenario is 'diagnostic overshadowing,' a cognitive error where a client's prominent characteristic, such as a higher BMI, is incorrectly assumed to be the cause of all their health problems. This leads the clinician to prematurely halt their diagnostic process. For example, attributing new-onset dyspnea to weight without ruling out a pulmonary embolism can be a fatal error. NGN 2026 standards require nurses to actively combat this bias by ensuring every symptom is investigated with a full differential diagnosis, regardless of the client's body size, to prevent missed diagnoses and ensure equitable care."
