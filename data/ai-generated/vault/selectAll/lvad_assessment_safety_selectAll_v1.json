        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "The LVAD is a continuous-flow rotary pump. An internal impeller spins at thousands of RPMs to propel blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. This constant mechanical motion generates a characteristic 'hum' or 'whir,' which is the primary auscultatory sign of normal device function. The absence of this sound signifies pump failure (e.g., thrombosis, power loss) and is a medical emergency."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "The continuous, non-pulsatile flow generated by the LVAD eliminates the normal systolic and diastolic pressure waves required to produce Korotkoff sounds. A Doppler ultrasound is used to detect the return of arterial blood flow as the cuff is deflated; this first sound reflects the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), the average pressure driving organ perfusion. The target MAP is typically 70-90 mmHg to ensure adequate perfusion without causing right ventricular strain from excessive afterload."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "The continuous flow from the LVAD dampens or eliminates the pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures), resulting in a weak, thready, or completely non-palpable peripheral pulse. A strong, bounding pulse is an atypical finding and may indicate either significant native ventricular recovery or a pump malfunction (e.g., low pump speed, partial thrombosis) that is allowing excessive pulsatile flow, requiring further investigation."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "The percutaneous driveline creates a permanent breach in the integumentary system, providing a direct portal for microbial invasion. Local signs of inflammation (erythema, warmth, purulent drainage) indicate a driveline exit site infection (DLSI). If untreated, the infection can track along the driveline into the preperitoneal space or mediastinum, leading to life-threatening systemic infection and sepsis."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "The external controller and batteries are electronic components that are not waterproof. Submersion in water will cause an immediate short circuit, leading to complete and catastrophic power failure of the LVAD system. The pump will cease to function, resulting in an abrupt cessation of circulatory support, leading to profound cardiogenic shock and death within minutes if power is not immediately restored."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "The LVAD is a life-sustaining device entirely dependent on an external power source. Battery depletion or unexpected component failure will cause the pump to stop, leading to immediate hemodynamic collapse. Having fully charged spare batteries and a backup system controller is a mandatory, non-negotiable safety protocol to ensure continuous circulatory support can be maintained in the event of equipment failure."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is the misapplication of traditional cardiac assessment techniques to the unique hemodynamics of an LVAD. Candidates may incorrectly flag the absence of a palpable pulse or a standard blood pressure reading as a sign of cardiac arrest, when it is an expected finding due to the device's continuous, non-pulsatile flow.",
    "mnemonics": "For LVAD care, remember to 'PACK your MAP and DRIVE to the HUM.' PACK: Always have a backup PACK (batteries, controller). MAP: Monitor Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) with a doppler. DRIVE: Assess the DRIVE-line for infection. HUM: Auscultate for the continuous HUM of the pump."
