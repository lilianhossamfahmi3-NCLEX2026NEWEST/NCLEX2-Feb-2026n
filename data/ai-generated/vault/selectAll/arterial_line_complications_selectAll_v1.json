    "a": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is a correct and expected finding. The pressure bag must be inflated to 300 mmHg to maintain line patency and prevent blood backflow.",
      "rationale": "Maintaining the pressure bag at 300 mmHg ensures a continuous, slow infusion (approximately 3 mL/hr) of flush solution, preventing blood from backing up into the catheter and causing thrombus formation. This pressure gradient, exceeding the client's systolic arterial pressure, is crucial for accurate and continuous monitoring.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always verify the pressure bag is inflated to 300 mmHg after insertion and during routine arterial line checks. A drop in pressure can indicate a leak or system malfunction."

      "correct": true,
      "content": "This is a critical finding indicating potential limb ischemia. The nurse should immediately assess circulation and notify the provider.",
      "rationale": "Pallor and coolness of the hand suggest compromised arterial blood flow distal to the arterial line insertion site. The arterial catheter can cause vasospasm or thrombus formation, leading to reduced oxygen delivery and tissue ischemia. Prolonged ischemia can result in irreversible tissue damage.",

      "rationale": "A flat-line waveform indicates a complete loss of arterial pressure reading. This can be caused by catheter occlusion (thrombus), disconnection, kinked tubing, or transducer failure. The most life-threatening cause is catheter-tubing disconnection, leading to rapid exsanguination.",

      "rationale": "Blood in the pressure tubing indicates that the pressure in the flush system is lower than the client's arterial pressure, allowing blood to backflow into the tubing. This can be caused by insufficient pressure in the bag (<300 mmHg) or a leak in the system. Blood in the tubing increases the risk of clot formation and subsequent catheter occlusion or distal embolization.",

      "rationale": "A capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds indicates impaired arterial blood flow to the microvasculature of the digit. A capillary refill of 5 seconds is significantly prolonged and suggests potential radial artery occlusion or spasm from the catheter, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues.",
