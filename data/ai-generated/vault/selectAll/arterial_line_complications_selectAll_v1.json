        "a": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is a correct and expected finding. The pressurized flush system must be inflated to 300 mmHg to create a pressure gradient that exceeds the client's systolic arterial pressure. This counter-pressure prevents blood from backing up into the non-distensible tubing, which would lead to thrombus formation and catheter occlusion. It also ensures a continuous, slow infusion (approx. 3 mL/hr) to maintain line patency."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a critical finding indicating limb ischemia. The presence of the intra-arterial catheter can induce vasospasm or serve as a nidus for thrombus formation, leading to partial or complete occlusion of the radial artery. The resultant decrease in arterial blood flow compromises tissue perfusion distal to the site, causing vasoconstriction and reduced oxygen delivery, which manifests as pallor (paleness) and poikilothermia (coolness)."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding signals a complete failure of pressure transmission and is a critical safety alert. The most life-threatening cause is catheter-tubing disconnection, which creates an open conduit from a major artery, posing an immediate risk of rapid exsanguination. Other causes include a fully occluded catheter (thrombus), kinked tubing, or transducer failure. The immediate priority is to assess the client and insertion site for hemorrhage."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is the correct procedural standard for obtaining accurate hemodynamic measurements. The phlebostatic axis (fourth intercostal space, mid-axillary line) approximates the level of the right atrium. Based on the principles of hydrostatics, leveling the transducer's air-fluid interface here negates the influence of gravitational forces on the fluid column, ensuring the displayed pressure accurately reflects the client's intravascular pressure without artifact."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This indicates a failure in the pressure-flush system. Blood will only flow retrograde into the tubing if the client's arterial pressure is greater than the pressure exerted by the flush system. This is typically caused by insufficient pressure in the bag (<300 mmHg) or a leak in the system. This backflow promotes clot formation within the line, risking catheter occlusion or distal embolization upon flushing."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a quantitative sign of compromised distal perfusion. A capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds (5 seconds is significantly prolonged) indicates sluggish arterial inflow to the microvasculature of the digit. This objective finding directly reflects impaired tissue perfusion secondary to potential radial artery occlusion or spasm from the catheter and is a key indicator of developing limb ischemia."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "This question requires differentiating between routine, correct arterial line management and signs of acute complications. Options 'a' and 'd' describe the correct setup (pressure bag at 300 mmHg) and leveling (phlebostatic axis). Candidates who are not confident in these specific standards may incorrectly identify them as problems. The key is to focus on findings that reflect a pathophysiological deviation or an immediate safety risk to the client, such as circulatory compromise or equipment failure.",
    "mnemonics": "For arterial line complications, remember the '6 P's' for ischemia and 'DISH' for system failure:\n\n'6 P's of Limb Ischemia':\n- Pain\n- Pallor\n- Pulselessness\n- Paresthesia\n- Paralysis\n- Poikilothermia (coolness)\n\n'DISH' for System Failure:\n- Disconnection (hemorrhage risk)\n- Insufficient pressure (blood backup)\n- Signal loss (flat-line/dampened waveform)\n- Hematoma/Hemorrhage at site"
