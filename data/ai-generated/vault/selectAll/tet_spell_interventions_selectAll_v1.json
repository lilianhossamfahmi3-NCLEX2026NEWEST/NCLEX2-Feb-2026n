A calm environment minimizes stimuli, reduces anxiety, and decreases metabolic oxygen demand, preventing escalation of the spell. This supports the effectiveness of other interventions by reducing the infant's oxygen consumption and agitation.",

Agitation stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, releasing catecholamines that worsen infundibular spasm and increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), intensifying right-to-left shunting and cyanosis. This intervention would exacerbate the infant's condition.",

      "content": "Placing the infant in the knee-chest position is a priority intervention. This position flexes the hips and knees, kinking the femoral and popliteal arteries, which mechanically increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Elevated SVR raises pressure in the left ventricle and aorta, opposing right-to-left shunting across the ventricular septal defect (VSD). More blood is directed to the pulmonary artery for oxygenation, improving arterial oxygen saturation and relieving cyanosis.",

Morphine's sedative properties reduce anxiety and agitation, decreasing circulating catecholamines and lowering oxygen consumption. Morphine may also directly relax the hypertrophied infundibular muscle of the right ventricular outflow tract, alleviating obstruction and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, breaking the hypercyanotic spell cycle.",

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is misinterpreting the cyanosis and respiratory distress as a primary respiratory obstruction or cardiac arrest. This leads to selecting incorrect interventions like chest physiotherapy (worsens the spell) or chest compressions (only for pulselessness). Recognize the hemodynamic cause: increased right-to-left shunting, requiring interventions that increase SVR and decrease PVR.",
  "mnemonics": "To remember the priority interventions for a Tet spell, use the mnemonic **'KNEE'**: **K**nee-chest position (increases SVR), **N**arcotic (Morphine IV to relax spasm and sedate), **E**nvironment (calm to decrease agitation), **E**nhance Oxygen (100% O2 to decrease PVR).",

    "recommendation": "0801: Initiate interventions to increase SVR and decrease PVR immediately: Place the infant in the knee-chest position, administer 100% oxygen via blow-by, provide a calm and quiet environment, and administer IV morphine 0.1 mg/kg as prescribed. Continuously monitor vital signs (HR, RR, SpO2) and response to interventions. If the spell does not resolve within 5 minutes, be prepared to escalate care, including contacting the physician for further orders and potential transfer to the ICU. Consider a fluid bolus if no improvement is noted after initial interventions. Prepare for potential administration of phenylephrine if morphine is ineffective."
