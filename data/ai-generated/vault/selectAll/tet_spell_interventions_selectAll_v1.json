            "content": "This is a foundational nursing action that should be implemented concurrently with other measures. The onset of a Tet spell is often triggered by stressors like crying, pain, or fear. These events increase sympathetic tone, which can precipitate or worsen infundibular spasm. By providing a calm, quiet environment and using soothing techniques, the nurse minimizes noxious stimuli, reduces the infant's anxiety, and decreases the metabolic oxygen demand. This helps to prevent the spell from escalating and supports the effectiveness of other interventions."

            "content": "This action is contraindicated and harmful during a Tet spell. Vigorous chest physiotherapy is highly agitating for an infant. The resulting crying and distress would increase the infant's metabolic rate and oxygen demand. More critically, agitation stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, releasing catecholamines that can worsen the dynamic spasm of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) and increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), thereby intensifying the right-to-left shunt and deepening the cyanosis."

            "content": "This is a priority intervention. Placing the infant in a knee-chest (or squatting) position flexes the hips and knees, which kinks the femoral and popliteal arteries. This action mechanically increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The elevated SVR raises the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta, creating a pressure gradient that opposes the right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood across the ventricular septal defect (VSD). As a result, more blood is directed from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery for oxygenation, improving arterial oxygen saturation and relieving cyanosis."

            "content": "Administering 100% oxygen is a key intervention. Hypoxemia itself is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor. By providing supplemental oxygen, the nurse helps to reverse this effect. Oxygen acts as a direct pulmonary vasodilator, which decreases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A lower PVR makes it easier for the right ventricle to pump blood into the pulmonary circulation, thereby reducing the amount of deoxygenated blood shunting from right-to-left across the VSD and improving systemic oxygenation."

A Tet spell is a state of profound hypoxemia due to intracardiac shunting, not a loss of cardiac output. The infant will have a pulse, which is often rapid. Initiating chest compressions on a perfusing heart is not indicated, can cause injury (e.g., rib fractures, myocardial contusion), and critically delays the specific interventions (knee-chest, O2, morphine) required to correct the underlying pathophysiology of the spell."

            "content": "Administering IV morphine sulfate is a critical pharmacological intervention. Morphine has two primary mechanisms of action in this context. First, its potent sedative properties reduce anxiety and agitation, which decreases circulating catecholamines and lowers the infant's overall oxygen consumption. Second, morphine is believed to have a direct relaxing effect on the hypertrophied infundibular muscle of the right ventricular outflow tract, alleviating the dynamic obstruction and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. This helps to break the cycle of the hypercyanotic spell."

    ],
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is misinterpreting the profound cyanosis and respiratory distress of a Tet spell as either a primary respiratory obstruction or a pulseless cardiac arrest. This leads to selecting incorrect interventions like vigorous chest physiotherapy (which worsens the spell by increasing agitation and PVR) or chest compressions (which are only for pulselessness). The key is to recognize the unique hemodynamic cause: a sudden increase in right-to-left shunting, requiring interventions that increase SVR and decrease PVR.",
    "mnemonics": "To remember the priority interventions for a Tet spell, use the mnemonic **'KNEE'**: **K**nee-chest position (increases SVR), **N**arcotic (Morphine IV to relax spasm and sedate), **E**nvironment (calm to decrease agitation), **E**nhance Oxygen (100% O2 to decrease PVR).",
