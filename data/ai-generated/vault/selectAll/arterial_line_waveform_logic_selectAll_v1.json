            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is a classic visual sign of an overdamped system. The damping effect filters out the high-frequency components of the arterial pressure wave. This loss of fidelity smooths the sharp systolic upstroke and blunts the peak, leading to a falsely low systolic reading. The dicrotic notch, a high-frequency event caused by the abrupt closure of the aortic valve, is also lost, resulting in a featureless, rounded waveform."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Multiple oscillations or 'ringing' after a square-wave flush test are the hallmark of an *underdamped* system. The system has excessive resonance and minimal resistance, causing the pressure signal to overshoot and oscillate before settling. This artifactually amplifies the systolic peak, resulting in a falsely *high* systolic blood pressure reading."

        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is a direct physical cause of overdamping. Air is highly compressible, unlike the saline in the tubing. When the arterial pressure wave travels through the fluid, the air bubble compresses and expands, absorbing the kinetic energy of the pulse. This 'cushioning' effect effectively dampens the signal before it reaches the transducer, resulting in a blunted waveform and an inaccurately low systolic reading."

        "d": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is a mechanical cause of overdamping. A kink in the catheter creates a point of high resistance, partially obstructing the fluid column. Based on fluid dynamics, this obstruction dissipates the energy of the pressure wave as it attempts to pass through the narrowed lumen. The transducer receives a pressure signal with reduced amplitude, which is interpreted as a falsely low systolic pressure."

        "e": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "A narrow, 'spiky' waveform with an exaggerated dicrotic notch indicates an *underdamped* system. The low resistance in the system allows for excessive resonance, which amplifies the high-frequency components of the waveform. This creates an artificially sharp and narrow systolic peak ('whip' or 'spike') and overemphasizes the dicrotic notch, leading to a falsely elevated systolic reading."
        },
        "f": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is a pathological cause of overdamping. A thrombus at the catheter tip creates a physical obstruction that impedes the transmission of the pressure wave from the patient's artery into the fluid-filled tubing. The clot absorbs and scatters the pulse energy, directly dampening the signal. This results in a slurred waveform and an erroneously low systolic pressure reading, while also posing a significant risk for catheter occlusion and embolization."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the characteristics and causes of overdamping versus underdamping. Both lead to inaccurate readings but in opposite directions. Overdamping results from factors that absorb or obstruct the pressure wave (air, clots, kinks), causing blunted waveforms and falsely low systolic pressures. Underdamping results from excessive resonance (long tubing, stiff tubing), causing spiky waveforms and falsely high systolic pressures.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the 'O' and 'U' to differentiate: **O**verdamped is **O**bstructed or **O**bliterated, leading to artificially **L**ow systolic readings. **U**nderdamped is **U**ncontrolled and shoots **U**pward, leading to artificially **H**igh systolic readings."
