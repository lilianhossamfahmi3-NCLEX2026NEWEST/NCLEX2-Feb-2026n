    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Sudden onset of loss of balance or dizziness (ataxia/vertigo) indicates potential ischemia affecting the cerebellum or brainstem, structures crucial for coordination and equilibrium. This aligns with the 'B' in BE-FAST. Immediate activation of the stroke protocol is warranted."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "New blurry vision or loss of vision in one eye suggests possible ischemia in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) or ophthalmic artery, potentially affecting the occipital lobe or retina. This aligns with the 'E' in BE-FAST. Immediate activation of the stroke protocol is warranted."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Uneven facial expression when asked to smile (facial droop) is a classic sign of stroke resulting from ischemia to the motor cortex, typically in the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory. This aligns with the 'F' in BE-FAST. Immediate activation of the stroke protocol is warranted."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Intermittent numbness in the fingertips after typing for 2 hours is more indicative of peripheral nerve entrapment (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome) than acute stroke. Stroke symptoms are characterized by sudden onset, not gradual development related to specific activities. This does NOT warrant immediate activation of the stroke protocol."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Inability to hold one arm up at the same height as the other (pronator drift) is a sensitive indicator of unilateral motor weakness (hemiparesis), suggesting ischemia in the MCA territory affecting the motor cortex. This aligns with the 'A' in BE-FAST. Immediate activation of the stroke protocol is warranted."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Developing 'slurred' speech (dysarthria) or responding with 'word salad' (aphasia) indicates potential ischemia in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (usually left), supplied by the MCA. This aligns with the 'S' in BE-FAST. Immediate activation of the stroke protocol is warranted."
    }
  },
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between central (stroke) and peripheral (nerve compression) neurological signs. The critical differentiating factor is the onset. Stroke symptoms are characteristically *sudden* and maximal at onset, reflecting an acute vascular event. Symptoms that are gradual, intermittent, or clearly linked to a mechanical stressor (like typing) suggest a localized, non-vascular cause.",
  "mnemonics": "BE-FAST for Stroke Recognition: **B**alance (loss of), **E**yes (vision changes), **F**ace (drooping), **A**rms (weakness), **S**peech (difficulty), **T**ime (to call 911 immediately). This updated mnemonic is superior to the older 'FAST' as it incorporates symptoms of posterior circulation strokes (Balance and Eyes), which are often missed by the original acronym, thereby increasing diagnostic sensitivity.",

    "situation": "The triage nurse is evaluating a client presenting with potential stroke symptoms.",

    "assessment": "The client exhibits [list abnormal findings from options a, b, c, e, and f]. These findings are indicative of a possible acute stroke. Time of onset is critical.",
    "recommendation": "STAT neurological consult and immediate transfer for CT imaging to rule out hemorrhage. Initiate stroke protocol including NPO status, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and frequent neurological assessments. Obtain a detailed history including medications and past medical history. Notify the stroke team immediately at [hospital phone number] using military time (e.g., 1400 hours)."

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The BE-FAST mnemonic (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech, Time) is used to identify potential stroke symptoms. Sudden onset of balance issues, vision changes, facial drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulties warrant immediate activation of the stroke protocol. Option D is incorrect as it describes a gradual onset of symptoms related to a specific activity, more indicative of a peripheral nerve issue."
