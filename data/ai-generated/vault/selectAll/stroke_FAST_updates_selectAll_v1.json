        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding corresponds to 'B' for Balance in the BE-FAST mnemonic. Acute ataxia (loss of balance) or vertigo (dizziness) indicates ischemia affecting the cerebellum or brainstem. These structures, primarily supplied by the posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar arteries), are critical for coordinating movement and maintaining equilibrium. A sudden disruption of blood flow causes an immediate functional deficit."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding corresponds to 'E' for Eyes. Sudden vision changes are a key sign of stroke. Ischemia in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) can damage the occipital lobe, causing contralateral homonymous hemianopia. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) affecting the ophthalmic artery can cause amaurosis fugax, a temporary, painless loss of vision in one eye, often described as a 'curtain' descending."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding corresponds to 'F' for Face. Facial droop is a classic sign of stroke resulting from ischemia to the motor cortex, typically in the territory of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). This causes an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the contralateral lower face, as innervation to the upper face is bilateral. When the client smiles, the affected side of the mouth will not move upwards, creating asymmetry."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This symptom's characteristics—intermittent onset related to a specific, repetitive activity—point towards a peripheral nerve entrapment, such as carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression). Stroke symptoms are defined by their sudden, acute onset, reflecting an abrupt vascular occlusion. This client's presentation lacks the suddenness characteristic of a central nervous system ischemic event."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding corresponds to 'A' for Arms. The inability to hold one arm up, known as pronator drift, is a sensitive indicator of unilateral motor weakness (hemiparesis). Ischemia in the MCA territory affecting the precentral gyrus (motor cortex) disrupts corticospinal tract signals. This results in the arm on the contralateral side pronating and drifting downward when held out, as antigravity muscles are weakened."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This finding corresponds to 'S' for Speech. Speech disturbances arise from ischemia in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (usually left), supplied by the MCA. 'Slurred speech' (dysarthria) results from impaired motor control of the muscles for speech. 'Word salad' (Wernicke's or receptive aphasia) indicates damage to the temporal lobe, causing fluent but nonsensical speech and an inability to comprehend language."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between central (stroke) and peripheral (nerve compression) neurological signs. The critical differentiating factor is the onset. Stroke symptoms are characteristically *sudden* and maximal at onset, reflecting an acute vascular event. Symptoms that are gradual, intermittent, or clearly linked to a mechanical stressor (like typing) suggest a localized, non-vascular cause.",
    "mnemonics": "BE-FAST for Stroke Recognition: **B**alance (loss of), **E**yes (vision changes), **F**ace (drooping), **A**rms (weakness), **S**peech (difficulty), **T**ime (to call 911 immediately). This updated mnemonic is superior to the older 'FAST' as it incorporates symptoms of posterior circulation strokes (Balance and Eyes), which are often missed by the original acronym, thereby increasing diagnostic sensitivity."
