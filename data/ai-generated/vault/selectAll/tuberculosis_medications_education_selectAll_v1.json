            "content": "This is correct. Isoniazid, Rifampin, and Pyrazinamide are all hepatotoxic. Their metabolites (e.g., acetylhydrazine from Isoniazid) can cause direct hepatocellular injury. This damage impairs the liver's ability to conjugate and excrete bilirubin, leading to hyperbilirubinemia. The clinical sign of this is jaundice (icterus), a high-priority finding that indicates significant liver dysfunction and requires immediate medical evaluation to prevent progression to fulminant hepatic failure."

The drug and its metabolites impart a harmless but distinct reddish-orange color to urine, sweat, tears, and saliva. Educating the client about this expected side effect is crucial to prevent anxiety and non-adherence. The nurse should also advise that soft contact lenses can be permanently stained."

            "content": "This is correct. Ethambutol can cause a dose-dependent optic neuritis. The proposed mechanism involves chelation of essential metal ions (copper, zinc) in the retinal ganglion cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and optic nerve demyelination. The earliest signs are decreased visual acuity and impaired red-green color discrimination. This is a medical emergency, as the damage can be irreversible if the medication is not stopped promptly."

            "content": "This is incorrect. Premature cessation of therapy is a primary cause of treatment failure and the development of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). While sputum cultures may become negative and symptoms may resolve, slow-growing or dormant bacilli (persisters) can remain. Completing the entire prescribed course (typically 6 months or longer) is essential to eradicate all mycobacteria and prevent a relapse with a more virulent, resistant strain."

            "content": "This is correct. Alcohol (ethanol) and the anti-TB medications are both metabolized by the liver, primarily through the cytochrome P450 system. Concurrent use creates a synergistic effect, overwhelming the liver's metabolic capacity and increasing the production of toxic byproducts. This significantly elevates the risk of severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and acute liver failure. Absolute abstinence from alcohol during the entire treatment course is a critical safety measure."

            "content": "This is correct. Isoniazid (INH) is structurally similar to pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) and acts as an antagonist, inhibiting the enzyme that converts B6 to its active form. This active form is a vital coenzyme for neurotransmitter synthesis and myelin sheath integrity in the peripheral nerves. Depletion leads to a symmetrical, 'stocking-glove' peripheral neuropathy. Prophylactic supplementation with pyridoxine prevents this neurotoxicity without affecting the bactericidal action of INH."

        "content": "The most significant pitfall in TB management is non-adherence driven by the client feeling better after a few weeks of therapy. Negative sputum cultures can reinforce this false sense of security. Nurses must emphatically teach that symptomatic improvement does not equal bacteriological cure. The long duration of therapy is specifically designed to eliminate the semi-dormant 'persister' bacilli that cause relapse and drug resistance if not fully eradicated."
