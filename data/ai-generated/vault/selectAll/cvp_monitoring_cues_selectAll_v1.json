Elevated CVP reflects increased right atrial pressure due to increased blood volume. An S3 heart sound is associated with rapid ventricular filling and can indicate ventricular dysfunction due to fluid overload. JVD at 45 degrees signifies increased central venous pressure. Bilateral crackles suggest pulmonary edema, a consequence of fluid accumulation in the lungs.",

Test-takers may correctly associate high CVP and JVD with right-sided fluid overload but incorrectly dismiss bilateral crackles as a 'left-sided only' problem. In systemic hypervolemia, the entire system is overloaded; the right-sided pressure (CVP) rises, and the subsequent failure of the left ventricle to manage the volume causes pulmonary backup (crackles). Both sets of signs can coexist and point to the same underlying problem of fluid excess. Remember to consider the whole clinical picture."
