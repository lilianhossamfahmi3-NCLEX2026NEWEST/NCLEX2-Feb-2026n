            "content": "This is a correct finding that requires immediate follow-up. The triad of redness, warmth, and localized tenderness are classic signs of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The postpartum period, particularly after a cesarean section, creates a hypercoagulable state due to elevated clotting factors (e.g., fibrinogen). Venous stasis from immobility during and after surgery, combined with potential endothelial injury to pelvic vessels during the procedure (Virchow's triad), significantly elevates DVT risk. An untreated DVT can lead to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs."

            "content": "This is a correct finding that requires immediate intervention. Foul-smelling (malodorous) lochia combined with maternal tachycardia are hallmark signs of endometritis, an infection of the uterine lining. The uterine cavity post-delivery is a raw surface susceptible to ascending polymicrobial infection from the lower genital tract. The C-section provides an additional portal of entry. Bacterial endotoxins trigger a systemic inflammatory response, leading to fever and tachycardia (a compensatory mechanism for increased metabolic demand and vasodilation). This condition requires prompt antibiotic therapy to prevent sepsis."

            "content": "This is a correct finding that requires immediate intervention. A persistent headache, especially when accompanied by visual disturbances like blurred vision or scotomata (seeing spots), is a cardinal sign of postpartum preeclampsia. This condition results from persistent endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm. Cerebral vasospasm reduces blood flow to the brain, causing headaches, while retinal arteriolar spasm causes the visual changes. These symptoms indicate central nervous system irritability and signal an imminent risk of an eclamptic seizure, which is a neurological emergency."

            "content": "This is an incorrect finding; it represents a normal physiological process. Lochia, the postpartum uterine discharge, can pool in the posterior vaginal fornix while the client is recumbent. When the client stands, the force of gravity causes the pooled lochia to be expelled in a 'gush'. This is expected and differs from postpartum hemorrhage, which would be characterized by a continuous heavy flow, saturating more than one peripad per hour, and often accompanied by signs of hemodynamic instability."

            "content": "This is a correct finding that requires further investigation. Dysuria (burning on urination) and urinary urgency are classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically cystitis. Clients who have undergone a cesarean delivery typically have an indwelling urinary catheter placed, which is a primary risk factor for UTIs as it provides a direct pathway for bacteria (commonly *E. coli*) to ascend into the bladder. Postpartum bladder atony can also lead to urinary retention and stasis, further promoting bacterial growth. An untreated UTI can ascend to the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis."

The minimum acceptable urine output is 30 mL/hour. During pregnancy, total body water increases significantly. In the first 2-5 days postpartum, the body rapidly eliminates this excess fluid through diuresis (increased urination) and diaphoresis (sweating). This output is a reassuring sign of adequate renal function and appropriate fluid shifting."

        "title": "Normal vs. Pathological Postpartum Changes",
        "content": "A common cognitive error is failing to differentiate expected physiological postpartum changes from signs of life-threatening complications. The 'gush' of lochia upon standing (Option D) and significant urine output (Option F) are normal and reassuring. Candidates may incorrectly flag these as problems. Conversely, subtle signs like a headache (Option C) might be dismissed as benign when, in the context of the postpartum period, it is a critical indicator of potential preeclampsia. The key is to contextualize every finding within the specific risks of the postpartum period: hemorrhage, infection, thrombosis, and hypertensive disorders."
