      "optionId": "a",
      "content": "This is a correct finding (+). Redness, warmth, and localized tenderness on the left calf suggest a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Postpartum, especially after cesarean, hypercoagulability occurs due to increased clotting factors. Immobility and potential vascular damage during surgery (Virchow's triad) increase DVT risk. Untreated DVT can cause pulmonary embolism (PE). ClinicalPearl: Assess calf circumference bilaterally to quantify swelling. SBAR: 0900: Pt c/o left calf pain, redness, warmth. Possible DVT. Vitals stable. Request Doppler ultrasound STAT.",
      "rationale": "The postpartum period induces a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thrombus formation. Cesarean sections further elevate this risk due to surgical trauma and prolonged immobility. The classic signs of DVT are due to inflammation and obstruction of venous return."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "content": "This is a correct finding (+). Foul-smelling lochia with maternal tachycardia indicates endometritis, a uterine lining infection. Post-delivery, the uterine cavity is susceptible to ascending polymicrobial infection. C-section increases this risk. Bacterial endotoxins cause systemic inflammation, leading to fever and tachycardia. Prompt antibiotics are needed to prevent sepsis. ClinicalPearl: Assess fundal tenderness; severe pain suggests endometritis. SBAR: 0900: Pt with foul-smelling lochia and HR 110 bpm. Temp 38.5°C. Possible endometritis. Request order for CBC, blood cultures, and antibiotics.",
      "rationale": "Endometritis occurs when bacteria ascend into the uterus, often due to retained placental fragments or prolonged rupture of membranes. The infection triggers an inflammatory response, leading to systemic symptoms like fever and tachycardia. The foul odor is due to bacterial metabolism."

    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "content": "This is a correct finding (+). Persistent headache with blurred vision is a sign of postpartum preeclampsia. Endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm cause cerebral vasospasm (headache) and retinal arteriolar spasm (blurred vision). This indicates CNS irritability and risk of eclamptic seizure. ClinicalPearl: Check blood pressure immediately; hypertension confirms preeclampsia. SBAR: 0900: Pt c/o severe headache and blurred vision. BP 160/100 mmHg. Possible postpartum preeclampsia. Request order for magnesium sulfate and antihypertensives.",
      "rationale": "Postpartum preeclampsia is caused by persistent endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm, leading to increased blood pressure and reduced blood flow to vital organs, including the brain and eyes. This can progress to seizures (eclampsia) if not treated promptly."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "content": "This is an incorrect finding (-). A 'gush' of rubra lochia when standing is normal. Lochia pools in the vagina while recumbent and is expelled upon standing due to gravity. This differs from postpartum hemorrhage, which involves continuous heavy flow (>1 saturated pad/hour) and hemodynamic instability. ClinicalPearl: Educate the client about normal lochia progression (rubra, serosa, alba).",
      "rationale": "Lochia is the normal uterine discharge after childbirth, consisting of blood, decidual tissue, and mucus. The initial rubra phase is heavier and redder, and pooling of lochia in the vagina is common, leading to a gush upon standing. This is a normal physiological process and not indicative of hemorrhage unless accompanied by excessive bleeding or hemodynamic instability."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "e",
      "content": "This is a correct finding (+). Burning and urgency with urination indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically cystitis. Cesarean delivery often involves indwelling catheters, a major UTI risk factor. Catheters allow bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*) to ascend into the bladder. Postpartum bladder atony can also cause urinary retention, promoting bacterial growth. Untreated UTIs can cause pyelonephritis. ClinicalPearl: Obtain a urine sample for culture and sensitivity. SBAR: 0900: Pt c/o dysuria and urinary urgency. Possible UTI. Request order for urinalysis and antibiotics.",
      "rationale": "Urinary tract infections are common postpartum, especially after cesarean delivery, due to catheterization and bladder atony. The catheter provides a direct pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, while bladder atony leads to urinary stasis, promoting bacterial growth. The symptoms of dysuria and urgency are caused by inflammation of the bladder lining."

    {
      "optionId": "f",
      "content": "This is an incorrect finding (-). Urine output of 600 mL over 12 hours (50 mL/hour) is normal postpartum diuresis. Minimum acceptable output is 30 mL/hour. During pregnancy, body water increases. Postpartum, the body eliminates excess fluid via diuresis and diaphoresis. This output indicates adequate renal function. ClinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of dehydration if diuresis is excessive.",
      "rationale": "During pregnancy, there is a significant increase in total body water. After delivery, the body eliminates this excess fluid through diuresis and diaphoresis. A urine output of 600 mL over 12 hours is within the normal range for postpartum diuresis and indicates adequate renal function."
