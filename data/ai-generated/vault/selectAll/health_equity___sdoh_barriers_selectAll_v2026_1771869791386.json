This is exacerbated in older adults with polypharmacy. Poor vision can cause confusion and anxiety, further decreasing adherence. ClinicalPearl: Always assess visual acuity in older adults, especially those with diabetes or hypertension, as these conditions can affect vision.

Patients may struggle to manage multiple medications with varying dosages and schedules, especially if they have cognitive impairments or low health literacy. This can result in missed doses, incorrect timing, and adverse drug interactions. ClinicalPearl: Simplify medication regimens whenever possible and provide clear, concise instructions.

Patients may struggle to attend follow-up appointments, pick up prescriptions, or access necessary medical services, leading to poorer health outcomes. This is particularly challenging for individuals with chronic conditions requiring frequent monitoring and treatment. ClinicalPearl: Explore telehealth options and community-based resources to overcome transportation barriers.

He exhibits signs of low health literacy. His social support is limited to infrequent phone calls with his daughter who lives out of state. His visual acuity is impaired, making it difficult to read medication labels. Financial resources are limited, impacting his ability to afford medications.
