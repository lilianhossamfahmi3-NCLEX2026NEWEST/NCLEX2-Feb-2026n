        "correct": "Assessing the patient's immediate suicide risk is crucial. This involves directly asking about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means. Safety precautions, such as removing dangerous objects and providing constant supervision, are essential to prevent immediate self-harm. Providing a calm and supportive environment helps reduce anxiety and promote trust. These actions create a foundation for further therapeutic interventions and demonstrate immediate care for the patient's well-being, ensuring their safety during this critical period.",
        "incorrect": "Administering medication without a proper assessment is premature and potentially harmful. Engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is beneficial but not the immediate priority in an acute crisis. Encouraging group activities is helpful for long-term therapy but may be overwhelming for a patient in immediate crisis. Contacting family may be helpful, but the immediate priority is patient safety. The patient has active suicidal ideation, so delaying safety precautions is dangerous.",
