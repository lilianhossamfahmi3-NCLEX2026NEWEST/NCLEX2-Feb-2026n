      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "**Correct (+)**: Publicly criticizing a colleague's clinical skills on social media is unprofessional and potentially defamatory. This action undermines team cohesion and can erode patient safety. The underlying pathophysiology involves the creation of a hostile work environment, leading to decreased communication, increased stress, and potential errors in patient care. This violates the ANA Code of Ethics, specifically provisions related to respect and collaboration. **Clinical Pearl:** Always address concerns about a colleague's performance through appropriate channels, such as direct communication or reporting to a supervisor. SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation) can be used to structure the communication. Example: S: \"I observed a post on Facebook criticizing Nurse X's medication administration skills.\" B: \"Nurse X has been struggling with complex medication calculations recently.\" A: \"This public criticism undermines team morale and could impact patient safety.\" R: \"I recommend addressing this issue with Nurse X and providing additional training and support. 1400\""

    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "**Incorrect (-)**: Sharing a petition for improved nurse-to-patient ratios, while identifying as a nurse, is generally considered protected professional advocacy. The underlying principle is that nurses have a duty to advocate for safe patient care environments. This is often protected under labor laws, allowing employees to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid and protection. **Clinical Pearl:** Nurses have a right to advocate for improved working conditions, but it's crucial to do so in a professional and respectful manner. SBAR: S: \"I am sharing a petition for improved nurse-to-patient ratios.\" B: \"Current staffing levels are impacting our ability to provide safe and timely care.\" A: \"This petition aims to address the staffing shortage and improve patient outcomes.\" R: \"I encourage you to sign the petition and support our efforts to improve patient care. 1500\""
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "**Correct (+)**: 'Stalking' or repeatedly commenting on a former patient's personal photos constitutes a severe breach of professional boundaries. The nurse-patient relationship is inherently unequal, and pursuing a personal relationship after discharge can exploit the patient's vulnerability. The pathophysiology involves the potential for emotional distress, manipulation, and a blurring of professional and personal roles. This violates the ANA Code of Ethics and can lead to legal repercussions. **Clinical Pearl:** Maintain professional boundaries with former patients. Avoid social media contact or personal relationships. SBAR: S: \"I am concerned about a nurse who is repeatedly commenting on a former patient's social media posts.\" B: \"The nurse-patient relationship creates a power imbalance, and this behavior could be perceived as stalking or harassment.\" A: \"This behavior violates professional boundaries and could harm the former patient.\" R: \"I recommend reporting this behavior to the nurse's supervisor and providing education on professional boundaries. 1600\""

    "d": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "**Correct (+)**: Posting a story about a 'difficult patient' using a code name, instead of a real name, still violates HIPAA. The underlying principle is patient confidentiality. HIPAA protects all 'individually identifiable health information.' Even without a name, a patient can be identified through the 'jigsaw effect,' where details like diagnosis, unit, age, events, and timeline can be pieced together. The pathophysiology involves the potential for emotional distress, reputational damage, and legal consequences for the healthcare provider and institution. **Clinical Pearl:** Never share patient information on social media, even if you think it's anonymous. SBAR: S: \"A nurse posted a story about a 'difficult patient' on social media, using a code name.\" B: \"Even without a real name, the patient could be identified through other details in the post.\" A: \"This is a violation of HIPAA and could have serious consequences.\" R: \"I recommend reporting this incident to the privacy officer and providing education on HIPAA regulations. 1700\""

The underlying principle is that nurses have a role in promoting public health and disseminating accurate information. This action does not violate any professional standards and can help combat misinformation. **Clinical Pearl:** Nurses can use social media to share credible health information, but they should always cite their sources and avoid giving individual medical advice. SBAR: S: \"I am sharing an official public health announcement from the CDC on my social media page.\" B: \"This announcement provides important information about a current health issue.\" A: \"Sharing this information can help educate the public and promote healthy behaviors.\" R: \"I encourage others to share this announcement and help spread accurate information. 1800\""

Nurses have a 'duty to report' unsafe practices or breaches of patient confidentiality. The underlying principle is patient safety and ethical conduct. Failure to report such a serious breach could be considered a violation in itself. **Clinical Pearl:** If you witness a HIPAA violation, report it immediately to the appropriate authorities. SBAR: S: \"I witnessed a co-worker posting pictures of patient care on Instagram.\" B: \"This is a violation of HIPAA and could have serious consequences for the patient and the hospital.\" A: \"I am concerned about the potential harm to the patient and the legal ramifications for the hospital.\" R: \"I recommend reporting this incident to HR and the privacy officer immediately. 1900\""

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is the misinterpretation of de-identification. Test-takers may incorrectly believe that removing a patient's name (as in option D) is sufficient to anonymize a post, failing to recognize the legal standard of 'reasonably identifiable information' and the 'jigsaw effect.' A secondary trap is confusing protected professional advocacy for better patient safety (option B) with unprofessional complaining.",
