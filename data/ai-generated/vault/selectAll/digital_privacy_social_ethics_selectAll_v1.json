            "content": "This action constitutes lateral violence and cyberbullying. The mechanism of harm is the degradation of professional team dynamics. Public criticism erodes trust and psychological safety, making colleagues hesitant to communicate openly or ask for help. This breakdown in communication is a direct threat to patient safety, as it can lead to medication errors, missed critical assessments, or failure-to-rescue events. It violates the ANA Code of Ethics, specifically the tenet of treating colleagues with respect and compassion."

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects employees' rights to engage in 'concerted activities' for mutual aid or protection, which includes advocating for safer working conditions like improved staffing ratios. Ethically, nurses have a duty to advocate for conditions that support safe, quality patient care. This action does not violate a professional standard; it upholds the nurse's role as a patient advocate."

        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This behavior is a severe professional boundary violation. The nurse-patient relationship is inherently therapeutic and involves a power differential. Pursuing contact or a relationship after discharge exploits the vulnerability and trust established during care. This can cause significant psychological distress to the former patient and blurs the line between a professional and personal relationship, which is explicitly prohibited by the ANA Code of Ethics and most state Nurse Practice Acts."

        "d": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This is a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The legal principle at risk is patient confidentiality. HIPAA protects all 'individually identifiable health information.' Even without a name, a patient can be identified through the 'jigsaw effect,' where details like diagnosis, unit, age, events, and timeline can be pieced together by others in the community to reveal the patient's identity. Using a 'code name' provides a false sense of security and does not meet the legal standard for de-identification."

Sharing credible, evidence-based information from authoritative sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) promotes public health and combats misinformation. This is a professional and ethical use of a nurse's platform, provided the nurse does not offer individual medical advice."

        "f": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This is not a violation; it is a professional and legal obligation. Nurses have a 'duty to report' unsafe practices or breaches of patient confidentiality. Witnessing a HIPAA violation (posting patient photos) and reporting it through the proper channels (e.g., Human Resources, Compliance Officer) is the correct action to protect patients and uphold the integrity of the profession. Failure to report such a serious breach could be considered a violation in itself."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is the misinterpretation of de-identification. Test-takers may incorrectly believe that removing a patient's name (as in option D) is sufficient to anonymize a post, failing to recognize the legal standard of 'reasonably identifiable information' and the 'jigsaw effect.' A secondary trap is confusing protected professional advocacy for better patient safety (option B) with unprofessional complaining.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the 'POST' method to evaluate social media conduct:\n\n*   **P**atient Privacy: Is any Protected Health Information (PHI) visible or inferable?\n*   **O**nline Professionalism: Does this post uphold the respect, integrity, and boundaries of nursing?\n*   **S**eparate: Is there a clear line between my personal life and my professional role? Am I creating a dual relationship?\n*   **T**ruth & Trust: Is the information accurate and from a credible source? Am I reporting violations to maintain trust in the profession?"
