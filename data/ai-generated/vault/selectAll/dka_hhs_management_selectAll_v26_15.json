        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "In HHS, the primary goal is to correct the severe dehydration and hyperosmolarity. Half-normal saline (0.45% NaCl) is often preferred initially because it is hypotonic compared to plasma, facilitating fluid movement into the cells without causing rapid changes in osmolality. A rate of 200 mL/hr is appropriate given the patient's age and risk for fluid overload. Monitor closely for signs of fluid overload."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "While insulin is necessary in HHS, administering insulin based on sliding scale alone is not ideal. In HHS, insulin is administered at a low, continuous rate (e.g., 0.02-0.05 units/kg/hr) after initial fluid resuscitation to avoid rapid declines in blood glucose and prevent cerebral edema due to rapid shifts in osmolality. Avoid aggressive correction."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Insulin administration can cause a rapid shift of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, potentially leading to hypokalemia. Frequent monitoring (every 2 hours initially) is essential to detect and correct potassium imbalances promptly. Hypokalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias."

        "rationale": "While oral fluid intake is beneficial, it is insufficient to correct the severe dehydration associated with HHS rapidly. Intravenous fluids are necessary to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion. Oral intake can supplement IV fluids as the patient's condition improves."

        "rationale": "Patients with HHS are at risk for cerebral edema, especially during rapid correction of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., level of consciousness, pupillary responses, motor function) are crucial to detect early signs of cerebral edema and intervene promptly. HHS directly impacts cerebral function due to hyperosmolarity."

        "rationale": "In HHS, metabolic acidosis is usually mild and resolves with fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. Sodium bicarbonate is generally not indicated unless the pH is severely low (e.g., < 6.9) and the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Overcorrection of acidosis can lead to paradoxical central nervous system acidosis and hypokalemia."
