        "rationale": "Elevating the HOB promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps to reduce ICP. This is important for patients with ICP monitoring devices. Furthermore, the LVAD benefits from decreased preload, achieved via gravity-assisted venous return reduction.",

        "rationale": "Flushing the LVAD driveline is not a routine nursing intervention and could introduce infection or damage the device. LVAD drivelines have specific care protocols that do not include routine flushing. Instead, meticulous assessment for signs of infection and adherence to sterile technique during dressing changes are paramount.",

      "assessment": "At 0800, patient is somnolent but arousable to voice. GCS is 13 (Eyes 3, Verbal 4, Motor 6). ICP is currently 18 mmHg. LVAD parameters are within normal limits. Neurological exam shows no new focal deficits. Vitals: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 70 bpm (LVAD-supported), RR 16, SpO2 96% on 2L NC, Temp 37.2°C. Small abrasion noted on the forehead. Pupils are equal and reactive.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend notifying the neurosurgeon regarding the elevated ICP. Consider ordering a CT scan of the head to rule out new hemorrhage. Evaluate the need for mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce ICP. Continue close neurological monitoring and LVAD parameter assessment. Strict I/O monitoring is essential. Implement seizure precautions."
