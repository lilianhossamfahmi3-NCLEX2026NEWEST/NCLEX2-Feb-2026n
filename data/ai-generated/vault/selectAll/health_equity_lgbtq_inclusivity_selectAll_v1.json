For transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, hearing their chosen name affirms their identity, which mitigates the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This validation promotes psychological safety, fosters a therapeutic alliance, and is critical for accurate information gathering and subsequent treatment adherence. **ClinicalPearl:** Always prioritize using the client's chosen name to build trust and rapport.",

Misgendering acts as a persistent microaggression, contributing to the chronic stress (allostatic load) that elevates cortisol levels and increases long-term risk for anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease in gender-diverse individuals. Correct documentation ensures the continuity of respectful care, thus mitigating this specific pathophysiological stress pathway. **ClinicalPearl:** Documenting pronouns in the EHR is a crucial step in providing respectful and affirming care.",

When a nurse makes an incorrect assumption (e.g., asking a gay man about his 'wife'), the client is forced into the stressful act of self-correction. This can trigger anxiety and erode trust. Using inclusive language like 'partner' prevents this potential stressor, signaling that the client's relationships are valid and facilitating open disclosure about their support systems, a key social determinant of health. **ClinicalPearl:** Using gender-neutral language demonstrates respect and avoids making harmful assumptions.",
