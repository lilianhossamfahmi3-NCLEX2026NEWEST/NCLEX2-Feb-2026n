He reports increased shortness of breath and wheezing for the past three days.\n\n**Background:** Mr. Jones has a history of asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He has been using his albuterol inhaler more frequently (every 2-3 hours) over the past few days with minimal relief. He reports missing several doctor's appointments due to transportation issues. Lives alone and states, \"I feel so alone these days, my family doesn’t visit much.\" He also states, \"I can't afford the good stuff at the store, so I eat what I can.\"\n\n**Assessment:** Upon arrival at 14:30, Mr. Jones's vital signs were: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 89% on room air. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Lab results show an elevated WBC count of 14,000/µL and a low albumin level of 3.0 g/dL.\n\n**Recommendation:** I recommend initiating continuous nebulized albuterol treatments, administering IV corticosteroids, and consulting with respiratory therapy for further evaluation and management of his asthma exacerbation. A social work consult is needed to address transportation, food insecurity, and social isolation concerns.",
