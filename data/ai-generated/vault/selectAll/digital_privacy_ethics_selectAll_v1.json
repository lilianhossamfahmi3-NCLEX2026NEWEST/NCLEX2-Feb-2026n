HIPAA defines 18 identifiers, and even seemingly benign details can be combined (the 'jigsaw effect') to re-identify a patient. Another trap is 'benevolent intent,' where a nurse believes an action is justified because it's meant to be helpful (e.g., checking on a patient online), but this does not override the legal and ethical requirement to maintain professional boundaries and a strict 'need-to-know' basis for accessing information. Students may also incorrectly assume that if a patient initiates contact on social media, it's acceptable for the nurse to reciprocate."

Other identifying details such as handwriting, specific wording, or context related to the nurse's workplace can be pieced together to identify the patient (the 'jigsaw effect'). This constitutes an unauthorized disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). **Rationale:** HIPAA's Privacy Rule aims to protect individually identifiable health information. The 'jigsaw effect' highlights the risk of re-identification even with seemingly anonymized data. **Clinical Pearl:** Always consider the context and potential for re-identification when sharing patient-related information, even if names are omitted. Obtain explicit consent before posting any patient-related content."

Describing a 'crazy day' on a personal blog can violate HIPAA if enough specific clinical details are included that the patient could be identified, even without names or dates. This indirect disclosure is a breach of confidentiality. **Rationale:** HIPAA defines PHI broadly to include any information that could reasonably be used to identify an individual. Sharing specific details about a patient case can inadvertently reveal sensitive patient information. **Clinical Pearl:** Avoid sharing specific details about patient cases on personal blogs or social media, even if names and dates are omitted. Focus on general experiences and lessons learned, ensuring no patient can be identified."

                "content": "Correct. Using a personal smartphone to photograph a rare clinical finding violates the HIPAA Security Rule. Personal smartphones are not secure, encrypted, facility-approved devices. Storing a clinical image (which is PHI) on it creates an unsecured electronic copy of patient data, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access. **Rationale:** The HIPAA Security Rule mandates administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic PHI. Using personal devices bypasses these safeguards, increasing the risk of data breaches. **Clinical Pearl:** Always use hospital-approved devices and systems for capturing and storing patient images. Never use personal devices for this purpose. Ensure all devices used for patient information are encrypted and password-protected."

                "content": "Correct. Accessing the electronic health record of a former neighbor, without a current care relationship, violates the 'minimum necessary' and 'role-based access' principles of HIPAA. Access to the EHR is strictly limited to patients under direct care for treatment, payment, or operations (TPO). **Rationale:** HIPAA's 'minimum necessary' standard limits access to PHI to only those individuals who need it to perform their job duties. Unauthorized access is a serious violation. **Clinical Pearl:** Only access patient records for whom you have a legitimate need to know as part of your job responsibilities. Curiosity is never a valid reason to access a patient's EHR. Regularly review audit trails to ensure appropriate access."

The nurse-patient relationship must remain therapeutic and objective. **Rationale:** Professional boundaries are essential for maintaining a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. Social media monitoring blurs these boundaries and can create conflicts of interest. **Clinical Pearl:** Avoid interacting with patients on social media. Maintain a professional distance and focus on providing objective, evidence-based care. If concerned about a patient's adherence, address it directly through appropriate clinical channels."

Sharing a patient's room number with a religious leader who asks about the patient by name, without confirming the patient's consent, violates the patient's right to control their directory information. A patient's location in a facility is PHI and can only be shared if the patient has not opted out of the facility directory and has given consent. **Rationale:** HIPAA grants patients the right to control the disclosure of their directory information. Sharing this information without consent violates patient autonomy. **Clinical Pearl:** Always verify that a patient has not opted out of the facility directory before sharing their location. Obtain explicit consent before disclosing this information to anyone. Follow facility policy on directory information disclosure."

Reinforce the 'SNAP' mnemonic and provide regular training on evolving digital privacy threats."
