      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. **SBAR (1400): Situation:** New onset stridor or laryngeal edema. **Background:** Patient receiving monoclonal antibody infusion. **Assessment:** Indicates potential anaphylaxis and airway obstruction. **Recommendation:** Immediately stop infusion and prepare for airway management. Stridor is a high-pitched, whistling sound during inspiration, indicating turbulent airflow through a narrowed upper airway. Monoclonal antibodies can trigger Type I hypersensitivity reactions, leading to mast cell degranulation and release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators. These mediators cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. In the larynx, this results in edema and bronchospasm, obstructing airflow. Without immediate intervention, respiratory arrest can occur. **Clinical Pearl:** Always assess airway patency first in any suspected infusion reaction.",

      "content": "Correct. **SBAR (1401): Situation:** Blood pressure drop from 124/80 mmHg to 88/54 mmHg. **Background:** Patient receiving monoclonal antibody infusion. **Assessment:** Indicates distributive shock. **Recommendation:** Immediately stop infusion, administer IV fluids, and consider vasopressors. A significant drop in blood pressure indicates distributive shock, likely due to anaphylaxis or cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Monoclonal antibodies can activate the complement system and immune cells, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6. These cytokines cause systemic vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to a rapid decrease in systemic vascular resistance and intravascular volume. This results in hypotension, tissue hypoperfusion, and potentially organ damage. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood pressure closely during and after monoclonal antibody infusions.",

Generalized urticaria and pruritus are classic signs of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies. The monoclonal antibody binds to IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils, causing degranulation and release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine binds to H1 receptors in the skin, causing vasodilation (erythema/flare), increased capillary permeability (edema/wheals), and nerve stimulation (pruritus). While not immediately life-threatening, widespread urticaria can progress to anaphylaxis. **Clinical Pearl:** Urticaria is often an early sign of a more severe reaction.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. A temperature rise of 0.5°F (0.3°C) is clinically insignificant and does not, by itself, warrant immediate cessation. While fever can be a sign of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a component of infusion reactions, a severe reaction is typically characterized by a much higher temperature (e.g., >100.4°F or 38°C). CRS is caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines from activated immune cells. A minor temperature fluctuation requires closer monitoring but is not an indication of a life-threatening acute process. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor temperature trends, not just single readings.",

Chest tightness and shortness of breath are critical signs of bronchospasm, indicating airway narrowing and impaired gas exchange. Monoclonal antibodies can trigger the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators that cause smooth muscle contraction in the bronchioles. This bronchoconstriction increases airway resistance, making it difficult for the patient to breathe. The resulting hypoxemia can lead to respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess breath sounds frequently during monoclonal antibody infusions.",

Patients are frequently given pre-medications such as diphenhydramine (an H1-receptor antagonist with sedative properties) and corticosteroids to blunt potential reactions. Diphenhydramine crosses the blood-brain barrier and blocks histamine receptors in the brain, causing drowsiness. These symptoms do not reflect the acute pathophysiology of anaphylaxis or severe CRS. **Clinical Pearl:** Differentiate between medication side effects and true infusion reactions.",

  },
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between common, manageable side effects (or effects of pre-medication) and the signs of a true life-threatening emergency. A mild temperature change or fatigue may cause a novice nurse to either overreact by stopping the infusion unnecessarily or, more dangerously, underreact by dismissing early but critical signs like hypotension or chest tightness as less severe side effects. The key is to link the clinical finding directly to the pathophysiology of airway, breathing, or circulation compromise.",
  "mnemonics": "For severe infusion reactions, remember the 'ABC-S' mnemonic to prioritize assessment:\n\n*   **A**irway: Stridor, angioedema, hoarseness\n*   **B**reathing: Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, tachypnea\n*   **C**irculation: Hypotension, tachycardia, shock\n*   **S**kin: Systemic urticaria, flushing, pruritus (often an early sign)",

  "explanation": "This question requires the nurse to identify signs and symptoms of an acute infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody and prioritize actions based on the SBAR communication framework. Stridor, hypotension, urticaria, and chest tightness all indicate a severe reaction requiring immediate intervention. Mild fatigue is a common side effect and not a priority. The nurse must be able to differentiate between expected side effects and life-threatening complications.",
