        "a": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Stridor is a high-pitched, inspiratory sound caused by turbulent airflow through a narrowed upper airway. In an infusion reaction, mast cell degranulation releases massive amounts of histamine and leukotrienes. These mediators cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability in the laryngeal tissues, leading to acute edema and life-threatening airway obstruction. This is an absolute emergency requiring immediate cessation of the infusion and airway management."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. This significant drop in blood pressure (a 36 mmHg systolic and 26 mmHg diastolic decrease) indicates distributive shock. The infusion triggers a systemic inflammatory response, releasing vasodilatory mediators like histamine, prostaglandins, and cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6). This leads to widespread vasodilation and capillary leak, causing a rapid shift of fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space. The resulting decrease in systemic vascular resistance and intravascular volume causes profound hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion, which is a medical emergency."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Generalized urticaria (widespread hives) and pruritus are hallmark signs of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction. This is caused by IgE antibodies cross-linking on the surface of mast cells and basophils, triggering degranulation and the release of histamine. In the skin, histamine binds to H1 receptors, causing local vasodilation (erythema/flare) and increased permeability of dermal capillaries, which results in fluid extravasation and the formation of edematous wheals. Widespread presentation indicates a systemic reaction that can escalate."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. A temperature rise of 0.5°F (0.3°C) is clinically insignificant and does not, by itself, warrant immediate cessation. While fever can be a sign of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a component of infusion reactions, a severe reaction is typically characterized by a much higher temperature (e.g., >100.4°F or 38°C). This minor fluctuation requires closer monitoring but is not an indication of a life-threatening acute process."
        },
        "e": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Chest tightness and shortness of breath are critical signs of bronchospasm. Similar to their effects in the vasculature, released mediators like histamine and leukotrienes act on receptors in the smooth muscle of the bronchioles. This stimulation causes intense bronchoconstriction, narrowing the lower airways and increasing mucus production. The patient experiences this as chest tightness and difficulty breathing (dyspnea), which compromises gas exchange and represents a severe respiratory component of the infusion reaction."
        },
        "f": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Mild fatigue and sleepiness are common, expected findings and not indicative of an acute, life-threatening infusion reaction. Patients are frequently given pre-medications such as diphenhydramine (an H1-receptor antagonist with sedative properties) and corticosteroids to blunt potential reactions. The sedative effect of diphenhydramine is the most likely cause of these symptoms. They do not reflect the acute pathophysiology of anaphylaxis or severe CRS."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between common, manageable side effects (or effects of pre-medication) and the signs of a true life-threatening emergency. A mild temperature change or fatigue may cause a novice nurse to either overreact by stopping the infusion unnecessarily or, more dangerously, underreact by dismissing early but critical signs like hypotension or chest tightness as less severe side effects. The key is to link the clinical finding directly to the pathophysiology of airway, breathing, or circulation compromise.",
    "mnemonics": "For severe infusion reactions, remember the 'ABC-S' mnemonic to prioritize assessment:\n\n*   **A**irway: Stridor, angioedema, hoarseness\n*   **B**reathing: Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, tachypnea\n*   **C**irculation: Hypotension, tachycardia, shock\n*   **S**kin: Systemic urticaria, flushing, pruritus (often an early sign)",
