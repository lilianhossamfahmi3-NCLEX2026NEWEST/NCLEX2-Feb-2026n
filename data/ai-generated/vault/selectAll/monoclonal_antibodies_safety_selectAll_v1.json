    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Stridor or laryngeal edema indicates a compromised airway, potentially due to anaphylaxis. The nurse should immediately stop the infusion and prepare for airway management. Stridor is a high-pitched sound indicating upper airway obstruction.",

    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. A significant drop in blood pressure indicates circulatory compromise, potentially due to anaphylaxis or cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The nurse should immediately stop the infusion, administer IV fluids, and consider vasopressors.",
      "rationale": "Hypotension indicates circulatory compromise and requires immediate intervention."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Generalized urticaria and pruritus are signs of a hypersensitivity reaction. While not immediately life-threatening, they can progress to anaphylaxis. The nurse should immediately stop the infusion and administer antihistamines.",
      "rationale": "Urticaria indicates a hypersensitivity reaction that can progress to anaphylaxis."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. A temperature rise of 0.5°F (0.3°C) is clinically insignificant and does not, by itself, warrant immediate cessation. While fever can be a sign of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a severe reaction is typically characterized by a much higher temperature.",
      "rationale": "A slight temperature increase alone is not indicative of a severe reaction."
    },
    "e": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Chest tightness and shortness of breath are signs of bronchospasm, indicating airway narrowing and impaired gas exchange. The nurse should immediately stop the infusion, administer oxygen, and consider bronchodilators.",
      "rationale": "Chest tightness and shortness of breath indicate respiratory compromise requiring immediate intervention."
    },
    "f": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Mild fatigue and sleepiness are common side effects, potentially due to pre-medications, and not indicative of an acute, life-threatening infusion reaction.",
      "rationale": "Fatigue and sleepiness are likely due to pre-medications and not indicative of a severe reaction."

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between common, manageable side effects (or effects of pre-medication) and the signs of a true life-threatening emergency. Focus on signs of airway, breathing, or circulation compromise.",

    "Monoclonal antibody infusions can cause severe reactions. Vigilant monitoring is crucial.",
    "Pre-medications can mask early signs of a reaction. Be cautious.",
    "Prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation when assessing for infusion reactions.",
    "Use the SBAR framework to communicate findings clearly.",
    "Document all assessments and interventions meticulously."
  ],
  "explanation": "This question requires the nurse to identify signs and symptoms of an acute infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody and prioritize actions based on the SBAR communication framework. Stridor, hypotension, urticaria, and chest tightness all indicate a severe reaction requiring immediate intervention. Mild fatigue is a common side effect and not a priority. The nurse must differentiate between expected side effects and life-threatening complications.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Clinical rationale is aligned with best practice guidelines for managing infusion reactions. The correct options represent signs of severe hypersensitivity or cytokine release syndrome requiring immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications."
