These conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age include socioeconomic factors, such as income, education, access to healthcare, and social support networks. Mr. Jackson's situation highlights several SDOH barriers: food insecurity due to financial constraints, lack of reliable transportation limiting access to healthcare, social isolation from living alone, and significant financial strain making it difficult to afford medications and other necessities. Addressing these barriers is crucial for improving Mr. Jackson's health outcomes and promoting health equity.
