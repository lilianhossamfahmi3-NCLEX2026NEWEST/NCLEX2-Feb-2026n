Initial assessment revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.",

He states he hasn't seen a doctor in over two years due to lack of transportation and difficulty scheduling appointments. He also mentions that he often skips meals to save money.",

He is currently on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula, with SpO2 now at 92%. He is alert and oriented but appears fatigued. He reports difficulty affording his medications.",

We should also consider a nutritional consult to address his food insecurity. A referral for smoking cessation resources is also recommended, as he admits to smoking one pack per day for the past 40 years."
