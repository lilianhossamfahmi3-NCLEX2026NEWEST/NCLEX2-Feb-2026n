      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct (+). In an emergency (e.g., 1400), a bag-valve-mask (BVM) with a tracheostomy adapter or pediatric mask is crucial for immediate positive pressure ventilation. A tracheostomy bypasses the upper airway, making a standard mask ineffective. The adapter ensures a tight seal over the stoma, delivering oxygen directly to the lungs. Without this, adequate ventilation is impossible, leading to rapid hypoxemia and potential cardiac arrest. Pathophysiology: Bypassing the natural airway eliminates the ability to create a seal with a standard face mask. Clinical Pearl: Always confirm the BVM is functional and the adapter is readily accessible. ",

      "content": "Correct (+). The obturator is a smooth, rounded guide used to facilitate tracheostomy tube insertion. It minimizes trauma to the tracheal tissues during insertion, especially in a fresh tracheostomy (e.g., <7 days old). Pathophysiology: A fresh stoma is prone to bleeding and damage. The obturator prevents scraping or perforation of the tracheal wall. Clinical Pearl: Keep the obturator taped near the bedside for immediate access during accidental decannulation (e.g., 0300).",

      "content": "Correct (+). Having two spare tracheostomy tubes (one the same size and one a size smaller) is vital. A fresh tracheostomy stoma can close rapidly if the tube is dislodged (e.g., 2200). The same-size tube is for routine replacement. The smaller-size tube is crucial if the stoma has begun to narrow due to edema or tissue contraction. Pathophysiology: Post-surgical inflammation can cause rapid stoma constriction. Clinical Pearl: Ensure the spare tubes are easily accessible and that staff are trained in their proper insertion.",

      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct (+). A working suction system with appropriate catheters is essential. Tracheostomy tubes bypass the natural humidification and filtering functions of the upper airway, leading to thicker, more tenacious secretions. These secretions can quickly obstruct the airway (e.g., 0600), causing respiratory distress. Pathophysiology: Bypassing the upper airway increases the risk of mucus plugging.

The stoma can close rapidly, making reinsertion difficult or impossible. Pathophysiology: A fresh stoma is not fully epithelialized and can collapse quickly.

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing routine tracheostomy *care* items with emergency tracheostomy *rescue* equipment.
