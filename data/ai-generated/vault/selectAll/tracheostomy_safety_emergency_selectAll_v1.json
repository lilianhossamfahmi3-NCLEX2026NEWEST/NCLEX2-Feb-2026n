Ensure emergency equipment is readily available at the bedside.\nRecommendation: Maintain the bedside safety equipment as listed above. Ensure staff are trained in emergency tracheostomy management. Suction as needed to maintain a patent airway. Notify the provider immediately if decannulation occurs or if there are signs of respiratory distress."
