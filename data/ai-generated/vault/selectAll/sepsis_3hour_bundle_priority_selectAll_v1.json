In sepsis, systemic vasodilation and capillary leak lead to profound tissue hypoperfusion.

The goal is to identify the specific causative pathogen to de-escalate from broad-spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy later. Administering antibiotics first can sterilize the blood, leading to false-negative cultures and making pathogen identification impossible. However, this step must not delay antibiotic administration by more than 45 minutes."

Sepsis triggers a massive release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., nitric oxide), causing widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. This shifts fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space, creating a state of relative hypovolemia. The rapid infusion of crystalloids directly expands intravascular volume, increasing preload, cardiac output, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to restore organ perfusion."

The underlying cause of sepsis is an uncontrolled infection. Each hour of delay allows for logarithmic bacterial replication, which fuels the systemic inflammatory cascade. This cascade damages the vascular endothelium, activates the coagulation system (risk for DIC), and leads to progressive organ failure. Promptly administering antibiotics halts this process at its source."

Septic shock is a medical emergency where time to intervention directly impacts survival. While an abnormal WBC is a diagnostic criterion, the inflammatory cascade is already causing life-threatening organ hypoperfusion. The clinical suspicion of septic shock mandates immediate action; waiting for this specific lab result allows the infection and subsequent organ damage to progress unchecked."
