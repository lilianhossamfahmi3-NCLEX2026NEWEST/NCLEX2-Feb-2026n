    "content": "The most common and critical distractor in PE/DVT questions is differentiating unilateral from bilateral leg swelling. Candidates correctly associate leg swelling with DVT risk but must recognize that DVT causes *unilateral* signs due to localized venous obstruction. Bilateral edema points to a systemic condition like heart failure, which requires an entirely different diagnostic and treatment pathway. Misinterpreting this cue could lead to a failure to rescue."

The left calf appears slightly larger than the right, but no obvious edema is present.",
    "recommendation": "The nurse recommends immediate notification of the healthcare provider to order a CT angiography to rule out PE. The nurse will also prepare to administer oxygen and initiate anticoagulation therapy as prescribed. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is essential."
