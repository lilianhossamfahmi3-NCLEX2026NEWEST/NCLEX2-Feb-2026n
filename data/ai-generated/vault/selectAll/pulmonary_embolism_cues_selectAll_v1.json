    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Sudden pleuritic chest pain is a common symptom of PE. The embolus obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to ischemia and potential infarction of lung tissue. This triggers inflammation, irritating the parietal pleura, which is highly sensitive to pain. The pain is often sharp and localized, worsening with deep inspiration or coughing due to friction between the inflamed pleural layers.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Pleuritic chest pain in the context of dyspnea should always raise suspicion for PE."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Bilateral lower extremity edema is more indicative of systemic fluid overload, such as that seen in heart failure, renal failure, or hepatic insufficiency. These conditions cause increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, leading to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space. PE is typically associated with *unilateral* leg swelling if it originates from a DVT.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Differentiate between unilateral (DVT) and bilateral (systemic) edema when assessing for PE risk."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism in response to the hypoxemia and increased pulmonary vascular resistance caused by the PE. The body attempts to increase cardiac output to deliver more oxygen to the tissues. The sympathetic nervous system is activated, releasing catecholamines that stimulate the sinoatrial node, increasing heart rate.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Tachycardia is an early and often subtle sign of PE, especially in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Hypoxemia results from a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The embolus obstructs blood flow to a portion of the lung, creating alveolar dead space where ventilation occurs without perfusion. Blood passing through these non-perfused alveoli does not get oxygenated, leading to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor oxygen saturation closely in patients at risk for PE, and be prepared to administer supplemental oxygen."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Recent surgery or limb immobilization are significant risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including DVT and PE. Surgery can cause endothelial damage and activate the coagulation cascade, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Immobilization promotes venous stasis, increasing the risk of thrombus formation. These factors contribute to Virchow's triad (stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial injury).",
      "clinicalPearl": "Prophylactic anticoagulation and early ambulation are crucial for preventing VTE in postoperative and immobilized patients."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, can occur when a PE causes pulmonary infarction. The embolus obstructs blood flow to a distal vessel, leading to necrosis of the lung parenchyma. This damages the alveolar-capillary membrane, causing blood to leak into the alveoli and be expectorated.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hemoptysis in the setting of suspected PE suggests a more severe event with potential lung infarction."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "The Unilateral vs. Bilateral Trap",
    "content": "The most common and critical distractor in PE/DVT questions is differentiating unilateral from bilateral leg swelling. Candidates correctly associate leg swelling with DVT risk but must recognize that DVT causes *unilateral* signs due to localized venous obstruction. Bilateral edema points to a systemic condition like heart failure, which requires an entirely different diagnostic and treatment pathway. Misinterpreting this cue could lead to a failure to rescue."

    "situation": "The nurse is evaluating a client for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).",
    "background": "The client presents with symptoms suggestive of PE, including sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. The client's medical history reveals a recent total knee arthroplasty performed 3 weeks ago. The client has been less mobile since the surgery.",
    "assessment": "At 1400, the nurse assesses the client and notes the following: heart rate of 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 89% on room air, and reports of sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. The left calf appears slightly larger than the right, but no obvious edema is present.",
    "recommendation": "The nurse recommends immediate notification of the healthcare provider to order a CT angiography to rule out PE. The nurse will also prepare to administer oxygen and initiate anticoagulation therapy as prescribed. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is essential."
