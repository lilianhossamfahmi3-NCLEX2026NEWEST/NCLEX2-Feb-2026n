The client's medical history reveals a recent total knee arthroplasty performed 3 weeks ago. The client has been less mobile since the surgery.\nAssessment: At 1400, the nurse assesses the client and notes the following: heart rate of 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 89% on room air, and reports of sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. The left calf appears slightly larger than the right, but no obvious edema is present.\nRecommendation: The nurse recommends immediate notification of the healthcare provider to order a CT angiography to rule out PE. The nurse will also prepare to administer oxygen and initiate anticoagulation therapy as prescribed. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is essential."
