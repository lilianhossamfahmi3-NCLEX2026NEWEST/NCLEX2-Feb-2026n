            "content": "A pulmonary embolus obstructs a pulmonary artery, leading to downstream ischemia and infarction of lung tissue. This process triggers an intense inflammatory response that irritates the parietal pleura. The pleura is innervated by somatic pain fibers, causing a sharp, localized pain that intensifies with deep inspiration or coughing as the inflamed pleural surfaces rub together."

            "content": "This finding points away from a PE. Bilateral lower extremity edema suggests a systemic cause, such as right-sided heart failure, renal failure, or hepatic insufficiency, which lead to generalized fluid volume overload. The classic precursor to a PE is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which typically causes *unilateral* swelling, redness, and pain due to venous outflow obstruction in a single limb."

            "correct": true,
            "content": "Tachycardia is a primary compensatory response. The embolus increases pulmonary vascular resistance, which in turn increases the right ventricular afterload. To maintain cardiac output against this obstruction and compensate for the resulting hypoxemia, the sympathetic nervous system is activated. This releases catecholamines, stimulating the sinoatrial node and increasing the heart rate."

            "correct": true,
            "content": "Hypoxemia is a direct consequence of a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The embolus blocks blood flow (perfusion) to a section of the lung that is still being ventilated. This creates alveolar dead space, where gas exchange cannot occur. Blood is shunted past these non-perfused alveoli, resulting in deoxygenated blood returning to the left atrium and causing systemic hypoxemia."

            "correct": true,
            "content": "This addresses Virchow's triad for thrombus formation. Major surgery causes endothelial injury and induces a hypercoagulable state. Immobilization leads to venous stasis in the lower extremities. This combination of stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial damage is the fundamental pathophysiology for the development of a DVT, which is the source of over 90% of pulmonary emboli."

            "correct": true,
            "content": "Hemoptysis is a specific, albeit less common, sign that suggests pulmonary infarction. When the embolus is large enough to completely occlude a distal vessel, the lung parenchyma supplied by that vessel can become necrotic. This tissue death damages the alveolar-capillary membrane, causing extravasation of red blood cells into the alveoli, which are then coughed up."

Candidates correctly associate leg swelling with DVT risk but must recognize that DVT causes *unilateral* signs due to localized venous obstruction. Bilateral edema points to a systemic condition like heart failure, which requires an entirely different diagnostic and treatment pathway. Misinterpreting this cue could lead to a failure to rescue."
