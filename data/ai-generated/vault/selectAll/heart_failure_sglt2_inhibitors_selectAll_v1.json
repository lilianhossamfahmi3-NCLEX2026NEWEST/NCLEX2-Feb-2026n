  "rationale": {
    "correct": "SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) are a cornerstone of HFrEF therapy, reducing hospitalizations and improving outcomes. These medications work by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubule, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism has several implications for patient education and safety. \n\n**(A & B) Genitourinary Infections:** The increased glucose in the urine creates a favorable environment for fungal (yeast) and bacterial growth, significantly increasing the risk of genital fungal infections and UTIs. Patients must be vigilant in monitoring for symptoms such as itching, burning, discharge, or urinary frequency/urgency and report them promptly. \n\n**(C) Dehydration:** SGLT2 inhibitors have a mild diuretic effect, promoting sodium and water excretion. This can lead to dehydration, especially in patients already at risk due to heart failure. Maintaining adequate fluid intake is crucial to prevent hypovolemia and associated complications.\n\n**(E) Foot Ulcers/Amputations:** While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, some SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of lower limb amputations and foot ulcers, particularly in patients with pre-existing peripheral artery disease or neuropathy. Daily foot checks are essential for early detection and management of any new sores or ulcers.\n\n**(F) Euglycemic DKA:** A rare but life-threatening side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This condition occurs when the body produces ketones due to a lack of glucose utilization, despite relatively normal blood glucose levels. Symptoms include severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Prompt medical attention is crucial.",
    "incorrect": "**(D) Hyperkalemia:** SGLT2 inhibitors do not typically cause hyperkalemia. This side effect is more commonly associated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone), which are often used in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure management. It's important to differentiate the potential side effects of each medication.",
