            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Severe pain that is out of proportion to the injury, especially pain that is not relieved by opioid analgesics, is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome. This occurs due to increasing pressure on nerve endings within the affected muscle compartment. The escalating pain indicates that the pressure is building and compressing the nerves, leading to intense discomfort despite pain medication. ClinicalPearl: Unrelieved pain, despite analgesics, is a red flag for compartment syndrome."

While vascular compromise can occur as compartment syndrome progresses, it is a later sign. Early compartment syndrome primarily affects nerve function due to increased pressure. QuestionTrap: Do not assume normal capillary refill excludes compartment syndrome; neurological signs are more sensitive early indicators."

            "rationale": "Paresthesia, often described as a pins-and-needles sensation, is an early neurological sign of compartment syndrome. It is caused by increased pressure on the nerves within the affected compartment, leading to nerve ischemia and altered sensation. This symptom indicates that the nerves are being compressed and are not functioning properly. ClinicalPearl: Paresthesia is an important early warning sign that should prompt immediate investigation."

            "rationale": "The presence of a palpable pedal pulse does not rule out compartment syndrome, especially in the early stages. Pulselessness is a late sign, indicating significant vascular compromise. The absence of a pulse suggests severe compression of blood vessels, which occurs as the pressure within the compartment increases substantially. QuestionTrap: Presence of a pulse does NOT exclude compartment syndrome; absence of pulse is a late and ominous sign."

            "rationale": "Swelling and a tight, firm feeling in the affected compartment are indicative of increased pressure within the compartment, a key characteristic of compartment syndrome. The increased pressure is due to edema and bleeding within the confined space of the muscle compartment. This firmness is a palpable sign of the elevated pressure. ClinicalPearl: Assess the affected limb for tenseness and induration to evaluate for increased compartment pressure."

            "rationale": "While early on the client might have some movement, pain will increase on passive stretching of the affected muscles. Inability to move the extremity is a later finding. Early on, pain with movement is more common. As compartment syndrome progresses, the client will experience increasing pain with any movement, eventually leading to paralysis if the pressure is not relieved. QuestionTrap: Do not be misled by the presence of initial movement; focus on the increasing pain with movement as a key indicator."

He's a 47-year-old male, post-op ORIF tibia fracture, 6 hours ago.\n\nSituation: Mr. Smith is reporting increasing pain in his left leg, rated 10/10, unrelieved by morphine 4mg IV given at 06:30. The leg is increasingly swollen and firm. He reports tingling in his toes, which started about an hour ago. I am concerned he is developing acute compartment syndrome.\n\nBackground: He underwent ORIF of a tibia fracture 6 hours ago. His pain was controlled initially with morphine, but it has progressively worsened over the last two hours.\n\nAssessment: Pain is 10/10, swelling and firmness of the left leg, paresthesia in toes. BP: 130/80 mmHg, HR: 90 bpm, RR: 18, SpO2: 98% on room air, Temp: 37.0°C (98.6°F). Pedal pulse is palpable, and capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate evaluation by the surgical team for possible compartment syndrome. I am also concerned about potential nerve damage given the tingling. I have elevated the leg to heart level and placed ice packs.",
