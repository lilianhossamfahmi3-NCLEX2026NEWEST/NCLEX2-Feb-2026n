He's reporting increasing pain in his left leg, rated 10/10, unrelieved by morphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes ago. The leg is increasingly swollen and firm. He reports tingling in his toes. Capillary refill is <3 seconds, pedal pulse palpable. Situation: Severe pain despite analgesics, potential compartment syndrome. Background: ORIF tibia fracture 6 hours ago. Pain was controlled initially. Assessment: Pain 10/10, swelling, firmness, paresthesia. Pulses present, cap refill <3 sec. Recommendation: I think the patient is developing compartment syndrome and needs immediate evaluation by the surgical team. I am also concerned about potential nerve damage given the tingling.",
