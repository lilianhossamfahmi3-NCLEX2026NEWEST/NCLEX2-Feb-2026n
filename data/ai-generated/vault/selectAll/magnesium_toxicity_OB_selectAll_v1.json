Urine output decreases, and magnesium accumulates in the bloodstream. Respiratory rate decreases due to CNS depression. A serum magnesium level of 10.5 mEq/L is significantly elevated and falls within the toxic range.",

Seizure activity (option B) is a sign of subtherapeutic magnesium levels or disease progression, NOT toxicity. Another common pitfall is misidentifying an expected side effect, such as feeling flushed (option F), as a toxic manifestation. The nurse must differentiate between expected effects, adverse effects, and life-threatening toxicity."

These findings indicate magnesium toxicity.\nRecommendation: Discontinue magnesium sulfate infusion immediately. Prepare to administer calcium gluconate per protocol. Notify the physician immediately. Monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and DTRs every 5-15 minutes. Anticipate possible respiratory support. Document all interventions and client responses. Time: 1400."
