    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Magnesium toxicity manifests as central nervous system (CNS) depression and neuromuscular blockade. Magnesium ions competitively inhibit calcium influx at the neuromuscular junction, reducing acetylcholine release. This leads to muscle weakness, initially seen as hyporeflexia and progressing to areflexia (absent DTRs). Absent DTRs typically occur at magnesium levels of 7-10 mEq/L. Monitor DTRs hourly and report diminished or absent reflexes immediately.",
      "rationale": "Magnesium sulfate's mechanism of action involves blocking calcium channels, which are crucial for nerve and muscle function. Excessive blockade leads to decreased neuronal excitability and muscle relaxation, resulting in areflexia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Assess DTRs before and during magnesium sulfate administration. A decrease or absence of DTRs is an early sign of magnesium toxicity and warrants immediate intervention."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Tonic-clonic seizures are characteristic of eclampsia, a severe complication of preeclampsia that magnesium sulfate is used to prevent. Magnesium sulfate acts as a CNS depressant, raising the seizure threshold. Seizure activity indicates a subtherapeutic magnesium level or worsening preeclampsia, not magnesium toxicity. The therapeutic range for seizure prophylaxis is 4-7 mEq/L.",
      "rationale": "Magnesium sulfate's anticonvulsant properties stem from its ability to block NMDA receptors and reduce neuronal excitability in the brain. Seizures indicate that the magnesium level is insufficient to achieve this effect.",
      "clinicalPearl": "If a client experiences a seizure while on magnesium sulfate, immediately administer a bolus dose as prescribed and notify the healthcare provider. Consider other causes of seizures if magnesium levels are therapeutic."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Severe preeclampsia can cause renal vasoconstriction and glomerular endotheliosis, reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A urine output of 20 mL/hour (oliguria) indicates impaired renal function. This prevents magnesium excretion, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream and causing toxicity. Monitor urine output hourly and report values <30 mL/hr.",
      "rationale": "Reduced GFR impairs the kidneys' ability to clear magnesium, leading to elevated serum levels. This is exacerbated by the fact that preeclampsia itself can damage the kidneys.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Maintain strict intake and output records. Oliguria is a critical sign of impending magnesium toxicity, especially in the setting of preeclampsia."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Magnesium toxicity causes significant CNS depression. High serum concentrations of magnesium directly suppress the respiratory control center in the medulla oblongata. Simultaneously, the neuromuscular blockade effect weakens the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. This dual mechanism leads to a decreased respiratory rate (bradypnea) and shallow breathing, potentially progressing to respiratory arrest. A respiratory rate of <12 breaths/minute is a critical sign of toxicity.",
      "rationale": "Magnesium's CNS depressant effects impair the brain's ability to regulate breathing. The neuromuscular blockade further weakens the muscles required for respiration.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Continuously monitor respiratory rate and depth. Have calcium gluconate (the antidote for magnesium toxicity) readily available, along with resuscitation equipment."
    },
    "e": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "The therapeutic serum magnesium range for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia is 4-7 mEq/L (4.8-8.4 mg/dL). A level of 10.5 mEq/L is significantly elevated and falls within the toxic range. At this concentration, loss of deep tendon reflexes is expected (typically occurs at 7-10 mEq/L), and the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and cardiac arrest is extremely high (occurs >10-12 mEq/L). Notify the provider immediately.",
      "rationale": "Elevated magnesium levels disrupt normal cellular function, particularly in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. The severity of symptoms correlates with the degree of elevation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Draw serum magnesium levels as prescribed and monitor trends. Be prepared to administer calcium gluconate if toxicity is suspected."
    },
    "f": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Magnesium sulfate is a potent peripheral vasodilator. The sensation of warmth and flushing is a direct result of this vasodilation, which increases cutaneous blood flow. This is a common, expected, and typically transient side effect, especially during the administration of the initial loading dose. It does not indicate that serum magnesium levels have reached a toxic threshold. Reassure the client that this is a normal side effect.",
      "rationale": "Vasodilation occurs because magnesium relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessel walls. This is a benign side effect and does not indicate toxicity.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Inform the client about the possibility of feeling warm and flushed. Provide a cool cloth to enhance comfort."
    }
  },
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the signs of magnesium toxicity with the signs of worsening preeclampsia (i.e., eclampsia). Seizure activity (option B) is a sign of subtherapeutic magnesium levels or disease progression, NOT toxicity. Another common pitfall is misidentifying an expected side effect, such as feeling flushed (option F), as a toxic manifestation. The nurse must differentiate between expected effects, adverse effects, and life-threatening toxicity.",
  "mnemonics": "To recall the signs of magnesium toxicity, use the mnemonic **'BURP'**: **B**lood pressure decreased (hypotension from vasodilation), **U**rine output decreased (<30 mL/hr), **R**espiratory rate decreased (<12 breaths/min), **P**atellar reflex absent (areflexia). Remember that the antidote for magnesium toxicity is **Calcium Gluconate**.",
