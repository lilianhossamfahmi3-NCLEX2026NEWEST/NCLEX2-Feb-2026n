            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Magnesium ions act as a physiologic calcium channel blocker at the neuromuscular junction. At toxic levels, an excess of magnesium competitively inhibits calcium influx into presynaptic nerve terminals, which is essential for the release of acetylcholine. The resulting deficit of acetylcholine at the motor endplate leads to decreased muscle cell depolarization, causing profound muscle weakness that manifests initially as hyporeflexia and progresses to areflexia (absent deep tendon reflexes)."

            "content": "Tonic-clonic seizures are the defining characteristic of eclampsia, the severe progression of preeclampsia that magnesium sulfate is administered to prevent. Magnesium sulfate raises the seizure threshold by acting as a CNS depressant. Therefore, seizure activity indicates a subtherapeutic magnesium level or disease progression, not magnesium toxicity."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Magnesium is cleared from the body almost exclusively by renal excretion. Severe preeclampsia can cause renal vasoconstriction and glomerular endotheliosis, reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A urine output of 20 mL/hour (oliguria) signals impaired renal function. This impairment prevents the excretion of magnesium, causing it to accumulate rapidly in the bloodstream and leading to toxicity. This creates a dangerous positive feedback loop where toxicity worsens as renal clearance fails."

        "d": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Magnesium toxicity causes profound central nervous system depression. At high serum concentrations, magnesium directly suppresses the respiratory control center in the medulla oblongata. Concurrently, the neuromuscular blockade effect weakens the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. This dual mechanism leads to a decreased respiratory rate (bradypnea) and shallow breathing, which can progress to respiratory arrest."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "The therapeutic serum magnesium range for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia is 4-7 mEq/L (4.8-8.4 mg/dL). A level of 10.5 mEq/L is significantly elevated and falls within the toxic range. At this concentration, loss of deep tendon reflexes is expected (typically occurs at 7-10 mEq/L), and the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and cardiac arrest is extremely high (occurs >10-12 mEq/L)."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Magnesium sulfate is a potent peripheral vasodilator. The sensation of warmth and flushing is a direct result of this vasodilation, which increases cutaneous blood flow. This is a common, expected, and typically transient side effect, especially during the administration of the initial loading dose. It does not indicate that serum magnesium levels have reached a toxic threshold."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the signs of magnesium toxicity with the signs of worsening preeclampsia (i.e., eclampsia). Seizure activity (option B) is a sign of subtherapeutic magnesium levels or disease progression, NOT toxicity. Another common pitfall is misidentifying an expected side effect, such as feeling flushed (option F), as a toxic manifestation. The nurse must differentiate between expected effects, adverse effects, and life-threatening toxicity.",
    "mnemonics": "To recall the signs of magnesium toxicity, use the mnemonic **'BURP'**: **B**lood pressure decreased (hypotension from vasodilation), **U**rine output decreased (<30 mL/hr), **R**espiratory rate decreased (<12 breaths/min), **P**atellar reflex absent (areflexia). Remember that the antidote for magnesium toxicity is **Calcium Gluconate**.",
