            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. ARDS causes non-uniform, diffuse alveolar damage, creating a smaller, functional lung (the 'baby lung'). Using standard tidal volumes (10-12 mL/kg) would over-distend and injure these healthier, more compliant lung regions. This overstretching, termed volutrauma, tears the alveolar-capillary membrane, worsens edema, and triggers a systemic inflammatory response (biotrauma). The ARDSNet protocol established that a low tidal volume of 4-6 mL/kg based on *predicted* (not actual) body weight significantly reduces mortality by minimizing this ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. High peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) are a warning sign of excessive pressure in the ventilator circuit, which can be caused by airway resistance or low lung compliance. The primary goal is to keep plateau pressure (Pplat), a measure of alveolar distention, below 30 cm H2O to prevent barotrauma—the rupture of alveoli leading to pneumothorax. Allowing high pressures contradicts the core principle of minimizing lung stress and strain."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. In ARDS, inflammatory exudate and loss of surfactant lead to widespread alveolar collapse (atelectasis), especially at the end of expiration. This cyclical opening and closing of alveoli with each breath creates shear stress, known as atelectrauma, which perpetuates lung injury. PEEP provides constant pressure to stent the alveoli open throughout the respiratory cycle. This 'recruits' collapsed alveoli, increases functional residual capacity (FRC), improves ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching, and enhances oxygenation, allowing for a reduction in FiO2 to non-toxic levels (<0.60)."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This action is contraindicated. To achieve a low PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) would require a high minute ventilation (high respiratory rate and/or high tidal volume), which directly opposes the lung-protective strategy. In ARDS, a strategy of 'permissive hypercapnia' is often employed. This involves accepting a higher-than-normal PaCO2 and the resultant mild respiratory acidosis (pH >7.25) as a necessary consequence of using lung-protective low tidal volumes. The priority is preventing VILI, not normalizing CO2."

        "e": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. This is a key component of the ABCDEF bundle for ICU care. Prolonged deep sedation increases the duration of mechanical ventilation, which in turn increases the risk of ventilator-associated events (VAEs) like pneumonia (VAP). A daily, coordinated 'sedation vacation' (Spontaneous Awakening Trial) lightens sedation to assess neurological function and allows for a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT). This process facilitates earlier liberation from the ventilator, reducing exposure to VILI and other ventilator-related complications."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. Prone positioning is a proven mortality-reducing intervention for moderate-to-severe ARDS. In the supine position, the weight of the heart and the edematous lung tissue compresses the dorsal (posterior) lung regions, causing atelectasis. Prone positioning reverses this gravitational effect, offloads the dorsal lung regions allowing them to re-expand (recruit), improves drainage of secretions, and creates more uniform ventilation relative to perfusion (improved V/Q matching). This leads to significant improvement in oxygenation and reduces VILI."

    "elaboration": {
        "questionTrap": "The primary trap is applying ventilation goals from other clinical contexts to ARDS. For example, aggressively normalizing PaCO2 is a goal in some neurological emergencies but is directly harmful in ARDS as it requires injurious ventilator settings. Lung-protective ventilation prioritizes minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) over achieving 'normal' blood gas values, accepting 'permissive hypercapnia' and lower oxygen saturation goals (88-95%) as part of the protective strategy.",
