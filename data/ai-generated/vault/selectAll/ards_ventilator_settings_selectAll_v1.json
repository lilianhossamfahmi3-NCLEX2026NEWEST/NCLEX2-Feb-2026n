    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. ARDS causes non-uniform, diffuse alveolar damage, creating a smaller, functional lung (the 'baby lung'). Using standard tidal volumes (10-12 mL/kg) would over-distend and injure these healthier, more compliant lung regions. This overstretching, termed volutrauma, tears the alveolar-capillary membrane, worsens edema, and triggers a systemic inflammatory response (biotrauma). The ARDSNet protocol established that a low tidal volume of 4-6 mL/kg based on *predicted* (not actual) body weight significantly reduces mortality by minimizing this ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The rationale behind using predicted body weight is to normalize tidal volume to lung size, regardless of the patient's actual weight.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Low tidal volume ventilation is a cornerstone of ARDS management. Always calculate tidal volume based on predicted body weight, not actual weight. Monitor plateau pressure closely to ensure it remains below 30 cm H2O."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. High peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) are a warning sign of excessive pressure in the ventilator circuit, which can be caused by airway resistance or low lung compliance. The primary goal is to keep plateau pressure (Pplat), a measure of alveolar distention, below 30 cm H2O to prevent barotrauma—the rupture of alveoli leading to pneumothorax. Allowing high pressures contradicts the core principle of minimizing lung stress and strain. Elevated PIP can lead to alveolar rupture and air leak syndromes (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema).",
      "clinicalPearl": "High PIP is an alarm trigger that requires immediate investigation. Assess for causes like bronchospasm, mucus plugging, or decreased lung compliance. Plateau pressure is a more accurate reflection of alveolar pressure than PIP."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. In ARDS, inflammatory exudate and loss of surfactant lead to widespread alveolar collapse (atelectasis), especially at the end of expiration. This cyclical opening and closing of alveoli with each breath creates shear stress, known as atelectrauma, which perpetuates lung injury. PEEP provides constant pressure to stent the alveoli open throughout the respiratory cycle. This 'recruits' collapsed alveoli, increases functional residual capacity (FRC), improves ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching, and enhances oxygenation, allowing for a reduction in FiO2 to non-toxic levels (<0.60). PEEP increases the pressure gradient for oxygen diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane.",
      "clinicalPearl": "PEEP is titrated to achieve optimal oxygenation while avoiding overdistension. Monitor for signs of barotrauma (e.g., pneumothorax) and decreased cardiac output (due to increased intrathoracic pressure)."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is contraindicated. To achieve a low PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) would require a high minute ventilation (high respiratory rate and/or high tidal volume), which directly opposes the lung-protective strategy. In ARDS, a strategy of 'permissive hypercapnia' is often employed. This involves accepting a higher-than-normal PaCO2 and the resultant mild respiratory acidosis (pH >7.25) as a necessary consequence of using lung-protective low tidal volumes. The priority is preventing VILI, not normalizing CO2. The body's buffering systems can usually compensate for mild hypercapnia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Permissive hypercapnia is a deliberate strategy to minimize lung injury. Ensure the pH remains above 7.25. If pH falls below this level, interventions to improve ventilation may be necessary, but always prioritize lung protection."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. This is a key component of the ABCDEF bundle for ICU care. Prolonged deep sedation increases the duration of mechanical ventilation, which in turn increases the risk of ventilator-associated events (VAEs) like pneumonia (VAP). A daily, coordinated 'sedation vacation' (Spontaneous Awakening Trial) lightens sedation to assess neurological function and allows for a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT). This process facilitates earlier liberation from the ventilator, reducing exposure to VILI and other ventilator-related complications. Reducing sedation allows patients to participate more actively in their care and reduces the risk of delirium.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Coordinate sedation vacations with the interdisciplinary team. Monitor the patient closely for signs of distress or agitation during the awakening trial. Have a plan in place to resume sedation if needed."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Prone positioning is a proven mortality-reducing intervention for moderate-to-severe ARDS. In the supine position, the weight of the heart and the edematous lung tissue compresses the dorsal (posterior) lung regions, causing atelectasis. Prone positioning reverses this gravitational effect, offloads the dorsal lung regions allowing them to re-expand (recruit), improves drainage of secretions, and creates more uniform ventilation relative to perfusion (improved V/Q matching). This leads to significant improvement in oxygenation and reduces VILI. Prone positioning also reduces the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury by promoting more homogenous lung inflation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Prone positioning requires a dedicated team and careful planning. Monitor the patient closely for complications such as pressure ulcers, dislodgement of lines, and facial edema. Ensure the airway is secure and accessible."
    }
  },
  "elaboration": {
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is applying ventilation goals from other clinical contexts to ARDS. For example, aggressively normalizing PaCO2 is a goal in some neurological emergencies but is directly harmful in ARDS as it requires injurious ventilator settings. Lung-protective ventilation prioritizes minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) over achieving 'normal' blood gas values, accepting 'permissive hypercapnia' and lower oxygen saturation goals (88-95%) as part of the protective strategy.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the 'LUNG-SAFE' mnemonic for ARDS protective strategies:\nL: Low Tidal Volume (4-6 mL/kg PBW)\nU: Use PEEP (to recruit alveoli)\nN: Neuromuscular Blockade (for severe cases, to prevent dyssynchrony)\nG: Goals: Pplat < 30 cm H2O, Driving Pressure < 15 cm H2O\n\nS: Sedation Vacation (part of ABCDEF bundle)\nA: Accept Permissive Hypercapnia\nF: Fluid Conservative Strategy\nE: Early Prone Positioning (for moderate-severe ARDS)"

    "situation": "The client is a 62-year-old male admitted with ARDS secondary to pneumonia, intubated and mechanically ventilated.",
    "background": "The client was intubated on 0800 due to worsening respiratory distress. Initial ventilator settings were: FiO2 60%, TV 500 mL, RR 20, PEEP 5 cm H2O. Current ABG (1000): pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L, SaO2 88%.",
    "assessment": "The client's oxygen saturation remains low despite increased FiO2. Peak inspiratory pressures are trending upwards. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. The client is currently sedated with propofol.",
    "recommendation": "I recommend increasing the PEEP to improve oxygenation, considering prone positioning to improve V/Q matching, and continuing with lung-protective ventilation strategies. A sedation vacation should be considered to assess neurological status and readiness for weaning, while closely monitoring for ventilator-associated events. Consider neuromuscular blockade if patient-ventilator asynchrony persists despite sedation adjustments."
