For example, aggressively normalizing PaCO2 is a goal in some neurological emergencies but is directly harmful in ARDS as it requires injurious ventilator settings. Lung-protective ventilation prioritizes minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) over achieving 'normal' blood gas values, accepting 'permissive hypercapnia' and lower oxygen saturation goals (88-95%) as part of the protective strategy.",

        "sbar": "Situation: The client is a 62-year-old male admitted with ARDS secondary to pneumonia, intubated and mechanically ventilated.\nBackground: The client was intubated on 0800 due to worsening respiratory distress. Initial ventilator settings were: FiO2 60%, TV 500 mL, RR 20, PEEP 5 cm H2O. Current ABG (1000): pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L, SaO2 88%.\nAssessment: The client's oxygen saturation remains low despite increased FiO2. Peak inspiratory pressures are trending upwards. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. The client is currently sedated with propofol.\nRecommendation: I recommend increasing the PEEP to improve oxygenation, considering prone positioning to improve V/Q matching, and continuing with lung-protective ventilation strategies. A sedation vacation should be considered to assess neurological status and readiness for weaning, while closely monitoring for ventilator-associated events. Consider neuromuscular blockade if patient-ventilator asynchrony persists despite sedation adjustments."
