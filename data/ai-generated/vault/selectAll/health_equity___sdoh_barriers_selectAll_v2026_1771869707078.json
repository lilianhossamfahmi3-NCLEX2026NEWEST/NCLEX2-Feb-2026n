        "text": "Ms. Vance lives in a rural area with limited public transportation options.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Living in a rural area with limited transportation is a significant SDOH barrier. It restricts access to healthcare facilities, specialists, and follow-up appointments, impacting treatment adherence and overall health outcomes. Transportation insecurity directly affects the ability to attend medical appointments, pick up prescriptions, and participate in preventive care."

      {
        "id": "optB",
        "text": "Ms. Vance has a stable income and comprehensive health insurance coverage.",
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Stable income and comprehensive health insurance typically facilitate access to healthcare, rather than acting as a barrier. These factors allow for easier management of healthcare costs and greater choice of providers and services. This option directly contrasts with the challenges posed by financial insecurity and lack of insurance."

        "text": "Ms. Vance reports feeling isolated and has limited social support networks.",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Social isolation and limited support networks are crucial SDOH factors. Lack of social support can lead to decreased mental and physical health, impacting the patient's ability to manage their health conditions and adhere to treatment plans. Social connections provide emotional support, practical assistance, and encouragement, all of which are vital for health maintenance."

        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "High health literacy is a positive factor that enhances the patient's ability to navigate the healthcare system and adhere to medical advice. Individuals with strong health literacy are better equipped to understand medical information, make informed decisions, and manage their health conditions effectively. This is the opposite of a barrier."

        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Living in a food desert severely limits access to nutritious food, impacting diet and overall health. Food insecurity and poor nutrition can exacerbate existing health conditions and lead to new health problems, hindering effective disease management and preventive care. Access to healthy food is a fundamental SDOH that influences health outcomes significantly."

        "text": "Ms. Vance actively participates in community health programs and support groups.",

        "rationale": "Active participation in community health programs indicates engagement with resources that promote health and well-being, suggesting access to and utilization of support systems. This is the opposite of a barrier; it demonstrates proactive involvement in health management. Such participation often leads to improved health outcomes and better adherence to treatment plans."

      "background": "Patient lives alone in a rural area, approximately 45 minutes from the nearest hospital. Limited access to public transportation; relies on infrequent rides from neighbors. States she often skips meals due to difficulty obtaining groceries. Expresses feelings of loneliness and isolation since her husband passed away two years ago. Has Medicare but struggles with copays.",
      "assessment": "BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Lower extremity edema +3 bilaterally. Labs pending. Patient appears anxious and reports difficulty understanding her medication regimen. States, 'I just can't seem to get to the doctor when I need to, and the food around here is terrible.'",
      "recommendation": "Assess social determinants of health impacting access to care and adherence. Consult social worker to address transportation, food insecurity, and social isolation. Initiate patient education on medication management and lifestyle modifications. Consider home health referral for ongoing monitoring and support. Advocate for affordable medication options and explore community resources."

      "correct": "This question assesses the nurse's ability to identify social determinants of health (SDOH) that act as barriers to healthcare access and adherence. SDOH are conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. The correct options highlight common SDOH barriers such as rural residence with limited transportation, social isolation, and food insecurity. Recognizing these barriers is crucial for developing patient-centered care plans that address the underlying factors impacting health outcomes. Failure to address SDOH can lead to poor adherence, increased hospital readmissions, and disparities in health outcomes.",
