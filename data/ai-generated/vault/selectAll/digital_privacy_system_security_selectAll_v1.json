        "correct": "Workstation security is a major focus of 2026 HIPAA updates. (A) Manual log-off is required to prevent unauthorized access if automatic timers fail. This prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing patient data, ensuring confidentiality and compliance with HIPAA regulations. (B) Physical positioning prevents 'shoulder surfing' by the public. This safeguards sensitive patient information from being viewed by unauthorized individuals in the vicinity. (D) Privacy filters are mandatory for mobile devices that may be used in public view. These filters restrict the viewing angle, preventing unauthorized individuals from seeing the screen's content. (F) Security awareness includes reporting physical breaches (tailgating) that could lead to unauthorized system access. This helps maintain the physical security of the facility and prevents unauthorized access to computer systems.",
        "incorrect": "(C) Passwords must *never* be shared, even in emergencies; most systems have 'emergency access' or 'break glass' protocols that do not require password sharing. Sharing passwords compromises security and accountability, violating HIPAA regulations. (E) Closing a browser tab does not always terminate the session; always use the formal 'Log Out' or 'Sign Out' command. Failing to log out properly leaves the system vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches.",

Current observations indicate potential risks due to the shared workstation environment.\nRecommendation: The nurse should immediately log off after each use, position monitors to prevent unauthorized viewing, utilize privacy screens on mobile devices, and promptly report any security breaches or suspicious activities, such as tailgating, to security personnel."
