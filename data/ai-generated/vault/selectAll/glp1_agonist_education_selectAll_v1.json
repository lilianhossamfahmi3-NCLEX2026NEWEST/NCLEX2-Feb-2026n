    "answerBreakdown": {
        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is correct. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system, including brain regions that regulate mood and reward pathways (e.g., hypothalamus, brainstem). Altering GLP-1 signaling can modulate neurotransmitter systems, creating a potential risk for neuropsychiatric adverse events. Suicidal ideation is a specifically monitored serious adverse effect for this drug class, requiring immediate reporting to prevent self-harm."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide involve strong binding to albumin, which protects it from rapid degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This mechanism extends its half-life to approximately 7 days, allowing for once-weekly administration. Instructing a client to inject it daily would lead to drug accumulation and a supratherapeutic dose, drastically increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia and intolerable gastrointestinal side effects."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is correct. GLP-1 agonists exert their effects by slowing gastric emptying and acting on hypothalamic centers to increase satiety. The delayed movement of food from the stomach is a primary driver of nausea and a feeling of fullness, which contributes to decreased appetite. These effects are most pronounced during the initial dose-titration phase and typically diminish as the client's body physiologically adapts to the medication."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is correct. Severe, persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to the back, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis, a rare but life-threatening complication of GLP-1 agonist therapy. The proposed mechanism involves pancreatic ductal stimulation, which can lead to inflammation and premature activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas, causing autodigestion. This requires immediate medical evaluation, including serum lipase and amylase levels, to prevent progression to pancreatic necrosis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is incorrect. A single episode of vomiting is an expected, common side effect related to delayed gastric emptying, not an indication to stop therapy. Abruptly discontinuing a key antihyperglycemic agent without medical guidance can cause rebound hyperglycemia and loss of glycemic control. The appropriate instruction is to manage mild symptoms (e.g., eat smaller meals) and to contact the provider if vomiting is severe or persistent, which may necessitate a dose adjustment, not immediate cessation."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is correct. All medications administered via subcutaneous injection require site rotation. Repeated injections into the same localized area of adipose tissue can cause lipohypertrophy, a thickening of the subcutaneous fat. This altered tissue integrity impairs the drug's absorption kinetics, leading to erratic blood glucose levels and inconsistent therapeutic effects. Rotating sites ensures consistent absorption from healthy tissue."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap involves differentiating between expected, manageable side effects (mild nausea) and symptoms of a life-threatening complication (severe abdominal pain). A secondary trap is the dosing frequency; test-takers must know that while some older GLP-1 agonists are daily (liraglutide), the newer and more common agents like semaglutide are administered weekly due to their extended pharmacokinetic profile.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the mnemonic 'PANCREAS' for GLP-1 agonist key teaching points:\n- P: Pancreatitis risk (report severe abdominal pain).\n- A: Appetite suppression (nausea/fullness is expected).\n- N: Not for daily use (most are weekly, e.g., semaglutide).\n- C: CNS effects (report depression/suicidal thoughts).\n- R: Rotate injection sites (prevents lipohypertrophy).\n- E: Endocrine function (improves glycemic control).\n- A: Avoid abrupt cessation (consult provider for side effects).\n- S: Subcutaneous injection technique is vital."
