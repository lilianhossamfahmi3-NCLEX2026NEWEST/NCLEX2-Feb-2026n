    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "This is correct. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system, including brain regions that regulate mood and reward pathways (e.g., hypothalamus, brainstem). GLP-1 agonists can modulate neurotransmitter systems, potentially leading to neuropsychiatric adverse events. Suicidal ideation is a serious adverse effect requiring immediate reporting to prevent self-harm. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it may involve alterations in dopamine and serotonin signaling.",
      "content": "This is correct. Report any new or worsening depression or suicidal thoughts immediately."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is incorrect. Semaglutide's pharmacokinetics involve strong binding to albumin, protecting it from rapid degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This extends its half-life to approximately 7 days, allowing for once-weekly administration. Daily injections would lead to drug accumulation and a supratherapeutic dose, increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia and intolerable gastrointestinal side effects. Other GLP-1 agonists like liraglutide are administered daily, so it is important to know the specific drug.",
      "content": "This is incorrect. The medication is typically administered once weekly, not daily."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "This is correct. GLP-1 agonists slow gastric emptying and act on hypothalamic centers to increase satiety. Delayed gastric emptying is a primary driver of nausea and fullness, contributing to decreased appetite. These effects are most pronounced during the initial dose-titration phase and typically diminish as the body adapts to the medication. The GLP-1 receptor activation in the stomach reduces peristalsis, leading to the sensation of fullness and nausea.",
      "content": "This is correct. Expect mild nausea and decreased appetite during the first few weeks."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "This is correct. Severe, persistent abdominal pain, possibly radiating to the back, is a hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis, a rare but life-threatening complication of GLP-1 agonist therapy. The proposed mechanism involves pancreatic ductal stimulation, leading to inflammation and premature activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas, causing autodigestion. This requires immediate medical evaluation, including serum lipase and amylase levels, to prevent progression to pancreatic necrosis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The inflammation can also cause edema and ischemia within the pancreas.",
      "content": "This is correct. Contact the healthcare provider for severe, persistent abdominal pain."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is incorrect. A single episode of vomiting is an expected, common side effect related to delayed gastric emptying, not an indication to stop therapy. Abruptly discontinuing a key antihyperglycemic agent without medical guidance can cause rebound hyperglycemia and loss of glycemic control. Manage mild symptoms (e.g., eat smaller meals) and contact the provider if vomiting is severe or persistent, which may necessitate a dose adjustment, not immediate cessation. The vomiting is a result of the delayed gastric emptying and increased gastric distension.",
      "content": "This is incorrect. Do not discontinue the medication for a single episode of vomiting. Contact the provider for persistent vomiting."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "This is correct. All medications administered via subcutaneous injection require site rotation. Repeated injections into the same localized area of adipose tissue can cause lipohypertrophy, a thickening of the subcutaneous fat. This altered tissue integrity impairs the drug's absorption kinetics, leading to erratic blood glucose levels and inconsistent therapeutic effects. Rotating sites ensures consistent absorption from healthy tissue. Lipohypertrophy occurs due to the local anabolic effects of insulin and other growth factors stimulated by repeated injections.",
      "content": "This is correct. Rotate the injection site among the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm."
    }
  },
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap involves differentiating between expected, manageable side effects (mild nausea) and symptoms of a life-threatening complication (severe abdominal pain). A secondary trap is the dosing frequency; test-takers must know that while some older GLP-1 agonists are daily (liraglutide), the newer and more common agents like semaglutide are administered weekly due to their extended pharmacokinetic profile.",
  "mnemonics": "Use the mnemonic 'PANCREAS' for GLP-1 agonist key teaching points:\n- P: Pancreatitis risk (report severe abdominal pain).\n- A: Appetite suppression (nausea/fullness is expected).\n- N: Not for daily use (most are weekly, e.g., semaglutide).\n- C: CNS effects (report depression/suicidal thoughts).\n- R: Rotate injection sites (prevents lipohypertrophy).\n- E: Endocrine function (improves glycemic control).\n- A: Avoid abrupt cessation (consult provider for side effects).\n- S: Subcutaneous injection technique is vital.",

    "situation": "At 1400, the client is starting a GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g., semaglutide) for type 2 diabetes and weight management.",
    "background": "The client has type 2 diabetes and is prescribed a GLP-1 receptor agonist to improve glycemic control and/or promote weight loss. Understanding of medication administration and potential side effects is crucial for adherence and safety. The client's current medications and medical history have been reviewed.",
    "assessment": "The client needs education on administration technique, expected side effects, and potential complications of GLP-1 receptor agonists. The client's baseline understanding of diabetes management has been assessed.",
    "recommendation": "Provide comprehensive education on GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, including administration, side effect management, and when to contact the healthcare provider. Schedule a follow-up appointment to assess the client's response to the medication and address any concerns."
