He reports decreased urine output over the past 24 hours. 14:02 - B: Patient's baseline creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL. He was started on IV fluids yesterday for dehydration. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. 14:04 - A: Patient is currently alert and oriented, but complaining of muscle weakness and nausea. Current vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 37.5°C. ECG shows peaked T waves. Serum potassium is 6.8 mEq/L. Sodium is 140 mEq/L. BUN is 45 mg/dL, and creatinine is 3.5 mg/dL. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. 14:06 - R: I am concerned about the patient's hyperkalemia and its potential cardiac effects. I recommend immediate interventions to lower potassium levels, including calcium gluconate for cardiac stabilization, insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly, and possibly sodium polystyrene sulfonate to remove potassium from the body. Consider holding lisinopril. A repeat potassium level should be obtained in 1-2 hours. Monitor urine output closely, and consider the need for dialysis if hyperkalemia is refractory to medical management.",
