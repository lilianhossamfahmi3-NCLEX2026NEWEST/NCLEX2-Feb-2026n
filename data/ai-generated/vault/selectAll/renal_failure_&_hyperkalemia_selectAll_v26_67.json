This is an appropriate intervention if the client has adequate kidney function (or some residual function) to respond to the diuretic.

While fluid overload can contribute to electrolyte imbalances, the immediate priority is to lower potassium levels, not to restrict fluids unless there's a clear indication of fluid overload unrelated to the hyperkalemia. Fluid restriction can exacerbate AKI."
