It directly confronts the discriminatory behavior without escalating the emotional tone. Legally, this aligns with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects employees from discrimination. By citing policy, the charge nurse depersonalizes the conflict and reinforces that professional standards, not personal biases, govern care assignments."

Ethically, it inflicts moral injury on the targeted nurse by signaling that their professional value is contingent upon a client's prejudice. This undermines team cohesion and the principle of justice within the healthcare setting."
