    "stem": "You are caring for a 68-year-old male patient, Mr. Johnson, status post Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation three days ago. Review the provided patient information and identify the findings that require immediate intervention.",
    "sbar": {
      "situation": "Mr. Johnson is a 68-year-old male, post-operative day 3 from LVAD implantation. He's been relatively stable, but over the last hour, there have been some changes.",
      "background": "He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF of 15% prior to LVAD. The LVAD is set to a fixed rate. Post-op course was initially uncomplicated. Anticoagulation was initiated per protocol. Baseline labs and vitals were within expected post-operative ranges. He is on telemetry monitoring.",
      "assessment": "At 1400, the patient's MAP has decreased from an average of 80 mmHg to 65 mmHg. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. The patient is reporting dizziness. On auscultation, heart sounds are distant, and a new murmur is auscultated. Neurological assessment reveals the patient is oriented to person and place but is now confused about the time. Lab values show an elevated Lactate of 3.5 mmol/L.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend immediate assessment for potential LVAD malfunction, internal bleeding, or pump thrombosis. STAT labs, including CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, and lactate, are needed. Notify the surgeon immediately and prepare for potential interventions, including fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, or surgical exploration. Consider a STAT echocardiogram to assess LVAD function and rule out tamponade. Assess pump parameters via the LVAD controller."
