    "correct": "Assessing the high pressure alarm setting is crucial because it alerts to possible airway obstruction, such as mucus plugging or kinked tubing, which can cause respiratory distress. Evaluating the tidal volume setting is important as inadequate tidal volume can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory distress. Checking the FiO2 setting is essential to ensure adequate oxygenation and rule out hypoxemia as a cause of distress. Changes in oxygen requirements should be addressed immediately to prevent further decompensation.",
    "incorrect": "While the respiratory rate setting is important, it is less immediately critical than airway obstruction or oxygenation issues. While the PEEP setting is important, sudden changes in respiratory distress are less likely related to PEEP than to acute obstruction or oxygenation issues. Although the low exhaled volume alarm can indicate a leak in the system, it's less immediately life-threatening than airway obstruction, inadequate tidal volume, or hypoxemia. Addressing these factors is vital before assessing for leaks.",
