He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and a HeartMate II LVAD implanted 3 years ago. \n\n0605: Neuro assessment reveals GCS of 11 (E3, V3, M5), pupils are equal and sluggishly reactive. Right-sided weakness is noted. ICP is trending upwards, currently at 22 mmHg. MAP is 95 mmHg. LVAD parameters: flow 5.2 L/min, speed 9000 RPM, PI 6.0. Patient is on continuous EEG monitoring. \n\n0610: Current orders include mannitol 25g IV q4h, continuous hypertonic saline infusion at 30 mL/hr, and strict head-of-bed elevation to 30 degrees. Recent CT scan shows mild cerebral edema. \n\n0615: I'm concerned about the rising ICP despite current interventions. I recommend consulting neurosurgery for possible further intervention, such as external ventricular drain (EVD) placement. Also, please evaluate the LVAD parameters in the context of increased afterload from the elevated ICP. Consider optimizing MAP to maintain CPP between 60-70 mmHg. I will continue close monitoring of neuro status, ICP, and LVAD function.",
