In LVAD patients, this position also optimizes preload and afterload balance, crucial for LVAD function. This position facilitates cerebral venous outflow, decreasing ICP. Clinical Pearl: Ensure the patient's body is aligned to prevent increased intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede LVAD function."

LVAD patients often require a higher MAP target than general patients due to altered hemodynamics. Vasopressors may be needed to achieve this goal while carefully monitoring LVAD parameters.
