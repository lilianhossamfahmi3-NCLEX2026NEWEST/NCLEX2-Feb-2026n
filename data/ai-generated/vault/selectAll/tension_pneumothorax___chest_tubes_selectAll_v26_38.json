        "text": "Assess the chest tube insertion site for subcutaneous emphysema.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Subcutaneous emphysema indicates air leaking into the subcutaneous tissue, which can occur following chest tube insertion. Prompt assessment and documentation of the extent of subcutaneous emphysema are crucial for monitoring the effectiveness of the chest tube and identifying potential complications. Increased subcutaneous emphysema can indicate a persistent air leak and require further intervention."

        "text": "Maintain the chest tube drainage system below the level of the patient's chest.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Maintaining the chest tube drainage system below the level of the patient's chest facilitates gravity drainage, preventing backflow of fluid or air into the pleural space. This position promotes effective drainage and lung re-expansion. Backflow can cause complications, including infection or a recurrent pneumothorax."

        "id": "optionC",
        "text": "Clamp the chest tube during patient ambulation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Clamping the chest tube during patient ambulation is contraindicated unless specifically prescribed by the provider for brief periods (e.g., changing the drainage system). Routine clamping can lead to a buildup of air or fluid in the pleural space, potentially causing a tension pneumothorax or other complications. The risk outweighs the benefit during ambulation."

        "id": "optionD",
        "text": "Encourage the patient to cough and deep breathe regularly.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Coughing and deep breathing promote lung expansion, mobilize secretions, and prevent atelectasis. These actions aid in the resolution of the pneumothorax and improve overall respiratory function. Deep breathing increases negative pressure in the chest, facilitating air removal through the chest tube."

      {
        "id": "optionE",
        "text": "Milk the chest tube to ensure patency.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Routine milking or stripping of chest tubes is generally not recommended, as it can create excessive negative pressure and damage lung tissue. Gentle manipulation to remove clots is acceptable if prescribed, but forceful milking should be avoided. Studies have shown that aggressive stripping can increase intrathoracic pressure and cause tissue trauma."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Monitoring the drainage provides essential information about the patient's condition. Changes in color, consistency, or amount can indicate complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or continued air leak. Increased bloody drainage may signal bleeding, while purulent drainage indicates infection. Sudden cessation of drainage can suggest a tube obstruction."

Intubated and mechanically ventilated since yesterday. Decreased breath sounds on the right side noted during morning assessment. **Assessment:** Respiratory rate 32, SpO2 88% on FiO2 60%, BP 90/60, HR 120. Tracheal deviation to the left. Increased work of breathing. ABG: pH 7.20, PaCO2 65, PaO2 55. Chest X-ray shows right-sided tension pneumothorax. A 28 French chest tube was inserted at 07:15 in the right mid-axillary line at the 5th intercostal space. Initial drainage was 350 mL of serosanguinous fluid and a significant amount of air. **Recommendation:** Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Assess chest tube function and drainage. Obtain a repeat chest X-ray to evaluate lung re-expansion. Consider adjusting ventilator settings based on ABG results. Provide pain management and sedation as needed. Anticipate potential complications such as infection or persistent air leak.",
