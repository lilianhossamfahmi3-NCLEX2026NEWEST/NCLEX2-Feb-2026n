            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Subcutaneous emphysema occurs when air leaks into the subcutaneous tissue around the insertion site. This can indicate a malpositioned chest tube or a leak at the insertion site. Prompt assessment and documentation are crucial to monitor the extent and progression. Increasing subcutaneous emphysema may require repositioning or further intervention to ensure proper chest tube function. Palpate around the insertion site and surrounding tissues to identify any crepitus, which is the crackling sensation caused by air under the skin. Document the location and size of the affected area."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Maintaining the chest tube drainage system below the level of the patient's chest promotes gravity drainage, preventing backflow of fluid or air into the pleural space. This position ensures effective drainage and facilitates lung re-expansion. Backflow can lead to complications, including infection or recurrent pneumothorax. Ensure the drainage system is stable and secure to prevent accidental tipping or spills, which could compromise the system's integrity and patient safety."

            "rationale": "Clamping the chest tube during patient ambulation is contraindicated unless specifically prescribed by the provider for brief periods (e.g., changing the drainage system). Routine clamping can lead to a buildup of air or fluid in the pleural space, potentially causing a tension pneumothorax or other complications. The risk outweighs the benefit during ambulation. If the chest tube must be disconnected briefly, use padded clamps and monitor the patient closely for any signs of respiratory distress."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Coughing and deep breathing promote lung expansion, mobilize secretions, and prevent atelectasis. These actions aid in the resolution of the pneumothorax and improve overall respiratory function. Deep breathing increases negative pressure in the chest, facilitating air removal through the chest tube. Splinting the chest tube insertion site with a pillow during coughing can reduce pain and discomfort, encouraging more effective respiratory effort."

            "rationale": "Routine milking or stripping of chest tubes is generally not recommended, as it can create excessive negative pressure and damage lung tissue. Gentle manipulation to remove clots is acceptable if prescribed, but forceful milking should be avoided. Studies have shown that aggressive stripping can increase intrathoracic pressure and cause tissue trauma. If clots are suspected, gently squeeze and release the tube, avoiding excessive force, and consult with the provider if patency cannot be restored."

            "rationale": "Monitoring the drainage provides essential information about the patient's condition. Changes in color, consistency, or amount can indicate complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or continued air leak. Increased bloody drainage may signal bleeding, while purulent drainage indicates infection. Sudden cessation of drainage can suggest a tube obstruction. Document the characteristics of the drainage at least every shift and more frequently if significant changes occur. Report any concerning findings to the provider promptly."

Increased work of breathing. ABG: pH 7.20, PaCO2 65 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg. Chest X-ray shows right-sided tension pneumothorax. A 28 French chest tube was inserted at 07:15 in the right mid-axillary line at the 5th intercostal space. Initial drainage was 350 mL of serosanguinous fluid and significant air. **Recommendation:** Monitor respiratory status closely. Assess chest tube function and drainage. Obtain a repeat chest X-ray to evaluate lung re-expansion. Adjust ventilator settings based on ABG results. Provide pain management and sedation as needed.
