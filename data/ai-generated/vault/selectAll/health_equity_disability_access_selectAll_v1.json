Simply increasing the amplitude (loudness) of the sound does not correct this physiological deficit and can distort the sound, making lip-reading more difficult. This action can also be perceived as condescending, which damages the therapeutic alliance."

A qualified interpreter is fluent in both ASL and medical terminology, ensuring precise transmission of complex information for informed consent, medication reconciliation, and discharge teaching. This prevents errors originating from misunderstanding dosages, side effects, or treatment plans."

The family member lacks training in medical terminology, may be emotionally biased, and might unintentionally edit, omit, or soften critical information. This introduces a dangerous and unreliable variable into the communication pathway, compromising the integrity of the health assessment and the client's autonomy."

This significantly increases the risk of an unaddressed emergency, such as a fall, acute pain, or dyspnea. A visual (flashing light) or tactile (vibrating) signal closes this sensory feedback loop, confirming to the client that staff has been alerted, thereby maintaining a safe environment."

Documenting the communication plan in a highly visible area of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), such as a header or alert, is a critical systems-level safety measure. This prevents communication handoff failures between shifts and disciplines. It ensures every member of the care team is immediately aware of the need for an ASL interpreter or other aids, preventing delays in care and reducing the risk of providers attempting to communicate without proper resources."

Assuming a one-size-fits-all approach is unsafe. The client may require additional aids like a videophone to communicate with family, a whiteboard for simple requests, or closed captioning. Asking directly respects the client's autonomy and ensures all necessary tools are in place to facilitate full participation in their care, which is a cornerstone of health equity."
