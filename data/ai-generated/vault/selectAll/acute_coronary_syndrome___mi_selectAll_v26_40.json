    "correct": "Administering oxygen is crucial to increase oxygen supply to the ischemic myocardium, reducing further damage. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation and reducing the risk of vessel occlusion. Nitroglycerin dilates blood vessels, reducing preload and afterload, thus decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and relieving chest pain. The patient's current vital signs and ECG findings support the need for these interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Morphine may mask pain symptoms but offers minimal benefit in reperfusion and can cause respiratory depression. Fluid boluses can worsen pulmonary edema in the presence of heart failure and increased cardiac workload, which is a risk in MI. A beta-blocker is appropriate but typically not in the acute phase, especially with hypotension, as it can further decrease blood pressure and cardiac output. The patient's current BP of 90/60 is a contraindication.",
