Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome occurs when the SVC, which carries deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the heart, is obstructed, often by a tumor. This obstruction increases venous hydrostatic pressure in the SVC drainage area. The face and periorbital area have low tissue tension, making them susceptible to edema. Edema is typically worse in the morning due to recumbency overnight, which hinders venous drainage. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Tumor compression of the SVC reduces venous return from the head and neck. Increased hydrostatic pressure forces fluid into interstitial spaces. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for changes in facial edema; rapid increase may indicate worsening SVC obstruction.",

The body attempts to reroute blood flow through smaller veins, resulting in distension of the jugular veins in the neck and superficial veins on the chest wall. This is a compensatory mechanism to bypass the obstruction.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** SVC obstruction leads to increased venous pressure, prompting the development of collateral venous pathways. These pathways become engorged and visible.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Note the location and extent of venous distension; document any new or worsening collateral vein formation.",

Vital signs: BP 140/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air.\nAssessment: Significant facial and periorbital edema noted, especially prominent this morning. Distended neck veins and visible collateral veins on the chest wall. Reports progressive dyspnea and persistent cough. Stridor present. Upper extremities are edematous and reddish in color.\nRecommendation: STAT chest X-ray and CT scan to confirm SVC obstruction. Elevate head of bed to 90 degrees. Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 >92%. Prepare for possible intubation due to stridor and airway compromise. Contact physician immediately to discuss treatment options, including possible radiation therapy or stent placement. Monitor vital signs and respiratory status every 15 minutes. Notify Rapid Response Team if condition deteriorates. Time: 1430."
