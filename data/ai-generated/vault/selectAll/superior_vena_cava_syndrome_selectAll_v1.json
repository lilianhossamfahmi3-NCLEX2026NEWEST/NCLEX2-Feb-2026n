    "answerBreakdown": {
        "a": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The Superior Vena Cava (SVC) drains deoxygenated blood from the head and neck. Obstruction by a tumor increases venous hydrostatic pressure proximal to the blockage. This elevated pressure forces fluid from the intravascular space into the interstitial tissues of the face and periorbital area, which have low tissue tension. The edema is typically most pronounced in the morning after a period of recumbency, as gravity no longer assists with venous drainage from the head."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. As pressure builds within the obstructed SVC, the body attempts to reroute blood flow through smaller, collateral veins. This leads to visible engorgement and distension of the jugular veins in the neck and the superficial veins across the chest wall (e.g., thoracoepigastric veins). This development of collateral circulation is a hallmark sign of chronic or subacute venous obstruction."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Dyspnea and cough can result from two primary mechanisms in this context. The external mass (lung tumor) can directly compress the trachea or bronchi, narrowing the airway. Additionally, the severe venous congestion from SVC obstruction can lead to laryngeal or tracheal edema, further compromising the airway lumen and causing shortness of breath and an irritative cough."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. The SVC drains the upper half of the body. Edema in the ankles and feet indicates increased venous pressure in the lower extremities, which drain into the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). This finding points towards conditions such as right-sided heart failure, IVC obstruction, or cirrhosis, not isolated SVC syndrome."
        },
        "e": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The SVC receives venous return from the upper extremities via the subclavian veins. Compression of the SVC causes blood to back up into these vessels, elevating hydrostatic pressure within the arms and hands. This results in edema (swelling) and plethora (a ruddy, reddish appearance) due to venous engorgement and stasis of deoxygenated blood."
        },
        "f": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Stridor is a high-pitched, inspiratory sound indicating significant upper airway narrowing. In SVC syndrome, it is an ominous, late-stage finding caused by severe laryngeal edema resulting from profound venous congestion. This represents a critical airway compromise and is a life-threatening oncologic emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent respiratory arrest."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between upper and lower body venous congestion. Candidates may incorrectly select 'bilateral 3+ pitting edema in the ankles' because edema is a known oncologic complication, failing to apply the specific anatomical knowledge that the SVC drains the upper body. SVC syndrome signs are confined 'above the diaphragm,' while lower body edema suggests IVC involvement or systemic conditions like heart failure.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the mnemonic 'FACE' to recall the classic signs of SVC Syndrome:\n**F** - Facial edema (especially periorbital), Facial plethora (redness)\n**A** - Arm edema (unilateral or bilateral)\n**C** - Collateral vein formation (distended chest/neck veins)\n**E** - Edema of the neck (JVD), Emergency (stridor, dyspnea)",
