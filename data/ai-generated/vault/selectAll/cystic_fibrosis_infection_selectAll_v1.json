            "content": "Correct. In cystic fibrosis (CF), defective CFTR protein function leads to thick, dehydrated mucus that impairs mucociliary clearance and harbors bacteria like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. An active infection triggers a robust neutrophilic inflammatory response. The breakdown of these neutrophils releases DNA and proteases, which significantly increases sputum viscosity and changes its color to yellow or green (purulence), reflecting a high bacterial and cellular load. An increase in sputum volume is a direct result of this inflammatory exudate."

            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. Coughing is a primary compensatory mechanism to clear the abnormally tenacious mucus from the airways in CF. During a pulmonary exacerbation, the proliferation of pathogens and the subsequent inflammatory cascade lead to increased mucus production and bronchial irritation. This heightened irritation stimulates cough receptors more frequently and intensely, resulting in more prominent and persistent coughing spells as the body attempts to maintain airway patency against an increased obstructive load."

            "optionId": "c",
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. A pulmonary infection initiates a systemic inflammatory response, increasing the child's basal metabolic rate and caloric needs. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), are released, which act on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite (anorexia). Concurrently, the increased work of breathing consumes a significant number of calories. This combination of decreased caloric intake and increased metabolic demand quickly leads to weight loss or a failure to gain weight, a critical indicator of an exacerbation in a population already at risk for malnutrition."

            "content": "Incorrect. Salty-tasting skin is the cardinal, baseline pathophysiological manifestation of CF. It is caused by the defective CFTR protein's inability to reabsorb chloride from sweat in the eccrine ducts. As chloride remains in the sweat, sodium follows its electrochemical gradient, resulting in sweat with a high salt concentration. This is a constant finding used for diagnosis (sweat chloride test) and does not indicate an acute change or the onset of a pulmonary infection."

            "optionId": "e",
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. A pulmonary infection exacerbates airway obstruction through increased mucus plugging, mucosal edema, and bronchospasm. This worsens ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatching, leading to impaired gas exchange and subsequent hypoxemia. The body must expend significantly more energy on the work of breathing to maintain adequate oxygenation. This combination of systemic inflammation, increased respiratory muscle effort, and reduced oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues manifests clinically as profound fatigue and a noticeable decrease in the child's ability to tolerate physical activity."

Wheezing is a high-pitched sound caused by turbulent airflow through narrowed airways, resulting from inflammation, bronchospasm, and mucus plugs. Crackles (rales) are caused by the sudden opening of small airways and alveoli that were previously collapsed by fluid or inflammatory exudate. The onset of these sounds signifies increased airway obstruction and fluid accumulation characteristic of an active infectious process."

Salty-tasting skin is pathognomonic for cystic fibrosis due to the underlying chloride channel defect. Test-takers who simply associate this sign with CF, without considering the stem's focus on 'pulmonary infection', will incorrectly select it. The question requires the nurse to identify *changes* from the child's baseline that signal an acute infectious process, not the static characteristics of the disease itself."
