      "optionId": "a",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. In cystic fibrosis (CF), a mutation in the CFTR gene leads to dysfunctional CFTR protein, resulting in the production of abnormally thick and dehydrated mucus. This thick mucus impairs mucociliary clearance, creating an environment conducive to bacterial colonization, particularly by organisms like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus*. When a pulmonary infection occurs, the body mounts an inflammatory response, characterized by the influx of neutrophils into the airways. These neutrophils release enzymes and DNA upon their breakdown, further increasing the viscosity and purulence (color change to yellow or green) of the sputum. The increased sputum volume is a direct result of the inflammatory exudate and bacterial load.",

    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Coughing is a crucial mechanism for clearing the airways of mucus and debris. In CF, the abnormally thick mucus makes it difficult to clear the airways effectively. A pulmonary infection exacerbates this issue by increasing mucus production and causing inflammation of the bronchial walls. This inflammation stimulates cough receptors, leading to more frequent and intense coughing spells as the body attempts to maintain airway patency. The increased coughing can also be a sign of bronchospasm, further narrowing the airways.",

    },
    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Pulmonary infections in CF trigger a systemic inflammatory response, leading to increased metabolic demands and decreased appetite. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1, are released, which act on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite (anorexia). Additionally, the increased work of breathing associated with the infection consumes a significant number of calories. This combination of decreased caloric intake and increased energy expenditure can lead to weight loss or failure to gain weight, a critical indicator of an exacerbation, especially in children who are already at risk for malnutrition due to pancreatic insufficiency and malabsorption.",

    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Salty-tasting skin is a hallmark sign of CF, present even in the absence of infection. It results from the defective CFTR protein's inability to reabsorb chloride from sweat in the eccrine glands. Consequently, chloride remains in the sweat, and sodium follows to maintain electrochemical neutrality, leading to elevated salt concentrations on the skin. While this finding is essential for diagnosis (sweat chloride test), it is a chronic manifestation of the disease and does not indicate an acute pulmonary infection.",

    {
      "optionId": "e",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. A pulmonary infection in CF exacerbates airway obstruction due to increased mucus plugging, mucosal edema, and potential bronchospasm. This leads to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, resulting in impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia. The body must expend more energy on the work of breathing to maintain adequate oxygenation. Systemic inflammation, increased respiratory muscle effort, and reduced oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues manifest clinically as profound fatigue and a noticeable decrease in the child's ability to tolerate physical activity. The increased energy expenditure further contributes to weight loss.",

      "content": "Correct. New or worsening adventitious lung sounds are direct indicators of changing airway dynamics. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound caused by turbulent airflow through narrowed airways, resulting from inflammation, bronchospasm, and mucus plugs. Crackles (rales) are discontinuous, popping sounds caused by the sudden opening of small airways and alveoli that were previously collapsed by fluid or inflammatory exudate. The onset of these sounds signifies increased airway obstruction and fluid accumulation, characteristic of an active infectious process. Auscultation should be performed systematically to identify the location and characteristics of these sounds.",

    "title": "Baseline Finding vs. Acute Exacerbation",
    "content": "The primary trap in this question is differentiating between a chronic, hallmark sign of the disease and an acute sign of a complication. Salty-tasting skin is pathognomonic for cystic fibrosis due to the underlying chloride channel defect. Test-takers who simply associate this sign with CF, without considering the stem's focus on 'pulmonary infection', will incorrectly select it. The question requires the nurse to identify *changes* from the child's baseline that signal an acute infectious process, not the static characteristics of the disease itself. Focus on changes in respiratory status and systemic symptoms."
