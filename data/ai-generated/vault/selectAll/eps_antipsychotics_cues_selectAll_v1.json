      "optionId": "a",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Akathisia is a classic EPS. Pathophysiology: This profound inner restlessness is linked to dopamine (D2) receptor blockade in the mesocortical pathway, disrupting the brain's ability to regulate motor activity and generating a subjective, compelling need to be in constant motion. Clinical Pearl: Akathisia can be very distressing for the client and may be mistaken for anxiety or agitation. Careful assessment is key."

    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Acute dystonia is a type of EPS that often occurs early in treatment. Pathophysiology: Potent D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway creates an acute excess of acetylcholine. This cholinergic hyperactivity triggers sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, commonly seen as torticollis (neck twisting) or oculogyric crisis (upward eye deviation). Clinical Pearl: Acute dystonic reactions can be frightening and painful. Prompt treatment with an anticholinergic medication is essential."

      "optionId": "c",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Pseudoparkinsonism is a common EPS. Pathophysiology: D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway directly mimics the dopamine-deficient state of Parkinson's disease. This disrupts the fine motor control functions of the basal ganglia, leading to bradykinesia (shuffling gait), rigidity (mask-like face), and resting tremor. Clinical Pearl: Assess for rigidity by checking for cogwheel rigidity at the wrist. Differentiate from true Parkinson's disease through medication history and symptom onset."

    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This triad describes Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening emergency, not a standard EPS. Pathophysiology: NMS results from a severe, rapid dopamine blockade in the hypothalamus (causing hyperthermia and autonomic failure) and the basal ganglia (causing extreme 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity). This is a systemic crisis, distinct from the localized movement disorders of EPS. Clinical Pearl: NMS requires immediate medical intervention, including discontinuation of the antipsychotic and supportive care to manage hyperthermia and autonomic instability."

    {
      "optionId": "e",
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a late-onset EPS. Pathophysiology: Chronic D2 receptor blockade causes the postsynaptic D2 receptors to become supersensitive and upregulate (increase in number). This leads to a hyperdopaminergic state, resulting in involuntary, repetitive, hyperkinetic movements, particularly of the orofacial muscles. Although it typically appears late, recognizing these movements is a key nursing assessment. Clinical Pearl: Tardive dyskinesia is often irreversible. Early detection and medication adjustments are crucial to minimize its impact."

    {
      "optionId": "f",
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is an autonomic side effect, not an extrapyramidal symptom. Pathophysiology: Orthostatic hypotension is caused by the blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on peripheral blood vessels. This prevents the compensatory vasoconstriction needed upon standing, leading to peripheral blood pooling and a drop in cerebral perfusion, causing dizziness and fall risk. It is unrelated to the dopamine pathways of the basal ganglia. Clinical Pearl: Educate clients to change positions slowly to minimize orthostatic hypotension. Monitor blood pressure lying, sitting, and standing."
