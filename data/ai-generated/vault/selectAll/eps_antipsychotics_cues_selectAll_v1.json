This leads to a hyperdopaminergic state, resulting in involuntary, repetitive, hyperkinetic movements, particularly of the orofacial muscles. Although it typically appears late, recognizing these movements is a key nursing assessment."

This prevents the compensatory vasoconstriction needed upon standing, leading to peripheral blood pooling and a drop in cerebral perfusion, causing dizziness and fall risk. It is unrelated to the dopamine pathways of the basal ganglia."
