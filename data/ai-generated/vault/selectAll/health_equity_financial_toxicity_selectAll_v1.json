    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Consulting a social worker or case manager (SWM) is crucial. These professionals specialize in navigating complex financial aid systems. They can connect the client with Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) or foundational grants. This systemic intervention addresses the root financial barrier, preventing the clinical consequences of untreated chronic disease. SWMs understand eligibility criteria and application processes, streamlining access to resources. ClinicalPearl: Early SWM involvement can significantly improve medication adherence and overall health outcomes.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Potential for non-adherence due to financial constraints. Recommendation: Consult social worker at 1400 to explore PAPs and grants."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Advising a client to alter their medication dosage is unsafe and outside the nurse's scope of practice. Cutting pills can lead to critical pharmacokinetic changes. For example, splitting an extended-release tablet (e.g., metoprolol succinate) can cause 'dose dumping,' leading to a rapid, toxic release of the drug and potentially profound hypotension. Splitting an enteric-coated tablet destroys the protective layer, risking gastric irritation or ulceration. This advice introduces iatrogenic harm. ClinicalPearl: Never advise patients to alter medication dosages without provider consultation.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Client considering altering medication dosage to save money. Recommendation: Do not cut pills. Contact provider at 1400 to discuss alternative options."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Assessing transportation affordability demonstrates a holistic assessment of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). Financial toxicity is often multi-faceted. A client unable to afford a co-pay is at high risk for being unable to afford transportation to obtain the medication, even if it were free. Identifying this concurrent barrier is critical to creating a realistic plan of care and ensuring the client can physically access the prescribed therapy. Transportation insecurity is a significant barrier to healthcare access. ClinicalPearl: Always assess for related SDOH when addressing financial barriers.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Potential transportation barrier to pharmacy. Recommendation: Assess transportation options at 1400 and connect with resources if needed."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Coordinating with the provider to explore lower-cost generic alternatives is a primary advocacy action within the nurse's role. Generic medications are mandated by the FDA to be bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts, meaning they have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, dosage, and therapeutic effect. By initiating a conversation with the provider, the nurse facilitates a change to a more affordable option without compromising the pharmacodynamic action required to manage the client's condition. ClinicalPearl: Advocate for generic medications whenever appropriate to reduce patient costs.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Potential to switch to generic medication. Recommendation: Contact provider at 1400 to discuss generic alternatives."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The term 'non-compliant' is pejorative and inaccurate in this context. It assigns blame to the client and fails to describe the systemic barrier. This can introduce provider bias into the medical record, hindering future attempts to address the root cause. The correct, objective documentation is 'Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay,' which accurately reflects the situation and identifies a Social Determinant of Health requiring intervention. ClinicalPearl: Use objective language when documenting barriers to care.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Risk of inaccurate documentation. Recommendation: Document 'Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay' at 1400."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Providing information about local charity pharmacies or community health centers offers an immediate, tangible resource to bridge the gap in care. These organizations often have programs to dispense medications at low or no cost to qualifying individuals. Providing this specific, actionable information empowers the client and offers a short-term solution while more permanent aid (e.g., through a social worker) is being established. ClinicalPearl: Keep a list of local resources readily available for patients facing financial barriers.",
      "SBAR": "Situation: Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay. Background: Client has new medication regimen. Assessment: Need for immediate medication access. Recommendation: Provide information on local charity pharmacies at 1400."

  "questionTrap": {
    "content": "The primary trap is confusing the nurse's role as educator with their role as advocate and coordinator. While patient education is vital, simply telling the client about the medication is insufficient when a systemic barrier like cost exists. The nurse's responsibility extends to actively intervening by coordinating with the team (provider, social work) and connecting the client to resources to overcome the barrier. A secondary trap is using judgmental language like 'non-compliant' instead of objective descriptions of the barrier."

  "mnemonics": {
    "content": "Use the 'REACH' framework to address financial barriers: R - Recognize the barrier (e.g., 'I can't afford this'). E - Explore alternatives (e.g., generics, different therapies). A - Assess related factors (e.g., transportation, food security). C - Connect to resources (e.g., social work, PAPs, charity pharmacies). H - Help document objectively (e.g., 'unable to afford' vs. 'non-compliant')."
