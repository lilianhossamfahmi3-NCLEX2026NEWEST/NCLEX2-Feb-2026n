        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. A social worker or case manager is a specialized member of the interdisciplinary team with expertise in navigating complex systems of financial aid. They can directly connect the client with Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) or foundational grants, which is a key systemic intervention to resolve the root financial barrier and prevent the clinical sequelae of untreated chronic disease."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This action is unsafe and outside the scope of nursing practice. Altering a medication's prescribed dose can lead to critical pharmacokinetic changes. For example, splitting an extended-release tablet (e.g., metoprolol succinate) causes 'dose dumping,' leading to a rapid, toxic release of the drug and potentially profound hypotension. Splitting an enteric-coated tablet destroys the protective layer, risking gastric ulceration. This advice introduces iatrogenic harm."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. This demonstrates a holistic assessment of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). Financial toxicity is often multi-faceted; a client unable to afford a co-pay is at high risk for being unable to afford transportation to obtain the medication, even if it were free. Identifying this concurrent barrier is critical to creating a realistic plan of care and ensuring the client can physically access the prescribed therapy."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. This is a primary advocacy action within the nurse's role. Generic medications are mandated by the FDA to be bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts, meaning they have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, dosage, and therapeutic effect. By initiating a conversation with the provider, the nurse facilitates a change to a more affordable option without compromising the pharmacodynamic action required to manage the client's condition."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. The term 'non-compliant' is pejorative and inaccurate in this context. It assigns blame to the client and fails to describe the systemic barrier. This can introduce provider bias into the medical record, hindering future attempts to address the root cause. The correct, objective documentation is 'Client reports inability to afford medication co-pay,' which accurately reflects the situation and identifies a Social Determinant of Health requiring intervention."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. This action provides an immediate, tangible resource to bridge the gap in care. Charity pharmacies and community health centers often have programs to dispense medications at low or no cost to qualifying individuals. Providing this specific, actionable information empowers the client and offers a short-term solution while more permanent aid (e.g., through a social worker) is being established."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": {
        "content": "The primary trap is confusing the nurse's role as educator with their role as advocate and coordinator. While patient education is vital, simply telling the client about the medication is insufficient when a systemic barrier like cost exists. The nurse's responsibility extends to actively intervening by coordinating with the team (provider, social work) and connecting the client to resources to overcome the barrier. A secondary trap is using judgmental language like 'non-compliant' instead of objective descriptions of the barrier."
    },
    "mnemonics": {
        "content": "Use the 'REACH' framework to address financial barriers: R - Recognize the barrier (e.g., 'I can't afford this'). E - Explore alternatives (e.g., generics, different therapies). A - Assess related factors (e.g., transportation, food security). C - Connect to resources (e.g., social work, PAPs, charity pharmacies). H - Help document objectively (e.g., 'unable to afford' vs. 'non-compliant')."
