      "content": "Correct. Lithium can interfere with the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine, leading to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium antagonizes the effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the renal collecting tubules. This impairment of ADH action reduces water reabsorption, leading to polyuria (increased urine output). The resulting fluid loss triggers the body's compensatory thirst mechanism, causing polydipsia (increased thirst). This is an expected finding at therapeutic levels (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage adequate fluid intake (2-3 liters daily) to prevent dehydration. Monitor urine output and signs of dehydration.",

      "content": "Correct. Fine hand tremors are a common neurological side effect of lithium, even at therapeutic doses. The mechanism is believed to involve lithium's interference with cation (Na+, K+) transport across neuronal membranes, which slightly alters neurotransmission in pathways controlling fine motor movements, such as the basal ganglia. It is typically postural and benign. **Clinical Pearl:** Reduce or eliminate caffeine intake, as it can exacerbate tremors. Propranolol may be prescribed to manage tremors.",

      "content": "Incorrect. A coarse tremor is a significant escalation from a fine tremor and is a hallmark sign of neurotoxicity. As lithium levels rise into the toxic range (>1.5 mEq/L), the disruption to the central nervous system, particularly the cerebellum and basal ganglia, becomes more severe, leading to pronounced, shaky tremors that indicate significant neuronal dysfunction and require immediate intervention. **Clinical Pearl:** Hold the lithium dose and notify the healthcare provider immediately if a coarse tremor develops.

At toxic levels, lithium severely irritates the GI mucosa, causing profuse diarrhea, which dangerously exacerbates toxicity by causing dehydration and reducing lithium clearance.

    "content": "The NGN exam frequently tests the ability to differentiate between a mild side effect and a severe toxic effect of the same physiological system. For lithium, 'tremors' and 'GI upset' exist on this spectrum. A *fine* tremor is expected; a *coarse* tremor indicates toxicity. *Mild, transient nausea* is expected; *severe, persistent diarrhea and vomiting* indicate toxicity. The adjective is the critical data point. Also, remember that any condition causing dehydration (diarrhea, vomiting, fever, excessive sweating) can rapidly increase lithium concentration and precipitate toxicity due to reduced renal excretion."
