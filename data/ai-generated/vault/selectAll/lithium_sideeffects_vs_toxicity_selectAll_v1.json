            "content": "Correct. Lithium antagonizes the effect of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) in the renal collecting tubules. This impairment of ADH action reduces water reabsorption, leading to polyuria (increased urine output). The resulting fluid loss triggers the body's compensatory thirst mechanism, causing polydipsia (increased thirst). This is an expected finding at therapeutic levels (0.6-1.2 mEq/L)."

            "content": "Correct. Fine hand tremors are a common neurological side effect of lithium, even at therapeutic doses. The mechanism is believed to involve lithium's interference with cation (Na+, K+) transport across neuronal membranes, which slightly alters neurotransmission in pathways controlling fine motor movements, such as the basal ganglia. It is typically postural and benign."

            "content": "Incorrect. A coarse tremor is a significant escalation from a fine tremor and is a hallmark sign of neurotoxicity. As lithium levels rise into the toxic range (>1.5 mEq/L), the disruption to the central nervous system, particularly the cerebellum and basal ganglia, becomes more severe, leading to pronounced, shaky tremors that indicate significant neuronal dysfunction and require immediate intervention."

            "content": "Correct. Weight gain is a common metabolic side effect. It can be caused by increased caloric intake from high-sugar beverages to quench lithium-induced thirst. Additionally, lithium can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis, potentially leading to hypothyroidism, which decreases metabolic rate and contributes to weight gain and fluid retention (edema)."

At toxic levels, lithium severely irritates the GI mucosa, causing profuse diarrhea, which dangerously exacerbates toxicity by causing dehydration and reducing lithium clearance. Ataxia (impaired coordination, unsteady gait) results from profound cerebellar toxicity, as the cerebellum is highly sensitive to elevated lithium levels."

This effect is usually temporary and often resolves as the body adapts. Administering the dose with meals or using an extended-release formulation can mitigate this initial side effect."

        "content": "The NGN exam frequently tests the ability to differentiate between a mild side effect and a severe toxic effect of the same physiological system. For lithium, 'tremors' and 'GI upset' exist on this spectrum. A *fine* tremor is expected; a *coarse* tremor indicates toxicity. *Mild, transient nausea* is expected; *severe, persistent diarrhea and vomiting* indicate toxicity. The adjective is the critical data point. Also, remember that any condition causing dehydration (diarrhea, vomiting, fever, excessive sweating) can rapidly increase lithium concentration and precipitate toxicity due to reduced renal excretion."
