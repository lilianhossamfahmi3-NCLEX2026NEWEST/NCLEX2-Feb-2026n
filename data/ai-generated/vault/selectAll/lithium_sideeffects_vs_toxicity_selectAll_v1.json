    "content": "The NGN exam frequently tests the ability to differentiate between a mild side effect and a severe toxic effect of the same physiological system. For lithium, 'tremors' and 'GI upset' exist on this spectrum. A *fine* tremor is expected; a *coarse* tremor indicates toxicity. *Mild, transient nausea* is expected; *severe, persistent diarrhea and vomiting* indicate toxicity. The adjective is the critical data point. Also, remember that any condition causing dehydration (diarrhea, vomiting, fever, excessive sweating) can rapidly increase lithium concentration and precipitate toxicity due to reduced renal excretion."
