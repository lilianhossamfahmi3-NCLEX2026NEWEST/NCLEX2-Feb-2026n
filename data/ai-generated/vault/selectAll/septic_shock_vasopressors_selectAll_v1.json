        "a": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. In septic shock, systemic vasodilation from inflammatory mediators causes a drastic drop in Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR), leading to profound hypotension. A MAP below 65 mmHg is insufficient to overcome vascular resistance in vital organs, compromising coronary, cerebral, and renal perfusion. Norepinephrine, a potent alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction, increases SVR, and raises MAP. Titrating to a MAP ≥65 mmHg is the standard goal to ensure adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery to these critical tissues."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Norepinephrine is a vesicant, meaning it can cause severe tissue damage if it leaks out of the vein (extravasation). Its potent alpha-1 adrenergic agonist action causes intense, localized vasoconstriction of the small vessels in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. This vasoconstriction completely cuts off local blood flow, leading to rapid tissue ischemia, hypoxia, and subsequent necrosis if not treated immediately. Frequent site assessment (for coolness, pallor, swelling, or pain) is critical for early detection."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Administering a continuous vesicant infusion like norepinephrine through a peripheral line is a high-risk, temporary measure used only in emergencies until central venous access is obtained. The term 'indefinitely' makes this action unsafe. Peripheral veins are smaller and have lower blood flow, increasing the risk of mechanical dislodgement and extravasation. The standard of care is to administer vasopressors via a central venous catheter, which terminates in a large, high-flow vessel (e.g., superior vena cava), allowing for rapid hemodilution and minimizing both vascular irritation and the catastrophic consequences of extravasation."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Norepinephrine's therapeutic effect of increasing SVR is achieved by potent peripheral vasoconstriction. This life-saving action shunts blood from the periphery (skin, extremities, gut) to the vital central organs (heart, brain, kidneys). A direct consequence of this shunting is reduced perfusion to the distal extremities. High doses or prolonged use can lead to severe ischemia, manifesting as cold, pale, cyanotic, or mottled fingers and toes, potentially progressing to gangrene. Monitoring for these signs is a priority."
        },
        "e": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Phentolamine is the specific antidote for norepinephrine extravasation. It is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that directly counteracts norepinephrine's vasoconstrictive effects at the site of infiltration. By competitively blocking the alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, phentolamine induces local vasodilation, restores blood flow to the ischemic tissue, and can prevent or minimize tissue necrosis. Having it readily available is a critical safety measure, as treatment must be initiated within minutes to hours of the event to be effective."
        },
        "f": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Abruptly discontinuing a norepinephrine infusion will cause severe rebound hypotension. Prolonged stimulation of adrenergic receptors by the infusion can lead to their downregulation or desensitization. The client's vascular tone becomes dependent on the exogenous norepinephrine. Suddenly stopping the drug removes this support, and the desensitized endogenous system cannot compensate quickly, leading to a precipitous drop in SVR and blood pressure. The infusion must be tapered slowly, allowing the body's own catecholamine system and receptor sensitivity to recover and maintain hemodynamic stability."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is distinguishing between emergency, short-term actions and the definitive standard of care. While a peripheral IV might be used to initiate norepinephrine in a crisis, the word 'indefinitely' makes it incorrect and dangerous. The NGN candidate must recognize that vasopressors require central line access as soon as feasible to mitigate the severe risk of tissue necrosis from extravasation. This highlights the critical thinking required to balance immediate life-saving interventions with long-term safety protocols.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the mnemonic 'SCAN' for norepinephrine safety priorities:\n\n*   **S**ite: Assess site frequently for extravasation; secure a **S**uperior Vena Cava (central) line ASAP.\n*   **C**irculation: Maintain MAP ≥65 mmHg for vital organ perfusion; check distal **C**irculation for ischemia (cold digits).\n*   **A**ntidote: Ensure phentolamine is **A**vailable.\n*   **N**ever stop abruptly: Titrate and wean slowly to prevent rebound hypotension."
