            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information (Protected Health Information, or PHI). Transmitting PHI through an unsecured email account constitutes an 'impermissible disclosure' because the data is not adequately protected from unauthorized access during transmission or on the recipient's or sender's personal servers. This action directly violates the core tenet of the rule, which is to ensure the confidentiality of PHI in all its forms."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The principle of non-maleficence ('do no harm') is violated because an unsecured email can be intercepted, hacked, or inadvertently sent to the wrong recipient. The 'pathophysiology of harm' from such a breach is significant and can manifest as financial ruin (from identity theft), social stigma (e.g., disclosure of mental health or infectious disease status), employment discrimination, or severe psychological distress for the client whose private information is exposed."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. The HIPAA Security Rule is a subset of HIPAA that specifically deals with Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). It mandates specific administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Sending lab results via unsecured email directly violates the 'technical safeguards' requirement, specifically the addressable implementation specification for encryption (45 CFR § 164.312(e)(2)(ii)), which protects ePHI as it is transmitted over an electronic network. Unsecured email lacks this end-to-end encryption, leaving the data vulnerable."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. The principle of veracity requires truth-telling and honesty. In this scenario, the issue is not the accuracy or truthfulness of the laboratory results being sent. The nurse could be sending completely accurate information, thereby upholding veracity. The violation lies in the *method* of communication, which compromises the client's privacy and security, not the *content* of the message."
        },
        "e": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Healthcare organizations are required by law (HIPAA) to create and enforce policies and procedures that protect PHI. These policies translate federal law into specific, actionable workplace rules. Virtually every healthcare facility has a strict policy prohibiting the use of personal, unsecured email for patient communication and requires the use of a secure, encrypted patient portal or messaging system. Violating this policy is a breach of the nurse's employment obligations and professional duty."
        },
        "f": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "Correct. Fidelity is the ethical principle of faithfulness to one's duties, commitments, and promises. As a licensed professional, a nurse makes an implicit promise to society and to each patient to uphold the standards of the profession, which include maintaining confidentiality (ANA Code of Ethics, Provision 3). Using an insecure communication method is a direct breach of this fundamental promise to protect the patient's private information."
