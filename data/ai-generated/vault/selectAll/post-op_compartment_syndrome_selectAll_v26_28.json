He reports severe, unrelenting pain in his left lower leg despite receiving 5mg IV morphine at 09:30. Pain is described as a deep, throbbing ache, rated 9/10, and is 'different' from his pre-operative pain.\n\nBackground: Admitted yesterday after a fall at home, sustaining a closed tibia fracture. His medical history includes hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, and type 2 diabetes, managed with metformin. He has no known drug allergies. Pre-operative pain was managed with oral acetaminophen.\n\nAssessment: Neurovascular assessment of the left lower leg reveals significant calf swelling, a foot that is pale and cool to the touch, a weak (1+) dorsalis pedis pulse, and reports of numbness and tingling in the toes. Pain increases with passive dorsiflexion of the foot. The dressing is dry and intact. Vital signs show an elevated heart rate (see Vitals tab).\n\nRecommendation: I am concerned about potential compartment syndrome in the left lower leg. I recommend an immediate surgical consult for possible fasciotomy. Given the client's report of unrelenting pain, elevated heart rate, and concerning neurovascular assessment findings, prompt intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible tissue damage. I would like to obtain stat orders for creatinine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurovascular status every hour.",
