      "SBAR": "10:00 - S: Mr. Jones, 68 years old, post-op day 0 ORIF tibia fracture, reporting severe pain in his left lower leg despite receiving 5mg IV morphine at 09:30. Pain is described as a deep, throbbing ache, rated 9/10. States pain is 'different' from pre-op pain. \n\nB: Admitted yesterday after falling at home, sustained a closed tibia fracture. PMH includes hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, and type 2 diabetes, managed with metformin. No known drug allergies. Pre-op pain was managed with oral acetaminophen.\n\nA: Neurovascular assessment of the left lower leg reveals the following: significant swelling of the calf, foot pale and cool to the touch, weak (1+) dorsalis pedis pulse, client reports numbness and tingling in the toes, pain increases with passive dorsiflexion of the foot. Dressing is dry and intact. Vital signs stable but heart rate elevated (see vitals tab). \n\nR: I am concerned about potential compartment syndrome in the left lower leg. Recommend immediate surgical consult for possible fasciotomy. Considering the client's report of unrelenting pain, elevated heart rate, and concerning neurovascular assessment findings, prompt intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Would like to obtain stat orders for creatinine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurovascular status every hour.",
