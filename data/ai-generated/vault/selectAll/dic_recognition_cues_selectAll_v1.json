During the thrombotic phase of DIC, there is a massive and uncontrolled conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. This rapid consumption depletes the body's stores of fibrinogen, leading to hypofibrinogenemia. This lack of available fibrinogen critically impairs hemostasis and contributes significantly to the bleeding phase."

The defining pathophysiology involves the massive, systemic activation of coagulation, leading to the formation of innumerable microthrombi. Platelets are a primary component of these thrombi and are therefore rapidly consumed. This leads to a precipitous drop in the platelet count, a condition known as consumptive thrombocytopenia. An increase to 450,000/mm³ (thrombocytosis) is inconsistent with the diagnosis."
