The drop in the white blood cell count from 50,000 to 2,000/mm³ indicates successful lysis of the leukemic cells by chemotherapy. While this massive cell death is the prerequisite for TLS, the syndrome itself is defined by the subsequent metabolic derangements (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, etc.) and end-organ damage. The nurse must recognize this as the cause, but not as a defining clinical feature of the resulting metabolic emergency."

Aggressive chemotherapy causes massive and rapid lysis of tumor cells, releasing this large intracellular potassium store into the bloodstream. The kidneys' capacity to excrete potassium is quickly overwhelmed, leading to hyperkalemia. This is the most life-threatening complication of TLS because it directly impacts cardiac myocyte membrane potential, causing peaked T-waves, QRS widening, and progressing to ventricular fibrillation or asystole."

Cell lysis releases this phosphate (from phospholipids, ATP, and nucleic acids) into the serum.

Two processes occur simultaneously: 1) Hyperuricemia leads to the precipitation of uric acid crystals in the acidic environment of the renal tubules. 2) Hyperphosphatemia combines with serum calcium to form calcium phosphate crystals. Both types of crystals deposit within the tubules, causing physical obstruction, inflammation, and a sharp decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This manifests as oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr) and cloudy urine due to the crystaluria."

The liver metabolizes the purine bases (adenine, guanine) from these nucleic acids into uric acid via the xanthine oxidase pathway. The sheer volume of purines overwhelms this pathway and the kidneys' ability to clear the uric acid, resulting in severe hyperuricemia. This is a hallmark of TLS."

The elevated serum phosphate avidly binds with ionized (free) serum calcium to form insoluble calcium phosphate precipitates. This process effectively removes physiologically active calcium from circulation. The resulting hypocalcemia increases neuromuscular excitability, leading to clinical signs such as tetany (Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs), seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias (prolonged QT interval)."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing the cause of TLS with the effects that define the syndrome. The dropping WBC count is a sign that chemotherapy is successfully lysing the leukemic cells—the event that precipitates TLS. However, TLS is diagnosed by the specific metabolic abnormalities (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and secondary hypocalcemia) and resulting organ dysfunction (e.g., AKI). Test-takers might incorrectly select the WBC drop because it is logically related, but it is not a defining feature of the syndrome according to diagnostic criteria like the Cairo-Bishop classification.",
