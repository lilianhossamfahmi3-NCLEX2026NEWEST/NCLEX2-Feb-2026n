    "a": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Chronic mild (fine) hand tremors are an expected, common side effect of lithium, even within the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Pathophysiologically, lithium, a monovalent cation, alters nerve conduction and neurotransmitter release, particularly in the basal ganglia and cerebellum which regulate fine motor control. This neuronal disruption manifests as a fine postural tremor and is not an indicator of toxicity."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "This is a correct finding for early to moderate lithium toxicity (levels >1.5 mEq/L). Pathophysiologically, lithium directly irritates the gastrointestinal mucosa. At toxic levels, this irritation intensifies, causing severe vomiting and diarrhea. This creates a dangerous positive feedback loop: the resulting fluid and sodium loss leads to dehydration, which triggers the kidneys to increase sodium and lithium reabsorption, thereby elevating serum lithium levels and worsening the toxicity."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "This is a correct finding indicating significant neurotoxicity. Pathophysiologically, as lithium levels rise into the toxic range (>1.5 mEq/L), its disruptive effect on the cerebellum becomes pronounced. The cerebellum governs coordination, balance, and smooth motor function. Toxic lithium concentrations impair cerebellar activity, causing ataxia (an uncoordinated, staggering gait) and transforming the common fine tremor into a coarse, irregular tremor, which signals advanced neurological impairment."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Polyuria and polydipsia are common, long-term side effects, not acute signs of toxicity. Pathophysiologically, lithium can induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) by entering the renal collecting duct cells and interfering with the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This impairs water reabsorption, leading to the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine (polyuria) and compensatory thirst. While this condition can cause dehydration and increase the risk for toxicity, it is an expected side effect at therapeutic levels."
    },
    "e": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "This is a correct finding indicative of moderate to severe central nervous system toxicity. Pathophysiologically, high lithium concentrations (>1.5-2.0 mEq/L) globally disrupt neuronal function by interfering with ion transport (Na+, K+, Ca++) across cell membranes. This alters action potentials and neurotransmitter systems, leading to widespread CNS depression. This manifests clinically as cognitive deficits like confusion, disorientation, lethargy, and cerebellar dysfunction such as dysarthria (slurred speech)."
    },
    "f": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Early to moderate lithium toxicity is more characteristically associated with neuromuscular *excitability*, such as hyperreflexia and fasciculations (muscle twitching). Pathophysiologically, this initial hyperexcitability is due to lithium's alteration of ion gradients across neuronal membranes. Hyporeflexia and flaccidity are signs of profound, late-stage toxicity where severe CNS depression has occurred, but hyperreflexia is the more classic finding in the stages associated with confusion and ataxia."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Side Effect vs. Toxicity: The Lithium Dilemma",
    "content": "The primary challenge in this question is differentiating between common, expected side effects of lithium therapy and the dangerous signs of acute toxicity. Many candidates incorrectly select options related to expected side effects, such as fine hand tremors (Option A) and polyuria/thirst (Option D), because they are well-known effects of the drug. The key is to recognize that toxicity is an *escalation* of these effects (fine tremor becomes coarse) or the emergence of new, severe symptoms (GI distress, significant CNS changes like confusion and ataxia)."
