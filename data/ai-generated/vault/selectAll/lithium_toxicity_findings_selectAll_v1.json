    "a": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Fine hand tremors are a common side effect of lithium, especially within the therapeutic range. While bothersome, they are not indicative of toxicity. Lithium affects nerve conduction and neurotransmitter release, leading to these tremors. Toxicity is indicated by worsening tremors (coarse tremors)."
    },
    "b": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Severe and persistent diarrhea and vomiting are signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium irritates the gastrointestinal mucosa, and at toxic levels, this irritation intensifies. This leads to fluid and electrolyte loss, which can worsen the toxicity by increasing lithium reabsorption in the kidneys."
    },
    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Coarse tremors and ataxia (uncoordinated movements) are signs of lithium toxicity, indicating neurological impairment. Lithium affects the cerebellum, which controls coordination and balance. Toxic levels disrupt cerebellar function, leading to these symptoms."
    },
    "d": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Polyuria (excessive urination) and mild thirst are common side effects of lithium, often due to lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. While these side effects can contribute to dehydration and increase the risk of toxicity, they are not direct indicators of toxicity themselves."
    },
    "e": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Confusion and slurred speech are signs of lithium toxicity, indicating central nervous system (CNS) involvement. High lithium levels disrupt neuronal function, affecting ion transport and neurotransmitter systems, leading to CNS depression and cognitive impairment."
    },
    "f": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Early lithium toxicity is more often associated with neuromuscular excitability, such as hyperreflexia (increased reflexes) and muscle twitching. Hyporeflexia and muscle weakness are signs of severe, late-stage toxicity where CNS depression is significant."
    }

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Distinguishing Side Effects from Toxicity",
    "content": "This question requires differentiating between common side effects of lithium and signs of toxicity. Many students may incorrectly select options related to expected side effects, such as fine hand tremors and polyuria/thirst. The key is to recognize that toxicity involves an escalation of these effects (fine tremor becomes coarse) or the emergence of new, severe symptoms (GI distress, significant CNS changes)."

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct answers are severe persistent diarrhea and vomiting, coarse tremors and ataxia, and confusion and slurred speech. These findings indicate lithium toxicity. Severe diarrhea and vomiting cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen lithium toxicity. Coarse tremors and ataxia indicate neurological impairment due to lithium's effect on the cerebellum. Confusion and slurred speech also indicate CNS involvement. Fine tremors and polyuria/thirst are common side effects, not signs of toxicity. Hyporeflexia and muscle weakness are signs of severe, late-stage toxicity."
