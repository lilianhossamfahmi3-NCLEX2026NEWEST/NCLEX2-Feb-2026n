Severe diarrhea and vomiting cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen lithium toxicity. Coarse tremors and ataxia indicate neurological impairment due to lithium's effect on the cerebellum. Confusion and slurred speech also indicate CNS involvement. Fine tremors and polyuria/thirst are common side effects, not signs of toxicity. Hyporeflexia and muscle weakness are signs of severe, late-stage toxicity.",

Many students may incorrectly select options related to expected side effects, such as fine hand tremors and polyuria/thirst. The key is to recognize that toxicity involves an escalation of these effects (fine tremor becomes coarse) or the emergence of new, severe symptoms (GI distress, significant CNS changes)."
