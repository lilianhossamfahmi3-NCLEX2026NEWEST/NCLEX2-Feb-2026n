            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "The pulmonary arteries are low-pressure, thin-walled vessels. Over-inflation beyond the manufacturer's specified volume (typically 1.5 mL) dramatically increases intraluminal pressure against the vessel wall. This can cause vessel stretching, dissection, or outright rupture, leading to life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage. Adhering to the exact volume ensures the balloon occludes a small, distal pulmonary artery branch just enough to halt forward blood flow and reflect left atrial pressure, without exerting excessive shear stress on the delicate endothelial lining.",
            "questionTrap": "The trap is assuming a larger volume is needed to achieve a good 'wedge' or that the volume is arbitrary. The specific volume is a critical safety limit directly related to the average diameter of the distal pulmonary arteries and is not negotiable.",

            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "Inflating the balloon creates a temporary, complete occlusion of a distal pulmonary artery branch, which halts all blood flow to the downstream lung segment. Prolonged occlusion (beyond 10-15 seconds or 2-4 respiratory cycles) causes a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion (V/Q), leading to localized tissue hypoxia, ischemia, and potential infarction of that lung segment. A stable PAWP reading is obtained almost instantaneously once forward flow ceases; a 60-second inflation guarantees iatrogenic tissue damage without any benefit to data accuracy.",
            "questionTrap": "The user may confuse the need for a 'stable' reading with the need for prolonged measurement time. In hemodynamics, stability is achieved rapidly, and prolonged measurement introduces a severe, preventable complication.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "The balloon is engineered to recoil to its deflated state due to its material elasticity and the external pressure from pulmonary artery blood flow. Actively aspirating air with the syringe creates negative pressure, which can cause the balloon to adhere to the catheter tip in a distorted shape or weaken the balloon material, increasing the risk of rupture on subsequent inflations. Passive deflation ensures a smooth, complete return to the non-wedged state, allowing the catheter to float back into the main pulmonary artery and immediately restoring blood flow to the previously occluded lung segment.",
            "questionTrap": "The instinct might be to actively pull back on the syringe to speed up deflation. This is incorrect and dangerous, as it can damage the catheter's delicate balloon mechanism and compromise future measurements.",

            "content": "The phlebostatic axis (fourth intercostal space, mid-axillary line) approximates the anatomical position of the right atrium. According to Pascal's law for fluid-filled systems, gravity exerts hydrostatic pressure. Leveling the transducer to this axis 'zeros' out the pressure artifact caused by the weight of the fluid in the tubing. A transducer positioned too low will add hydrostatic pressure, falsely elevating the PAWP. A transducer positioned too high will subtract pressure via a siphon effect, falsely lowering the PAWP. This step is a fundamental principle of physics required to ensure the electronic signal accurately reflects the patient's true intravascular pressure, which is used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).",

Incorrect leveling leads to erroneous data, which can trigger inappropriate fluid administration or withholding of necessary therapies.",

            "content": "The transition from a pulmonary artery (PA) waveform to a PAWP waveform has a distinct, required morphology. The PA waveform shows a clear dicrotic notch and higher systolic/diastolic pressures. Upon correct balloon inflation, the waveform should immediately flatten, lose its pulsatile nature, and show smaller 'a' and 'v' waves reflecting left atrial pressure dynamics. Failure to observe this change indicates that a true wedge has not been achieved. This could be due to an unoccluded vessel, a ruptured balloon, or the catheter tip being against the vessel wall (dampened waveform). Recording a value from a non-wedge waveform provides clinically useless and dangerously misleading information about left ventricular preload.",
            "questionTrap": "The trap is focusing only on the numerical value displayed on the monitor while ignoring the waveform morphology. A dampened PA waveform can produce a number similar to a true wedge pressure but reflects a different physiological state (catheter occlusion) and does not accurately represent left atrial pressure.",

However, this action is not indicated for the routine, brief procedure of obtaining a single PAWP measurement. The act of inflating the balloon for 10-15 seconds in a distal pulmonary artery branch has no pathophysiological mechanism to cause acute valvular damage. This assessment is mismatched with the specific risks of the task described.",
            "questionTrap": "This is a 'true but not relevant' distractor. Assessing for murmurs is a valid nursing action for patients with PA catheters, but it is not required for the specific, discrete task in the stem. The trap is over-applying a valid assessment to an inappropriate context.",
