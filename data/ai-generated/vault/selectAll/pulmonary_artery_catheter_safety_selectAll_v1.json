    "a": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Inflating the balloon with more than the recommended volume (typically 1.5 mL) can cause pulmonary artery rupture. The pulmonary arteries are thin-walled and susceptible to injury from over-inflation. Rupture can lead to pulmonary hemorrhage, a life-threatening complication. Using the correct volume ensures the balloon occludes the vessel without causing excessive pressure. The PAWP reflects left atrial pressure, which is an indirect measure of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).",

    "b": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Prolonged balloon inflation occludes blood flow to the distal pulmonary artery, causing a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. This can lead to pulmonary infarction and tissue necrosis. The PAWP reading is obtained quickly once the balloon is inflated; prolonged inflation does not improve accuracy and increases the risk of complications. The occlusion causes localized hypoxia and ischemia.",

    "c": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Active aspiration can damage the balloon, causing it to adhere to the catheter tip or weaken the material. This increases the risk of rupture during subsequent inflations. Passive deflation allows the balloon to return to its original shape and ensures the catheter floats freely in the pulmonary artery. The balloon is designed to deflate passively due to its elasticity and the pressure from pulmonary artery blood flow.",
      "questionTrap": "The trap is thinking active aspiration speeds up deflation. This is incorrect and dangerous.",
      "mnemonics": "Passive is safe, active is a risk.",
      "clinicalPearls": "If the balloon doesn't deflate passively, gently aspirate a *minimal* amount of air (<0.1 mL). Stop if resistance is met and consult a physician."

    "d": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "The phlebostatic axis (4th intercostal space, mid-axillary line) approximates the right atrium. Leveling the transducer to this point eliminates hydrostatic pressure effects, ensuring accurate pressure readings. A transducer positioned too low will falsely elevate the PAWP, while one positioned too high will falsely lower it. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest due to the force of gravity.",

    "e": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "The PAWP waveform should have a distinct morphology, different from the pulmonary artery (PA) waveform. The PA waveform has a dicrotic notch and higher systolic/diastolic pressures. A 'wedge' waveform is flatter and reflects left atrial pressure. Failure to see a wedge waveform indicates the balloon is not properly occluding the vessel, and the reading is inaccurate. A dampened PA waveform can mimic a wedge pressure but represents catheter occlusion, not left atrial pressure.",
      "questionTrap": "The trap is focusing on the numerical value without assessing the waveform.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Auscultating for a new murmur is important after *initial insertion* or if the catheter *migrates*, potentially damaging the tricuspid or pulmonic valves. It is not indicated for routine PAWP measurement. The brief balloon inflation does not cause valvular damage. Murmurs indicate valvular regurgitation due to structural damage.",
