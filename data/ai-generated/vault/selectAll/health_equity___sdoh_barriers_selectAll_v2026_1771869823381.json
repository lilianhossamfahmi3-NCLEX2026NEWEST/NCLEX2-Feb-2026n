Social Hx: Lives alone, limited income, reports difficulty accessing fresh produce. \n\n0605: Blood glucose trending high despite insulin. A1c 10.2%. States, \"I can't afford healthy food, doc. I usually buy cheap processed stuff.\"\n\n0610: Physical exam reveals BMI of 32. Reports foot numbness. No acute distress. \n\n0615: Discharge planned for today. Needs assistance managing diabetes due to SDOH.\n\n0620: Discussed resources with patient. Seems receptive but overwhelmed.

The patient's limited income and difficulty accessing fresh produce directly affect their ability to adhere to a diabetic diet, leading to poor glycemic control. Referring the patient to a food bank or pantry, connecting them with a community health worker, and enrolling them in a medically tailored meals program are all interventions that directly address these SDOH barriers. Adjusting insulin dosage without addressing the underlying dietary issues or only providing online resources are not adequate solutions.
