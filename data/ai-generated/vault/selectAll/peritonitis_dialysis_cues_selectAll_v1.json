    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "This is the earliest and most reliable sign of peritonitis. Pathophysiologically, bacterial contamination of the peritoneum triggers an acute inflammatory response. The body initiates chemotaxis, recruiting a high concentration of neutrophils and macrophages to the peritoneal cavity to fight the infection. These white blood cells, along with fibrin and proteinaceous exudate, become suspended in the dialysate, changing its appearance from clear to cloudy or opaque. A peritoneal fluid analysis showing >100 WBCs/mm³ with >50% neutrophils confirms the diagnosis."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Rebound tenderness is a classic physical assessment finding for peritoneal inflammation. The peritoneum has two layers: the visceral (covering organs) and the parietal (lining the abdominal wall). The parietal layer is innervated by somatic nerves that are highly sensitive to pain. When the abdomen is pressed, the inflamed layers are compressed. The sharp, intense pain occurs upon the rapid release of pressure, which causes the inflamed parietal peritoneum to stretch and rebound, directly stimulating these sensitive nerve fibers."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Fever and chills indicate a systemic response to the localized peritoneal infection. Bacteria release endotoxins, which stimulate macrophages to release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-alpha). These cytokines circulate to the hypothalamus, acting as pyrogens that reset the body's thermoregulatory set-point to a higher temperature, resulting in fever. Chills are caused by peripheral vasoconstriction and muscle shivering, which are the body's mechanisms to generate heat to reach the new, higher set-point."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This describes the expected, normal appearance of peritoneal dialysis effluent. The clear, straw-colored fluid indicates that ultrafiltration and diffusion are occurring across a healthy peritoneal membrane without an active inflammatory or infectious process. Its clarity confirms the absence of significant white blood cells, fibrin, or bacteria. This finding rules out, rather than suggests, peritonitis."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "In peritonitis, the peritoneal membrane becomes inflamed, edematous, and highly sensitive. During the inflow phase of dialysis, the instillation of 1.5-2.5 liters of dialysate stretches this irritated membrane, causing significant pain. The dialysate's temperature (if not properly warmed) and composition (e.g., low pH) can also act as direct chemical and thermal irritants to the inflamed tissue, further exacerbating the pain response."

      "correct": false,
      "content": "Constipation is a risk factor for mechanical outflow problems, not a direct sign of peritonitis. A full colon can compress the peritoneal catheter, impeding the drainage of effluent. While severe peritonitis can progress to a paralytic ileus with absent bowel sounds, simple constipation and decreased bowel sounds are more commonly associated with GI motility issues in ESRD clients (due to fluid restriction, diet, medications) rather than the infectious process of peritonitis itself."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Infection vs. Mechanical Issues in Peritoneal Dialysis",
    "content": "A common clinical reasoning error is confusing the signs of peritonitis (an infection) with signs of catheter or outflow problems (a mechanical issue). Cloudy effluent, fever, and diffuse rebound tenderness point directly to an infectious inflammatory process. In contrast, constipation, catheter kinking, or fibrin clots typically manifest as poor inflow/outflow volumes or localized pain at the catheter site without systemic signs like fever. The candidate must differentiate between the pathophysiology of infection and that of mechanical obstruction."
