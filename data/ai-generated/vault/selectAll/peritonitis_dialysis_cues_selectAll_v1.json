These cytokines circulate to the hypothalamus, acting as pyrogens that reset the body's thermoregulatory set-point to a higher temperature, resulting in fever. Chills are caused by peripheral vasoconstriction and muscle shivering, which are the body's mechanisms to generate heat to reach the new, higher set-point.",
