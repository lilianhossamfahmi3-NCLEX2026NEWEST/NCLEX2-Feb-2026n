Simultaneously, the profound hyperglycemia and high serum osmolality (352 mOsm/kg) are hallmark features of Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS), indicating a mixed crisis. The immediate priorities are to correct severe dehydration and begin lowering blood glucose. Therefore, initiating an isotonic IV fluid infusion (0.9% NaCl) is the first action to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. This is followed by a continuous IV infusion of regular insulin to gradually lower glucose and resolve ketosis. During treatment, it is critical to monitor serum potassium, as insulin drives potassium into cells, exacerbating the existing hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L) and risking fatal arrhythmias. Additionally, hourly neurological assessments are vital to monitor for cerebral edema, a potential complication of rapid fluid and osmolarity shifts.",
