The client lives alone in a rural area with limited access to transportation, which delayed him seeking timely primary care for his worsening urinary symptoms. He has a known allergy to Penicillin. \nA: Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C), HR 110, RR 24, BP 100/60 mmHg, SpO2 95% on room air. Client appears flushed and is warm to the touch. He is disoriented to time but oriented to person and place. Suspected urosepsis is the primary concern. \nR: Established two large-bore IVs. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and sent to the lab. Administered a 1L Lactated Ringers bolus. Awaiting initial lab results. Plan for direct admission to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.\n\nProgress Note (06:00):\nS: Client remains hypotensive despite receiving a total of 2L of IV fluids. \nB: Admitted at 03:00 for urosepsis. Central line was placed at 05:30 for CVP monitoring and vasopressor access. \nA: Current vitals: BP 80/40 mmHg (MAP 53), HR 120, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Client is increasingly lethargic, GCS has declined to 12. Skin is cool and clammy with mottling noted on lower extremities. Urine output is critically low at 20 mL in the past hour. CVP is 2 mmHg. STAT labs show a lactate of 4.5 mmol/L. The clinical picture indicates septic shock refractory to initial fluid resuscitation. \nR: Notified provider of persistent hypotension and oliguria. Received orders to start a norepinephrine infusion and titrate to maintain MAP >65 mmHg. Administer first dose of Ceftriaxone 1g IV now. Continue hourly I&O and vital sign monitoring."

The correct actions are to address the cause (infection) with broad-spectrum antibiotics and correct the vasodilation with vasopressors (norepinephrine). The key parameters to monitor are MAP, to titrate vasopressors for organ perfusion, and serum lactate, to assess the resolution of tissue hypoxia.",
