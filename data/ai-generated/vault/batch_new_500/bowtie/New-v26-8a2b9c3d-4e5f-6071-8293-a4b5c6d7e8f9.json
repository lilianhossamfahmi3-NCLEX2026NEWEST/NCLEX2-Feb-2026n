Patient reports dysuria and chills. B: History of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed with Metformin 500mg BID and Lisinopril 10mg daily. A: At 06:00, BP is 80/40 despite a 2L Lactated Ringers bolus. HR 120, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is increasingly confused, GCS 12. Urine output is 20 mL/hr, and CVP is 2 mmHg. Labs pending, but WBC is elevated. Possible septic shock. C: Provider notified at 06:15 regarding persistent hypotension and altered mental status. Orders received for stat labs (blood/urine cultures, lactate level) and Ceftriaxone 1g IV at 07:00. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. Consider central line if hypotension persists despite fluids.

        "correct": "The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, elevated lactate, elevated WBC, and positive urine culture strongly suggest septic shock. The low CVP indicates inadequate preload, necessitating further fluid resuscitation. Vasopressors are indicated to increase systemic vascular resistance and improve blood pressure. Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial to combat the infection. Monitoring urine output closely is essential to assess renal perfusion. Obtaining further blood cultures helps identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Elevating the head of the bed can improve ventilation and oxygenation.\n\nThe MOST likely cause is septic shock due to the UTI. The patient's elevated WBC, fever, positive urine culture, and elevated lactate levels are all indicative of a severe infection triggering a systemic inflammatory response. The hypotension and altered mental status further support this diagnosis.\n\nPotential interventions include further fluid boluses, vasopressor administration (e.g., norepinephrine), broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., Vancomycin/Zosyn), frequent vital sign monitoring, strict I&O monitoring, and repeat blood cultures. Clinical Pearl: Early intervention is key to improving outcomes in septic shock.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect actions or causes do not align with the patient's presentation and the pathophysiology of septic shock. For example, administering diuretics would worsen hypovolemia and hypotension. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is generally not recommended and may impair respiratory function. Waiting for blood culture results before initiating antibiotics delays crucial treatment and can worsen the patient's prognosis. Oxygen administration via non-rebreather mask might be considered if SpO2 does not improve with 2L NC, but is not the MOST important intervention at this time. The patient's CVP is low, therefore the problem is not fluid overload. Clinical Pearl: Hypotension in septic shock requires prompt fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.",
