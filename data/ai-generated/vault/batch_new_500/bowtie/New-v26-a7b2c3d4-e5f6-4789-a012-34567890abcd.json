His initial GCS was 10, but it's now decreased to 8. Blood pressure is 180/100, heart rate is 55, and respiratory rate is 10 and shallow. Oxygen saturation is 92% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. We're doing neuro checks every hour, and they're showing a decreasing level of consciousness. His pupils are sluggish, with the right pupil more dilated than the left. He's receiving IV fluids at 75 mL per hour. The CT scan showed increased edema. His family is at the bedside. I'm concerned about increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The provider was already made aware of the situation. At 0730, I notified the provider of the GCS change to 7. Orders were received for mannitol 0.25 grams per kilogram IV bolus stat and a repeat CT scan. At 0745, the mannitol was administered. We are monitoring him closely for a response. We need to continuously monitor ICP and manage his airway effectively.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions reflects the immediate and ongoing management of a patient with increased ICP following a hemorrhagic stroke. First, the nurse should elevate the head of the bed to promote venous drainage and reduce ICP. Then, administer the prescribed mannitol bolus to decrease cerebral edema by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space. Next, closely monitor the patient's neurological status, including GCS, pupillary response, and motor function, to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and detect any further deterioration. Followed by, assessing the patient's urine output because mannitol is an osmotic diuretic and can cause significant fluid shifts. Finally, prepare the patient for a repeat CT scan to assess the extent of the edema and the impact of the mannitol administration.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences may prioritize interventions based on convenience or incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. For example, delaying head elevation or administering mannitol before assessing baseline neurological status can negatively impact patient outcomes. Failing to monitor urine output after mannitol administration can lead to complications such as hypovolemia or electrolyte imbalances. Preparing for a CT scan before stabilizing the patient is unsafe.",
