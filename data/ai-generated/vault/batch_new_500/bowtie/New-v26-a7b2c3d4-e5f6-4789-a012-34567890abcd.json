Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees uses gravity to promote venous drainage from the brain, while administering the osmotic diuretic mannitol draws edematous fluid from the brain tissue into the vasculature.

                "Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)": "Correct. The constellation of signs, including the CT findings of hemorrhage with midline shift and the clinical presentation of Cushing's Triad, are hallmark indicators of dangerously elevated ICP.",
                "Ischemic Stroke": "Incorrect. The radiology report explicitly states a hemorrhagic stroke, not an ischemic one. The pathophysiology and immediate management are different.",
                "Hypertensive Crisis": "Incorrect. While the client has severe hypertension, it is a component of Cushing's Triad and a physiological response to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure against high ICP. The underlying problem is the ICP, not the hypertension itself."

                "Neurological status": "Correct. Frequent and detailed neurological assessments (GCS, pupillary response) are the most critical parameter for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing ICP.",
                "Serum osmolality": "Correct. Mannitol's effectiveness is dependent on creating an osmotic gradient. Monitoring serum osmolality is essential to ensure the drug is working and to prevent complications like acute kidney injury or excessive dehydration. The therapeutic range is typically 300-320 mOsm/kg.",
                "Bowel sounds": "Incorrect. While important for overall patient assessment, monitoring bowel sounds is not a priority parameter for evaluating the direct effects of interventions for increased ICP."
