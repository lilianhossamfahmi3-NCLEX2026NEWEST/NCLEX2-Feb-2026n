No known drug allergies. A: At 09:15, neuro assessment shows GCS 11 (E3, V3, M5). Right-sided weakness persists. Vitals: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 37.2°C. Emesis occurred at 09:10. P: Continuous neuro monitoring is crucial. Aggressively manage BP per stroke protocol, target SBP <180 mmHg. Implement strict aspiration precautions due to GCS and emesis. Prepare for possible intubation/ventilation if GCS declines or respiratory distress occurs. Neurosurgery consult requested.",

        "correct": "1. **Administer antihypertensive medication:** The patient's blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg exceeds the target SBP of <180 mmHg per stroke protocol. Rapid BP reduction is vital to prevent further neurological damage and hemorrhagic conversion. 2. **Elevate the head of the bed:** Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage, reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) and improving cerebral perfusion, crucial for neurological compromise. 3. **Monitor neurological status closely:** Continuous neurological assessment is essential to detect changes like worsening GCS or new deficits, enabling timely intervention. 4. **Implement aspiration precautions:** Emesis and decreased GCS increase aspiration risk. Precautions like positioning and suctioning prevent aspiration pneumonia. 5. **Prepare for potential intubation:** A GCS of 11 indicates altered consciousness and airway compromise. Preparing for intubation ensures airway security if deterioration occurs. 6. **Notify the physician of changes in condition:** While important, this follows immediate interventions to stabilize the patient.",
