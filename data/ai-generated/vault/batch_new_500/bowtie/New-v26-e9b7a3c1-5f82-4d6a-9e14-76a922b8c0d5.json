His blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 28, and temperature 102.5°F (39.2°C). Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. He has a recent history of a urinary tract infection treated with amoxicillin.\nB: The patient resides in a long-term care facility and has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also has a history of MRSA colonization.\nA: The patient is lethargic and only responds to painful stimuli. Lab results show an elevated WBC count (18,000/µL), elevated lactate level (4.0 mmol/L), creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, and BUN 35 mg/dL. Urine culture is pending. Assessment reveals diffuse crackles in both lungs. A central line was placed at 04:00.\nR: I anticipate orders for broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors if needed. I will closely monitor vital signs, reassess the patient frequently, and monitor cardiac rhythm continuously. Strict monitoring of intake and output is also required.",

        "correct": "The patient presents with signs of septic shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and elevated lactate. Rapid interventions are crucial. Administering a fluid bolus addresses hypovolemia and supports blood pressure. Obtaining blood cultures before administering antibiotics is essential to identify the causative organism. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly improves the chance of survival in septic patients. Applying oxygen supports oxygenation, which is compromised due to increased metabolic demand and potential respiratory dysfunction. Monitoring urine output assesses renal perfusion and response to fluid resuscitation. Titrating vasopressors (if fluids are not enough) maintains adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion.\n\nReasoning for the order: Septic shock protocol emphasizes early goal-directed therapy. Fluid resuscitation is first-line, followed by antibiotics and vasopressors if needed. Cultures should be obtained before antibiotics whenever possible without significantly delaying antibiotic administration. Oxygen is crucial for hypoxia. Monitoring urine output provides vital information about renal perfusion.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying fluid resuscitation in a hypotensive patient with sepsis can lead to organ damage and death. Administering antibiotics without obtaining blood cultures can hinder accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic selection. Waiting for lab results before intervening can significantly worsen the patient's prognosis. While pain management is important, it is not the immediate priority in this scenario. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended and can worsen respiratory function. Administering antipyretics without addressing the underlying infection only masks the symptom and doesn't treat the cause. A restrictive fluid strategy can be detrimental in sepsis, where hypovolemia is a major concern.",
