        "correct": "The client's presentation of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg), tachycardia, fever, altered mental status, and a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L in the presence of a suspected infection (UTI) is definitive for septic shock. Septic shock is a distributive shock state where massive vasodilation and capillary leakage, triggered by a dysregulated host response to infection, lead to severe tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction. The primary goals are to restore intravascular volume, maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) for organ perfusion, and control the source of infection.",
        "incorrect": "Chronic Hypertension is a background medical condition, not an acute cause of shock; the client is currently hypotensive. Administering furosemide, a diuretic, would be catastrophic as it would exacerbate hypovolemia and worsen hypotension. While the client is tachypneic and has crackles, preparing for immediate intubation is premature. The priority is to address the circulatory collapse with fluids and vasopressors, which may improve respiratory status by improving perfusion to respiratory muscles. Intubation is reserved for worsening respiratory failure unresponsive to initial resuscitation.",

Immunosenescence, the age-related decline of the immune system, makes older adults more susceptible to infections and less able to mount an effective response.
