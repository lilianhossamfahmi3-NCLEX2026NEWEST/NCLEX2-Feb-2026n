Admitted for unstable angina. CABG performed successfully. Initial post-op course was stable.\nA: At 06:00, patient's SpO2 decreased to 88% despite FiO2 of 50%. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 cm H2O to 35 cm H2O. ABG at 06:30: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, HCO3- 24 mEq/L. The patient is restless and attempting to cough against the ventilator. Current ventilator settings: Assist-Control, Rate 12, Tidal Volume 450 mL, FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O. 06:45: Suctioned moderate amount of thick, white secretions.\nR: I recommend assessing for possible causes of increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance, such as retained secretions, atelectasis, or pneumothorax. Consider adjusting ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Obtain a chest x-ray if indicated. Notify the physician.",

Notifying the physician is essential for further evaluation and management.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a neuromuscular blocking agent without addressing the underlying cause of the patient's distress is inappropriate and can mask the problem. Decreasing PEEP may worsen oxygenation, especially with existing atelectasis. Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position increases the risk of aspiration and does not address the underlying respiratory issues. Disconnecting the ventilator is dangerous and should only be done in emergency situations with a bag-valve-mask available. Performing chest compressions is inappropriate as there is no indication of cardiac arrest.",
