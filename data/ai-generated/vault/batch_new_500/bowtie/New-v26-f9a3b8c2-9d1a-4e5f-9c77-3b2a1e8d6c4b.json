The most likely cause in a post-operative, ventilated client is retained secretions leading to atelectasis. Therefore, the priority is to clear the airway and improve oxygenation. Suctioning directly addresses the obstruction, while increasing the FiO₂ directly treats the hypoxemia. Monitoring PIP will confirm the resolution of the obstruction (it should decrease), and tracking SpO₂ and repeat ABGs will evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions on gas exchange.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a neuromuscular blocker is dangerous as it masks the underlying problem and eliminates the client's respiratory drive without fixing the obstruction. Requesting a chest tube is inappropriate as the radiology report shows no evidence of a pneumothorax. Decreasing PEEP would worsen atelectasis by allowing more alveoli to collapse. Pulmonary Embolism is a possible differential, but the prominent coarse crackles and high PIP point more strongly to an airway/secretion issue. CVP is a measure of fluid status and is not a primary parameter for monitoring acute respiratory failure.",
