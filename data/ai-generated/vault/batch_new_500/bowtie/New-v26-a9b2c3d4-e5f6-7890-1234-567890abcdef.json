He stated, \"My head is pounding, and I feel really uneasy.\" B: The patient sustained a T6 spinal cord injury three years ago in a motor vehicle accident. He has a documented history of autonomic dysreflexia episodes. He currently manages his bladder function with intermittent catheterization every six hours. A: At 07:00, the patient's BP is significantly elevated at 210/110 mmHg, with a corresponding decrease in heart rate to 55 bpm. He is diaphoretic above the level of his injury. Examination reveals nasal congestion. His skin below the level of injury is pale and cool to the touch. The patient also reports blurred vision. His last bowel movement was two days ago. O2 saturation is 98% on room air. R: I am highly concerned about a potential episode of autonomic dysreflexia given the patient's history and current presentation. I strongly recommend immediate intervention to lower his blood pressure and identify the underlying cause triggering this episode. I am requesting orders for PRN antihypertensive medication, such as hydralazine, and further assessment for potential bladder or bowel distention as likely culprits.",

        "correct": "The priority action is to elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees or assist the patient to a sitting position to reduce blood pressure. This helps to promote venous pooling and decrease cerebral blood flow. Once the patient is sitting upright, assess for potential causes, starting with bladder distention by checking the catheter for kinks or obstruction. Bladder distention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Finally, the expected outcome is a reduction in blood pressure and resolution of symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia as the triggering stimulus is removed and the body returns to homeostasis.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to elevate the head of the bed immediately can lead to further increases in blood pressure and potentially life-threatening complications, such as stroke or seizure. This is because the body's compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. Delaying assessment for bladder distention can prolong the episode of autonomic dysreflexia if that is the causative factor. The longer the stimulus persists, the greater the risk of complications. Administering medication before identifying and addressing the underlying cause only treats the symptom and doesn't resolve the problem. This can mask the underlying issue and delay appropriate treatment.",
