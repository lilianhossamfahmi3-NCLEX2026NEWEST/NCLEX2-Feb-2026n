Client is a 28-year-old male with a complete T6 spinal cord injury sustained 3 years ago. \nB: History of recurrent urinary tract infections and documented episodes of autonomic dysreflexia, typically triggered by bladder distention. Manages bladder with an intermittent catheterization schedule every 6 hours. Bowel program includes docusate sodium daily. Lives alone in a modified apartment and reports good social support from his adult child who assists with groceries. \nA: Alert and oriented x4. Vital signs stable upon admission. Skin assessment reveals a 3 cm x 3 cm stage 2 pressure injury on the sacrum with a clean, pink wound bed. Lungs clear, abdomen soft. Peripheral pulses 2+ in all extremities. \nR: Continue current intermittent catheterization and bowel regimen. Implement pressure injury prevention protocol. Monitor for signs of infection or autonomic dysreflexia."

Client is diaphoretic with flushed skin above the T6 injury level. Skin below T6 is pale and cool with piloerection. Nasal congestion is noted. No signs of kinked catheter tubing as client does not have an indwelling catheter. \nR: Suspect autonomic dysreflexia. Immediate intervention is required to lower blood pressure and identify the noxious stimulus.
