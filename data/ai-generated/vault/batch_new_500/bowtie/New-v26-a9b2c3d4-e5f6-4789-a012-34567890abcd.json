The elevated BUN and creatinine support this. Insulin and dextrose shift potassium intracellularly, calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) binds potassium in the GI tract for excretion. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage any life-threatening arrhythmias. ClinicalPearl: Always prioritize interventions based on the severity of the electrolyte imbalance and its potential complications.",
        "incorrect": "Focusing solely on lowering blood pressure or administering fluids without addressing the hyperkalemia is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. While loop diuretics can help excrete potassium, they may not be effective in the setting of AKI and can worsen dehydration. Sodium bicarbonate can be used to treat metabolic acidosis associated with renal failure, but it's not a primary treatment for hyperkalemia. Ignoring the underlying cause and potential complications of hyperkalemia can lead to adverse patient outcomes. ClinicalPearl: Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and requires prompt intervention.
