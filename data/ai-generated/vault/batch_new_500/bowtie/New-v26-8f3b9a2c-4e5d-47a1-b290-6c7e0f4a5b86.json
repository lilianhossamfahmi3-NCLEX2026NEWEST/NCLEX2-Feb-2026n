This is evidenced by hypotension (MAP 70 mmHg), tachycardia, cool/clammy skin, bilateral crackles, elevated BNP (650 pg/mL), and oliguria (20 mL/hr). The primary goals are to reduce preload and improve oxygenation. Administering furosemide will reduce the fluid overload causing pulmonary edema. Titrating oxygen will address the hypoxemia. The central condition is cardiogenic shock, where the heart fails as a pump. Consequently, the most critical parameters to monitor are urine output (as an indicator of renal perfusion) and MAP (to assess overall tissue perfusion).",
