Mother is anxious and concerned.\nA: Infant is currently experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell). Respiratory distress is evident. Current interventions include placing the infant in knee-chest position and administering oxygen via face mask. Vital signs are being monitored closely.\nR: Request immediate evaluation by the pediatric cardiologist and respiratory therapy. Prepare for potential administration of morphine sulfate and propranolol as per protocol. Consider fluid bolus if indicated by assessment.",

        "correct": "The infant is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell), a common complication of Tetralogy of Fallot. The priority is to reduce the infant's oxygen demand and increase systemic vascular resistance to shunt blood back to the lungs. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position decreases venous return from the legs, increasing systemic vascular resistance. Administering oxygen can help improve oxygen saturation, although it may not be fully effective due to the right-to-left shunting. Calming the infant reduces oxygen consumption. Morphine can help to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, promoting pulmonary blood flow. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can decrease heart rate and contractility, further reducing oxygen demand.",
        "incorrect": "Monitoring the infant's temperature is important but not the immediate priority during a Tet spell. Preparing the parents for potential surgery is a longer-term consideration but not the immediate action. Administering a fluid bolus may be considered if dehydration is suspected, but the initial focus should be on managing the hypercyanotic spell. Documenting the event is essential but follows the immediate interventions.",
