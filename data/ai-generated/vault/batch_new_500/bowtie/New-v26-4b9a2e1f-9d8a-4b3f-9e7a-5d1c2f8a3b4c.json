        "correct": "The infant's presentation of acute, severe cyanosis and irritability following a crying episode is classic for a hypercyanotic or 'Tet' spell in Tetralogy of Fallot. This is a medical emergency caused by a sudden spasm of the right ventricular outflow tract, which drastically reduces pulmonary blood flow and causes a massive right-to-left shunt of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation. Immediate interventions must aim to reverse this pathophysiology by increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. The knee-chest position increases SVR, while morphine provides sedation to reduce oxygen demand and relax the infundibular spasm. Monitoring oxygen saturation and SVR (via BP and perfusion) are critical to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions.",

This position increases systemic vascular resistance by 'kinking' the femoral arteries, which makes it harder for blood to enter the aorta and preferentially shunts deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary artery, improving oxygenation."

Its primary benefits are sedation, which calms the infant and reduces oxygen consumption, and its effect on relaxing the smooth muscle of the right ventricular infundibulum, which alleviates the spasm and improves blood flow to the lungs."
