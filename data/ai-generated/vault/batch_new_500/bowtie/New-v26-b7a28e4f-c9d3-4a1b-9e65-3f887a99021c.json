The patient expresses feelings of hopelessness and being overwhelmed due to financial strain and relationship issues. He verbalized, 'I just want the pain to stop.'\n\nB: Mr. Doe is a veteran with a history of anxiety but no prior psychiatric admissions. He reportedly took an unknown quantity of acetaminophen approximately four hours before arrival at the hospital. He denies any other substance use.\n\nA: The patient presents as anxious, tearful, and expresses significant hopelessness. Vital signs at 03:15 are: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air, and Temp 98.6°F (37°C). Primary concerns are high suicide risk and potential acetaminophen toxicity.\n\nR: Immediate priorities are initiating suicide precautions to ensure patient safety. Contact the attending provider for orders, including obtaining an acetaminophen level and scheduling an urgent psychiatric consultation. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial to detect any deterioration related to acetaminophen toxicity or escalating suicidal ideation. Provide ongoing emotional support and encourage the patient to express his feelings in a safe and therapeutic environment. Implement strategies to mitigate immediate suicide risk and address underlying psychological distress.",

Establishing suicide precautions, contacting the provider for further orders regarding the acetaminophen overdose and a psychiatric evaluation, and continuous monitoring are crucial. Addressing the patient's expressed feelings of hopelessness is also a critical step in suicide prevention. Continuous monitoring is vital in case of deterioration from acetaminophen toxicity or increased suicidal ideation. Offering emotional support and a safe environment fosters trust and encourages the patient to engage in treatment.",
        "incorrect": "While family notification and medication reconciliation are important, they are not the immediate priority when the patient is at high risk for suicide. Focusing solely on the acetaminophen overdose without addressing the underlying suicidal ideation is inadequate. Delaying the psychiatric consult could prolong the patient's distress and increase the risk of another suicide attempt. Although gathering a full history is important, delaying immediate safety measures to obtain the information is not appropriate.",
