GCS is 6 (E1, V1, M4). BP is 180/100 mmHg. HR is 55 bpm. Temperature is 37.8°C. Mannitol 25g IV was administered at 04:00. Urine output has been minimal since admission.\nR: Anticipate further interventions to manage increased ICP and prevent secondary brain injury. Monitor neurological status closely.

        "correct": "Interventions:\n- Administer stool softener: Prevents straining, which increases ICP. Straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver) can acutely elevate ICP, which is detrimental in a patient with a hemorrhagic stroke and increased ICP. \n- Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees: Promotes venous drainage and reduces ICP. Elevating the head of the bed facilitates venous return from the brain, reducing cerebral blood volume and, consequently, ICP.\n- Monitor serum sodium levels: Hypernatremia can result from mannitol administration and needs correction. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can lead to hypernatremia. Monitoring and correcting sodium levels is crucial to prevent further neurological complications.\nPotential Conditions:\n- Cerebral edema: A common complication following hemorrhagic stroke, contributing to increased ICP. Cerebral edema is a natural consequence of tissue damage from the hemorrhage, leading to increased ICP and potential herniation.\n- Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The primary concern given the patient's presentation and diagnosis, driving many interventions. The patient's decreased level of consciousness, unequal pupils, and CT scan findings all point to significantly elevated ICP, which is life-threatening.\n- Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH): Can occur following brain injury, leading to fluid retention and hyponatremia. While the patient currently has hypernatremia, SIADH is a potential complication that can develop, especially as the body responds to the initial injury and treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions:\n- Administer hypotonic IV fluids: Hypotonic fluids can exacerbate cerebral edema by drawing fluid into brain cells. Hypotonic solutions cause fluid to shift into cells, worsening cerebral edema and increasing ICP.\n- Lower head of bed to supine: Supine position increases ICP by impeding venous drainage. Lying flat impedes venous return from the brain, increasing cerebral blood volume and ICP.\n- Initiate active range of motion exercises: While important long-term, active ROM can increase ICP in the acute phase. Active ROM can increase metabolic demand and potentially elevate ICP in the acute phase of a hemorrhagic stroke.\nPotential Conditions:\n- Hypovolemic shock: Not supported by the patient's current vital signs (BP is elevated, not low). The patient is likely hypervolemic from mannitol administration. The patient's elevated blood pressure and administration of mannitol make hypovolemic shock unlikely.\n- Hypothermia: The patient is currently experiencing a fever, not hypothermia. Inducing hypothermia is sometimes used as a neuroprotective strategy, but is not indicated given the current temperature. The patient's elevated temperature suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory process, making hypothermia an incorrect choice.\n- Spinal Cord Injury: The scenario focuses on a hemorrhagic stroke and increased ICP, with no indication of spinal cord injury. The patient's presentation is consistent with a stroke affecting the brain, not the spinal cord.",
