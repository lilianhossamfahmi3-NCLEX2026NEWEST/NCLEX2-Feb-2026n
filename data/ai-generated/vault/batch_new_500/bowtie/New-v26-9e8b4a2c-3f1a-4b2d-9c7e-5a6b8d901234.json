He is currently prescribed furosemide 40mg IV BID. There's no known history of airborne illnesses, but presenting symptoms warrant precaution.\nA: At 07:00, the patient reported increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. Vitals: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Crackles were auscultated bilaterally. Urine output since admission is 150 mL. Potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L. A productive cough was noted, and a sputum culture is pending.\nR: The provider was notified at 07:15 and ordered a repeat dose of furosemide 40mg IV stat and a potassium chloride (KCl) infusion of 20 mEq in 100 mL NS over 2 hours. Implement airborne isolation precautions. Closely monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and urine output. Awaiting further orders based on sputum culture results.",

        "correct": "Administer potassium chloride (KCl) infusion as prescribed: The patient's potassium level is low (3.2 mEq/L), increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Rapid potassium correction is essential, but it must be administered safely. Monitor the patient for signs of hypokalemia: Recognizing and documenting signs of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness, cramps, or cardiac arrhythmias, is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the potassium replacement therapy. Administer furosemide 40 mg IV stat as prescribed: The patient is experiencing acute heart failure exacerbation with signs of fluid overload. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that will help reduce fluid volume. Monitor urine output frequently: Furosemide's effectiveness is determined by urine output. Monitoring output helps assess whether the medication is achieving the desired effect. Assess the patient's respiratory status: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated (28 bpm) and SpO2 is low (90% on 2L NC), indicating respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring is crucial. Implement Airborne Precautions: Given the patient's productive cough, initiate airborne isolation to prevent potential spread of infection. Use appropriate PPE, including an N95 respirator. Document vital signs and patient response to interventions: Accurate and timely documentation is essential for tracking the patient's progress and ensuring continuity of care. This information informs future interventions and adjustments to the treatment plan. Initiate cardiac monitoring: Due to the risk of arrhythmias from electrolyte imbalances and heart failure, continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.",
        "incorrect": "Discontinue furosemide: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, and furosemide is necessary to reduce fluid volume. Hold potassium chloride (KCl) infusion: The patient is hypokalemic, and potassium replacement is crucial. Administer furosemide via IM route: Furosemide is best administered intravenously for rapid and predictable absorption in an acute situation. Encourage oral fluid intake: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, and encouraging oral fluid intake will worsen the condition. Encourage ambulation: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and is not stable for ambulation. Decrease oxygen flow rate: The patient's SpO2 is low, and decreasing the oxygen flow rate will worsen hypoxemia. Administer IV fluids rapidly: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, and administering IV fluids will worsen the condition. Educate the patient about the importance of dietary potassium: While important for long-term management, it is not the immediate priority.",
