This is evidenced by worsening dyspnea, crackles, JVD, and the chest x-ray findings. The two most critical actions are to administer IV furosemide to promote rapid diuresis and reduce preload, and to administer IV potassium chloride to correct the critical hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), which is exacerbated by the diuretic and poses a high risk for fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Consequently, the two most important parameters to monitor are urine output, to evaluate the effectiveness of the furosemide, and the cardiac rhythm, to detect any arrhythmias caused by the electrolyte imbalance.",
