        "correct": "The correct answers reflect the prioritization of safety, assessment, and intervention in a suicidal patient. Implementing suicide precautions is paramount. Assessing the patient's mental status and suicidal risk factors provides crucial information for treatment planning. Monitoring vital signs and medication effects ensures physical safety and therapeutic response. The potential conditions include Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder, all consistent with the presented symptoms and history. Parameters to monitor include mood and affect, suicidal ideation, and vital signs, as these can fluctuate rapidly in a crisis situation. This holistic approach ensures patient safety and informs appropriate interventions. \n\nclinicalPearl: Continuous observation is crucial to prevent self-harm. A no-harm contract can be useful, but it is not a substitute for continuous monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of the urgency of the situation or a misprioritization of nursing actions. For example, delaying suicide precautions or focusing solely on medication without addressing the underlying emotional distress are inappropriate. Failing to recognize potential co-morbid conditions or neglecting to monitor key parameters could lead to adverse outcomes. Overlooking the patient's emotional state or minimizing the risk of suicide is a critical error.\n\nclinicalPearl: Asking directly about suicidal thoughts does not increase the risk of suicide; it is an essential part of the assessment.",
