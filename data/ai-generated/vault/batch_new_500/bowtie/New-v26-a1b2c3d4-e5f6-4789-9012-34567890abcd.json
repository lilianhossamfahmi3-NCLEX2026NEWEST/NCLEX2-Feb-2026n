B: Admitted for acute pancreatitis; lab results show elevated amylase (2500 U/L) and lipase (3800 U/L). Suspect early liver failure due to elevated bilirubin (3.2 mg/dL) and prolonged PT/INR (INR 1.8). Patient also has a productive cough with thick yellow sputum. A: Patient reports pain 8/10. Vitals: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.9°C. Abdomen distended, tender to palpation. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. Patient is confused and disoriented. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in both lungs. Suspect possible pneumonia. R: Anticipate need for increased respiratory support, fluid resuscitation, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as ARDS, sepsis, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient requires airborne isolation precautions pending further investigation of respiratory status. Notify provider of decreased urine output, change in mental status, and respiratory distress. Obtain sputum culture. Initiate antibiotic therapy as prescribed.",

    "correct": "Acute Pancreatitis: The primary nursing action is to provide pain management with analgesics like morphine, as severe abdominal pain is a hallmark symptom. Potential complications include ARDS due to the inflammatory process and fluid shifts. Hepatic Encephalopathy (Early Stage): Administering lactulose helps reduce ammonia levels, which are elevated due to impaired liver function. A potential complication is altered mental status due to increased ammonia. Hypovolemic Shock: Fluid resuscitation with normal saline is crucial to address hypovolemia caused by third spacing and decreased oral intake. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Decreased urine output indicates worsening renal perfusion and potential renal failure.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding pain medication in acute pancreatitis is incorrect and inhumane, as pain management is a priority. Lactulose is specifically for hepatic encephalopathy, not pancreatitis pain. Monitoring blood glucose is important but not the most immediate action for pancreatitis pain. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in hypovolemic shock. Monitoring liver enzymes, while important for assessing liver function, is not the immediate intervention needed for hypovolemic shock. Administering antibiotics without evidence of infection is inappropriate and can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Elevating the head of the bed might help with respiratory distress but doesn't directly address the primary issue of fluid volume deficit in hypovolemic shock.",
