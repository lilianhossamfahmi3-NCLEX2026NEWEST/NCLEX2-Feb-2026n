ARDS is a potential complication due to the inflammatory process and fluid shifts. Hepatic Encephalopathy (Early Stage): Lactulose reduces ammonia levels elevated due to impaired liver function. Altered mental status is a potential complication of increased ammonia. Hypovolemic Shock: Normal saline bolus addresses hypovolemia from third spacing and decreased intake. Decreased urine output indicates worsening renal perfusion and potential renal failure.",
        "incorrect": "Withholding pain medication in acute pancreatitis is incorrect; pain management is a priority. Lactulose is for hepatic encephalopathy, not pancreatitis pain. Monitoring blood glucose is important but not the most immediate action for pancreatitis pain. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in hypovolemic shock. Monitoring liver enzymes, while important for assessing liver function, is not the immediate intervention needed for hypovolemic shock. Administering antibiotics without evidence of infection is inappropriate and can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Elevating the head of the bed might help with respiratory distress but doesn't directly address the primary issue of fluid volume deficit in hypovolemic shock.",
