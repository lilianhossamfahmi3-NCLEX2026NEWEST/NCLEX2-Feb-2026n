His current medications include lisinopril 20mg daily, metformin 500mg twice daily, and furosemide 40mg daily. The physician orders an intravenous (IV) infusion of dobutamine at 5 mcg/kg/min to improve cardiac output. The pharmacy provides a dobutamine solution of 500 mg in 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. Mr. Jones weighs 200 lbs. Use the bowtie format to address the following aspects of Mr. Jones' care regarding the dobutamine infusion.",

At 06:00, he reported increased shortness of breath and palpitations. His BP was 160/90 at 05:00, now 170/100. HR increased from 110 to 120, and RR from 24 to 28. SpO2 decreased from 92% to 90% on 2L NC. Crackles are auscultated bilaterally.\nB: He has a history of HTN, DM2, and CKD. His medications include lisinopril, metformin, and furosemide.\nA: He is receiving furosemide IV and dobutamine at 5 mcg/kg/min. He exhibits signs of worsening heart failure, possibly related to the dobutamine infusion and/or fluid overload. His weight is 200 lbs. Labs show elevated potassium (5.8 mEq/L) and creatinine (2.5 mg/dL).\nR: I need guidance on managing the dobutamine infusion and addressing his worsening condition. Consider adjusting the infusion rate, obtaining further orders, and addressing the elevated potassium level.",

The initial action should be to slow or stop the infusion. Calculating the correct infusion rate is essential for patient safety. The physician needs to be notified promptly about the patient's status change and the actions taken. Continuously monitoring the patient's vital signs is critical to assess the response to the changes in the infusion rate and other interventions. Lastly, documenting the patient's status, the interventions performed, and the patient's response is crucial for maintaining a clear and accurate record of care. An elevated potassium level should also be addressed but it is not the priority.",

Some options suggest actions that are within the scope of practice but not the priority action, such as obtaining an EKG. Other options suggest actions outside the scope of nursing practice, such as ordering new medications. Some actions like contacting the rapid response team might be necessary later but are not the initial, most critical steps.",
