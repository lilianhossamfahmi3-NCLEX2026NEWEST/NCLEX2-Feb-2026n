Comorbidities include HTN, T2DM, and CKD. A dobutamine infusion was initiated at 04:00 at 5 mcg/kg/min to improve cardiac output. The client lives alone in a third-floor apartment with no elevator, which he states is a barrier to attending follow-up appointments and accessing fresh groceries.\nA: Client is alert, oriented, and visibly anxious. Respiratory rate is 28/min with use of accessory muscles. SpO2 has decreased from 92% to 90% on 2L NC. BP has trended up to 170/100 mmHg, and heart rate is now 120/min. Auscultation reveals worsening bilateral crackles extending to the mid-lung fields. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).\nR: Immediate intervention required for suspected adverse reaction to dobutamine. Will notify provider of significant change in cardiovascular status and await further orders. Continue close hemodynamic monitoring."

Dobutamine is a beta-1 adrenergic agonist that increases heart rate and contractility. In this vulnerable client, the infusion has caused excessive cardiac stimulation, leading to increased myocardial oxygen demand and precipitating myocardial ischemia and worsening heart failure. The priority is to remove the cause by stopping the infusion. The nurse must then immediately notify the provider for further orders. The most critical parameters to monitor are those directly affected by the drug: heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure, to evaluate the client's response to stopping the infusion.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen or administering morphine treats the symptoms (hypoxia, anxiety) but fails to address the iatrogenic cause of the deterioration, which is the dobutamine infusion. Requesting an ECG is appropriate but is secondary to stopping the infusion that is causing harm. The clinical picture is not consistent with an anaphylactic reaction (no rash, stridor, or angioedema) or a pulmonary embolism. While renal function and urine output are important in heart failure, they are not the immediate priority parameters to monitor for an acute tachydysrhythmic event caused by a vasoactive medication.",
