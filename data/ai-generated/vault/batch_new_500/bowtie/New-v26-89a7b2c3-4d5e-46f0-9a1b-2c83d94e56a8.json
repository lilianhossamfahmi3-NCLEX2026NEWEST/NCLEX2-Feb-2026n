He is currently expressing active suicidal ideation with a plan.\nB: Patient has a combat deployment history resulting in chronic pain and PTSD. He has struggled with social isolation and difficulty adjusting to civilian life since discharge, a significant social determinant of health. He has a history of inconsistent engagement with outpatient mental health services. His friend found him unresponsive and called emergency services.\nA: On ED arrival at 02:00, GCS was 8. He was lethargic with shallow respirations. Naloxone 0.4 mg IM was administered with improvement in consciousness. Vitals are stabilizing but he remains at risk for respiratory depression. He verbalizes feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.\nR: Maintain strict suicide precautions, including one-to-one observation. Continue cardiorespiratory monitoring. Prepare for potential administration of activated charcoal per toxicology consult. Obtain a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to guide treatment."
