B: Sergeant Miller is a veteran with a history of PTSD, depression, and chronic pain related to combat deployment. He's prescribed oxycodone for pain. He has a history of non-adherence to mental health treatment. A: Upon arrival, he was lethargic, responding only to painful stimuli. Naloxone was administered, restoring consciousness. He admitted to ingesting an entire bottle of oxycodone and is currently expressing suicidal ideation with a plan. Vitals: HR 110 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 24 breaths/min and shallow, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 99.8°F (37.7°C). Labs reveal elevated oxycodone levels. At 02:45, he was medically cleared and transferred to the psychiatric unit. R: Continue close monitoring of vital signs and mental status. Maintain suicide precautions. Consult psychiatry for further evaluation and management. Consider a toxicology screen to rule out polysubstance abuse. Initiate a thorough mental health assessment. Reassess pain management strategies.",

The opioid overdose, coupled with expressed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, points towards Major Depressive Disorder. The recent suicide attempt and explicit suicidal ideation with a plan indicate a high Suicide Risk.\n\nNursing Actions: Implementing suicide precautions is the immediate priority to ensure the patient's safety. This includes removing potential hazards and maintaining continuous observation. Notifying the psychiatric provider is crucial for collaborative care and potential adjustments to the treatment plan. Initiating a comprehensive mental health assessment will provide a deeper understanding of the patient's history, current mental state, and specific needs.\n\nParameters to Monitor: Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential due to the recent opioid overdose and potential for delayed respiratory depression or other complications. Frequent assessment of the patient's mental status, including suicidal ideation, mood, and cognitive function, is critical for detecting changes in risk. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal is important, as abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the priority assessments and interventions for a patient at immediate risk of suicide following an overdose. Failing to recognize PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, or Suicide Risk as potential conditions indicates a lack of understanding of the diagnostic criteria and risk factors.

Incorrect parameters to monitor suggest a failure to recognize the potential physiological and psychological consequences of the overdose and underlying mental health conditions.",
