This condition is a state of severe cardiac pump failure leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The primary goals are to improve cardiac output and maintain organ perfusion. Initiating a vasopressor like norepinephrine is critical to increase systemic vascular resistance and raise the MAP to a level (>65 mmHg) that can perfuse vital organs. The client's respiratory distress, hypoxemia (SpO2 90% on 6L NC), and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.30, PaCO2 50) indicate impending respiratory failure, making preparation for intubation a priority to secure the airway and reduce the work of breathing. Continuous monitoring of MAP and PAWP is essential to guide therapy and assess response.",
