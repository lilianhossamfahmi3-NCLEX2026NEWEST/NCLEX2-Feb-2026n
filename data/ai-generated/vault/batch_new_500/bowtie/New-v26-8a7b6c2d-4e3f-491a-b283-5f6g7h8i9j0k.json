Allergic to Penicillin.\nA: At 04:15, client is lethargic, not oriented to time or place. BP 88/52 mmHg (MAP 64), HR 122 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO₂ 90% on 2L NC, Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C). Skin is warm and flushed with delayed capillary refill >3 seconds. Coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. An indwelling urinary catheter inserted in ED has drained 20 mL of cloudy, foul-smelling urine in the last hour.\nR: Initiate sepsis protocol immediately. Obtain blood cultures prior to administering broad-spectrum antibiotics. Start 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus for hypotension. Continue close hemodynamic monitoring and titrate oxygen."

The pathophysiology involves systemic inflammation leading to massive vasodilation and capillary leakage, causing distributive shock and tissue hypoperfusion. Immediate priorities are to control the source of infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics and restore tissue perfusion. Since the client remains hypotensive after initial fluid administration, initiating a vasopressor like norepinephrine is critical to increase systemic vascular resistance and achieve a target MAP of ≥65 mmHg. Monitoring MAP and serum lactate provides real-time feedback on the effectiveness of these life-saving interventions.",
