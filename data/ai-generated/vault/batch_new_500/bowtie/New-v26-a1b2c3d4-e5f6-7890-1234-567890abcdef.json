B: Admitted for acute MI. Troponin T peaked at 3.5 ng/mL. EKG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. A: Currently, at 10:30, patient is restless, diaphoretic, and complaining of shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min. Crackles auscultated bilaterally. Has received morphine 4mg IV at 08:30 and 10:00. Furosemide 40mg IV was given at 09:00. UOP is minimal (10ml over the last hour). A central line was placed.

    "correct": "The patient is experiencing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) secondary to an MI, complicated by hypovolemia and potential cardiogenic shock. The low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, respiratory distress, and poor oxygen saturation indicate inadequate tissue perfusion. Addressing oxygenation is paramount, followed by cautious fluid resuscitation to improve cardiac output without exacerbating pulmonary edema. Vasopressors may be necessary to support blood pressure. Addressing the underlying potassium and sodium imbalances is crucial. Continuous monitoring is vital to detect further deterioration or complications such as arrhythmias or worsening renal function.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen administration in a patient with critical hypoxia can lead to irreversible organ damage or death. Aggressive fluid resuscitation without hemodynamic monitoring could worsen pulmonary edema and compromise respiratory function. Ignoring electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia and hyponatremia, can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and neurological complications. Overlooking the decreased urinary output can lead to further renal damage. Focusing solely on pain management without addressing the underlying cardiovascular instability is inappropriate.",
