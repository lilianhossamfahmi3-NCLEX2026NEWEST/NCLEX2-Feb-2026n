He was admitted at 08:00 with an NSTEMI, which evolved to a STEMI. Initial troponin was 3.5 ng/mL. He received furosemide 40 mg IV at 09:00 with minimal effect; urine output is only 10 mL in the past hour.\n\nA: Vital signs at 10:30 are BP 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63), HR 110 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO2 88% on 2L NC. Auscultation reveals worsening bilateral crackles. The client is restless and cool to the touch. Labs show hypokalemia and hyponatremia.\n\nR: The client is progressing into cardiogenic shock.

Onset was approximately 3 hours ago.\n\nB: Client has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, with poor adherence to medications. He lives alone and reports difficulty accessing his pharmacy and affording fresh produce, relying on canned goods. His last MI was two years ago. He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.\n\nA: Initial vitals: BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, RR 20/min, SpO2 95% on room air. ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Client is alert, oriented, and anxious. Skin is pale and cool. Initial labs drawn and sent. IV access established.\n\nR: Plan is to stabilize the client, manage pain with morphine, administer antiplatelet therapy, and prepare for cardiac catheterization. Will initiate continuous cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring.\n\nProgress Note (10:30):\nS: Client's condition has acutely deteriorated over the last hour. He is now reporting severe dyspnea, stating, \"I can't catch my breath.\"\n\nB: Since the 09:00 dose of furosemide 40 mg IV, urine output has been negligible (10 mL). He received a second dose of morphine at 10:00 with no relief of dyspnea.\n\nA: Vitals: BP 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63), HR 110 bpm (sinus tachycardia), RR 28/min, SpO2 88% on 2L NC. Client is restless, confused, and diaphoretic with cool, clammy extremities. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles throughout all lung fields. JVD is present at 45 degrees.\n\nR: This presentation is highly indicative of cardiogenic shock. Have notified the provider and the rapid response team. Recommend immediate escalation of care, including vasopressor support and possible mechanical ventilation."

This is a state of end-organ hypoperfusion caused by cardiac pump failure. The primary goal is to improve cardiac output and maintain vital organ perfusion. Norepinephrine, a potent vasopressor, increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, thereby restoring perfusion to critical organs like the brain and kidneys. This is the most critical life-saving intervention.",
