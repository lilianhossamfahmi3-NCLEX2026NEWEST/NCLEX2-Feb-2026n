The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a prior MI two years ago. B: He was admitted for an acute MI. His Troponin T peaked at 3.5 ng/mL. The EKG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. A: At 10:30, the patient is restless, diaphoretic, and complaining of significant shortness of breath. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. His BP is 90/50 mmHg, HR is 110 bpm, and RR is 28 breaths/min. Crackles are auscultated bilaterally. He received morphine 4mg IV at 08:30 and 10:00, and furosemide 40mg IV at 09:00. His urinary output has been minimal (10ml over the last hour). A central line has been placed. Labs are concerning for hypokalemia and hyponatremia. R: The patient requires immediate evaluation and intervention. Be prepared to address potential complications related to ADHF and cardiogenic shock.",

        "correct": "The patient is experiencing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) secondary to an MI, potentially complicated by cardiogenic shock. The low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, respiratory distress, and poor oxygen saturation indicate inadequate tissue perfusion. Administering supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is paramount to improve oxygenation. A cautious fluid bolus may be necessary to improve cardiac output, but it must be carefully monitored to avoid exacerbating pulmonary edema. Vasopressors may be required to support blood pressure if fluid resuscitation is insufficient. Addressing the underlying potassium and sodium imbalances is crucial to stabilize cardiac function. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect arrhythmias or further deterioration. Preparing for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation is necessary given the patient's respiratory distress. An ECG is needed to assess for ongoing ischemia or new arrhythmias. Pericardiocentesis is less likely but considered due to hypotension.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen administration in a patient with critical hypoxia can lead to irreversible organ damage or death. Aggressive fluid resuscitation without hemodynamic monitoring could worsen pulmonary edema and compromise respiratory function. Ignoring electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia and hyponatremia, can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and neurological complications. Overlooking the decreased urinary output can lead to further renal damage. Focusing solely on pain management without addressing the underlying cardiovascular instability is inappropriate. Administering metoprolol IV push in the setting of hypotension can further compromise cardiac output.",
