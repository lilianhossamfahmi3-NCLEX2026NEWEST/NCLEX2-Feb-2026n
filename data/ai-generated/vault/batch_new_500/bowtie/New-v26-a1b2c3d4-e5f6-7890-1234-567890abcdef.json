O: Increased WOB: nasal flaring, grunting, retractions. RR 68, HR 180, SpO2 88% on room air. Cap refill 4 seconds. Auscultation reveals a loud holosystolic murmur and crackles bilaterally. Mother reports poor feeding for 2 days, only taking 1-2 oz per feeding. Diaphoresis noted with minimal activity. B: VSD diagnosed at 2 months. Home medications: Furosemide 2 mg PO BID. Last dose given at 06:00. A: Suspect worsening heart failure secondary to VSD. Needs immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and reduce cardiac workload. R: Orders pending. Requesting STAT CXR and ABGs. Plan to administer oxygen via nasal cannula, elevate HOB, and notify the cardiologist.",

    "correct": "The infant presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure secondary to VSD. Administering oxygen, elevating the HOB, and administering diuretics are appropriate interventions to improve oxygenation, reduce preload, and decrease cardiac workload. Monitoring potassium is crucial due to the potassium-wasting effect of furosemide, which, if exacerbated by poor intake, could lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Restricting fluids is usually a component of heart failure management, however, given the infant's poor intake and elevated BUN/Creatinine, this should be done cautiously and in conjunction with the provider. The infant is in heart failure, secondary to a VSD, evidenced by the increased respiratory rate, retractions, murmur, and decreased oxygen saturation. The expected outcomes include improved oxygen saturation, decreased respiratory effort, and improved fluid balance. The rationale for each is further detailed below.",
    "incorrect": "Options that do not directly address the immediate needs of the infant, such as administering digoxin without a specific order or focusing solely on family education without stabilizing the patient, are incorrect. Additionally, not recognizing the potential for hypokalemia from diuretic therapy and the need for careful fluid management in the context of poor intake and elevated BUN/Creatinine are incorrect. Attributing the symptoms to solely a respiratory infection without considering the cardiac component is also incorrect. Finally, selecting interventions that are not aligned with the identified conditions (e.g., improved growth velocity when immediate respiratory support is needed) are also incorrect.",
