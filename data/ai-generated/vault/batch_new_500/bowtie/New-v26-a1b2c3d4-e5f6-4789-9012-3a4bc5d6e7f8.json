Mother is anxious about 'blue spells.' A: Currently, the infant is irritable and cyanotic. Oxygen administered via nasal cannula at 1 L/min, SpO2 now 85%. Auscultated a loud systolic murmur. IV access established. Morphine sulfate administered as prescribed for severe cyanotic episode. R: Anticipate further cyanotic episodes. Need to monitor respiratory status closely, prevent prolonged crying, and prepare for potential surgical intervention.

        "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate priorities for managing a cyanotic episode ('tet spell') in an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood in the heart, thereby improving oxygen saturation. Administering morphine sulfate helps to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance, interrupting the positive feedback loop that perpetuates the cyanotic episode. Assessing the infant's respiratory status is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of the interventions and to detect any signs of respiratory distress. Preparing for potential surgical intervention is a long-term consideration but not the immediate priority during an acute cyanotic episode. Finally, educating the parents about home care strategies is important but should be addressed after the immediate crisis is resolved. Administering oxygen is a supportive measure, but not the priority.",
        "incorrect": "Reordering these actions will result in a suboptimal response to the cyanotic episode. For example, delaying the knee-chest position or morphine administration prolongs the cyanotic episode and increases the risk of complications. Focusing on parental education before stabilizing the infant is inappropriate. Prioritizing surgical planning over immediate interventions fails to address the acute needs of the patient. Failing to adequately assess respiratory status could lead to unrecognized respiratory compromise. Administering oxygen alone will not resolve the underlying issue.",
