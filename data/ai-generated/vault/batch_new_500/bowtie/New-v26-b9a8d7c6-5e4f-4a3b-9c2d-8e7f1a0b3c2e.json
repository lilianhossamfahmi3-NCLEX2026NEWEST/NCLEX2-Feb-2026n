The patient has a history of COPD and a recent UTI treated with ciprofloxacin.\nB: His vital signs include a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Urine output has been 20 mL/hr for the last 2 hours. The patient has a documented penicillin allergy; however, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) was administered at 04:00.\nA: Sepsis is suspected secondary to pneumonia. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and chest X-ray have been obtained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) were initiated per sepsis protocol. The patient is hypotensive and requires fluid resuscitation.\nR: Continue to closely monitor vital signs and administer fluid resuscitation as prescribed. Assess the patient's response to treatment and administer medications as ordered. Immediately notify the provider regarding the administration of Zosyn, given the reported penicillin allergy. Anticipate the potential need for vasopressors if hypotension persists.",
