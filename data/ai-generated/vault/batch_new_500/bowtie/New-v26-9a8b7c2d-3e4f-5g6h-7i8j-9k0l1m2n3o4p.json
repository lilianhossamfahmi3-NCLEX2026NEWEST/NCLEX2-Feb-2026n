The pathophysiology involves a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to widespread vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and maldistribution of blood flow. This results in profound tissue hypoperfusion. The priority actions are to restore intravascular volume with a 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus and to treat the underlying infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Monitoring Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is critical to assess perfusion to vital organs, and serial serum lactate levels are essential to evaluate the body's response to resuscitation and the clearance of metabolic acidosis from tissue hypoxia.",
