He is stationed over 2,000 miles from his family, a significant social determinant of health impacting his support system. He admits to consuming two beers approximately four hours ago but denies other substance use. No prior psychiatric history is reported.\n\nAssessment: Client is alert and oriented x4, with a distraught and tearful affect. He is observed pacing in the room. Mood is described as 'hopeless.' The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is positive for suicidal ideation with a potential method identified, but he denies immediate intent or a specific plan. Vitals are stable.\n\nRecommendation: Initiate immediate one-to-one observation and full suicide precautions. Place a STAT consult to psychiatry. Ensure a safe environment by removing all personal belongings and potential ligature risks. Maintain NPO status pending psychiatric evaluation."
