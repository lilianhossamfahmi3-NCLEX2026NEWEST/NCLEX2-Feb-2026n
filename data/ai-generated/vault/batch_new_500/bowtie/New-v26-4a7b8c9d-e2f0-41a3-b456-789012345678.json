    "correct": "The client's stated feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation require immediate intervention to ensure his safety. Establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial to building trust and encouraging the client to share his feelings. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate intervention if the client's condition deteriorates. The client's condition is categorized as acute suicidal ideation based on his expressed thoughts of self-harm and emotional distress. Providing a safe environment minimizes the risk of self-harm. Initiating suicide precautions, such as removing potentially harmful objects, is essential to ensure the client's safety. Notifying the psychiatric provider ensures that a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan are developed promptly.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying intervention or failing to provide a safe environment could have devastating consequences. Dismissing the client's feelings as simply sadness or downplaying the risk of suicide is inappropriate. Reassurance without addressing the underlying issues is ineffective and potentially harmful. While further assessment is needed, immediate action is paramount. Leaving the client unattended is a safety risk.",
