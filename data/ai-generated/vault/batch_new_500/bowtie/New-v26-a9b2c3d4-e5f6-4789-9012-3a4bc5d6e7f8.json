The physician ordered oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%, continuous ECG monitoring, aspirin 325mg PO, metoprolol 5mg IV every 5 minutes x 3 doses if SBP > 100, and nitroglycerin IV drip starting at 5 mcg/min titrated to effect.

Administering metoprolol would further decrease his blood pressure and is contraindicated with current vital signs. Titrating the nitroglycerin drip as ordered, after fluid resuscitation, would improve myocardial oxygen supply and decrease preload. Administering a fluid bolus is important to increase preload and improve blood pressure, which is essential to avoid further compromising cardiac output. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure is crucial as the patient already has bibasilar crackles and hypotension, indicating possible cardiogenic shock. Contacting the physician to report the hypotension and discuss further management, especially the metoprolol order, is a priority.",

Continuing the nitroglycerin drip at the current rate without addressing the hypotension may exacerbate hypotension and compromise coronary perfusion. Delaying fluid resuscitation could lead to cardiogenic shock. Not monitoring for worsening heart failure delays intervention and can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
