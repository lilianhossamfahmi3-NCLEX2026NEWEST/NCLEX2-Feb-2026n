He is struggling to adjust to civilian life after returning from deployment. Background: SGT Miller's deployment involved combat exposure. He reports frequent flashbacks, disturbing nightmares, and difficulty concentrating, impacting his daily functioning. He feels increasingly isolated from family and friends.

He denies substance use. Recommendation: Initiate continuous suicide precautions. Consult the psychiatric team for evaluation and treatment plan refinement. Monitor vitals and medication effectiveness (Sertraline). Provide a structured, safe environment to promote stabilization and treatment engagement.

        "correct": "Implementing suicide precautions ensures patient safety by minimizing access to harmful objects and providing continuous monitoring. Assessing the patient's coping mechanisms helps identify strengths and weaknesses in managing distress and tailor interventions. A psychiatric consult is crucial for comprehensive evaluation, differential diagnosis, and development of an individualized treatment plan. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common in veterans and can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, aligning with the patient's history and symptoms. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and impaired functioning, all of which are evident in the patient's presentation. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) can occur after a traumatic event and involves symptoms similar to PTSD but within a shorter timeframe (3 days to 1 month); given the recent deployment and symptom presentation, ASD should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nclinicalPearl: Prioritize safety, assess coping, consult psych team.",
        "incorrect": "Initiating group therapy may not be appropriate at this acute stage, as the patient requires individual attention, stabilization, and processing of trauma. Encouraging physical activity, while beneficial long-term, is not the immediate priority when addressing acute suicidal ideation. While substance abuse can exacerbate mental health issues, the patient's urine drug screen was negative, making Substance Use Disorder less likely as the primary diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms following deployment and the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes in the patient's history. Schizophrenia is unlikely given the lack of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and the presence of a clear triggering event (deployment). Adjustment disorder, while possible, is less likely given the severity of the suicidal ideation, the presence of flashbacks, and the significant functional impairment; PTSD, MDD, and ASD are more fitting diagnoses based on the clinical picture.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rule out other disorders based on symptom presentation.",
