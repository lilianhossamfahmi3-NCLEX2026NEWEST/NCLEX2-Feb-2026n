A blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg, headache, and blurred vision are signs of severe preeclampsia. A boggy fundus and moderate lochia with clots can indicate postpartum hemorrhage. A platelet count of 140,000/μL is low and can be indicative of HELLP syndrome. Urine output of 80mL over 4 hours is indicative of oliguria. Deep tendon reflexes of +3 indicate hyperreflexia, a sign of central nervous system irritability associated with preeclampsia.",

While hemoglobin and hematocrit are low, they are expected findings postpartum and not immediately life-threatening in this context unless the patient shows signs of hypovolemic shock. The anxiety is related to the patient's overall condition but is not a primary finding requiring immediate intervention. Elevated AST/ALT/BUN/Creatinine should be noted, but not the first priority. SpO2 of 95% is acceptable.",
