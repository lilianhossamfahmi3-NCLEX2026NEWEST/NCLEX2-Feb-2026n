Tachycardia (HR 120) is a compensatory mechanism for decreased blood pressure and volume. Tachypnea (RR 28) may indicate pain, anxiety, or respiratory distress secondary to fluid accumulation. Low SpO2 (92% on 2L NC) reveals impaired gas exchange and potential respiratory compromise. Low urine output (20 mL/hr) indicates inadequate renal perfusion, likely due to hypovolemia.",
        "incorrect": "Agitation, while concerning, is a subjective symptom that requires further investigation but isn't immediately life-threatening like the vital sign abnormalities. Diminished bowel sounds are expected with pancreatitis due to pancreatic inflammation and ileus. Elevated amylase and lipase levels confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but are not findings requiring *immediate* intervention. Hyperglycemia is common in acute pancreatitis due to insulin deficiency and requires management, but is not as critical as addressing hemodynamic instability. Elevated WBC is indicative of inflammation but is not the highest priority.",
