Oliguria (20 mL/hr) signals acute kidney injury from poor perfusion. Severe hypocalcemia (7.0 mg/dL) is a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance that can cause cardiac dysrhythmias and tetany. These findings require immediate fluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction to prevent multi-organ failure.",
