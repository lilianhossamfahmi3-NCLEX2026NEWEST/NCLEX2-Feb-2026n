B: Central line in place for antibiotics. At 16:00, redness and purulent drainage noted at insertion site, suggesting central line infection. Blood cultures pending. A: At 17:15, BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 32 bpm. SpO2 90% on 6L nasal cannula. Temperature 39.3°C (102.8°F). Lactate 4.1 mmol/L. Urine output 20 mL/hr. WBC 18,000/µL. Mental status altered. R: Highly concerned about sepsis progressing to septic shock, likely secondary to central line infection. Recommend immediate intervention: aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors for BP support, repeat blood cultures. Consider central line removal to mitigate further infection and improve prognosis.",

For example, Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic and its administration is not a sign of septic shock, but rather a treatment attempt. Similarly, pending blood cultures and elevated WBCs are indicators of infection, but not necessarily shock. Elevated creatinine suggests possible kidney injury, but is not an immediate indicator of shock.",
