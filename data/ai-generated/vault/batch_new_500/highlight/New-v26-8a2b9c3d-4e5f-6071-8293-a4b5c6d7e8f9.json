    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 72-year-old male, was admitted three days ago for pneumonia and is now exhibiting increased respiratory distress and altered mental status. His condition is concerning, and I suspect he may be developing septic shock. B: The patient has a central line in place for antibiotic administration. At 16:00, redness and purulent drainage were noted at the insertion site, suggesting a possible central line infection. Recent blood cultures are pending, but the site presentation raises concern. A: Currently, the patient is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg, a heart rate of 122 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 32 bpm. His SpO2 is 90% on 6L nasal cannula. Temperature is elevated at 102.8°F (39.3°C). Lactate level is 4.1 mmol/L, indicating potential tissue hypoxia. Urine output is low at 20 mL/hr, and the WBC count is elevated at 18,000/µL. R: I am highly concerned about sepsis progressing to septic shock, likely secondary to a central line infection. I strongly recommend immediate intervention, including aggressive fluid resuscitation, initiation of vasopressors to support blood pressure, and repeating blood cultures to confirm the source of infection. Central line removal should be considered promptly to mitigate the risk of further infection and improve the patient's overall prognosis.",
