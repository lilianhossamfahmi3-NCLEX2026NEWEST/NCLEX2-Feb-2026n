These indicate worsening hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis despite increased oxygen support. The increasing RR and elevated temperature further suggest infection and increased metabolic demand. Hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate indicate potential septic shock. The ABG values confirm acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, reflecting a failure of the current ventilation strategy.",
        "incorrect": "Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin administration at 08:00 are part of the patient's established treatment plan for pneumonia and do not indicate acute deterioration. While pantoprazole is important for GERD management, it doesn't directly reflect the acute respiratory decline. A WBC of 18,000/mm3 is elevated, but it was likely elevated at baseline due to the pneumonia. It doesn't represent an acute change without trending data. Furosemide and Morphine are PRN medications and their absence doesn't indicate deterioration.",
