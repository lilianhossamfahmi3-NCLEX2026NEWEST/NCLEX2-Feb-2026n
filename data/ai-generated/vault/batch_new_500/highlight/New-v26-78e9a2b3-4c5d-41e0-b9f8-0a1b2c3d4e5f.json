B: Daughter reports Ms. Vance has been increasingly confused and lethargic for the past 3 days. She has been eating poorly and drinking less. A: On arrival, patient is lethargic, but arousable to painful stimuli. Initial vital signs: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 130 bpm, RR 32 and deep, Temp 95.5°F (35.3°C), SpO2 92% on room air. Glucose reading via glucometer is >600 mg/dL (lab confirmation pending). Urine dipstick is positive for ketones. P: I have started an IV of 0.9% normal saline at 200 mL/hr per protocol. I am concerned about possible DKA/HHS and the patient's deteriorating mental status and low temperature. I request an order for stat lab draws, including a complete metabolic panel, blood gases, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Considering fluid resuscitation and potential insulin therapy.",

    "correct": "A blood glucose level >600 mg/dL indicates severe hyperglycemia, requiring immediate intervention to prevent further complications such as HHS. A temperature of 95.5°F (35.3°C) indicates hypothermia, which can be life-threatening. This needs immediate attention to determine the underlying cause and implement rewarming measures. A bicarbonate level of 10 mEq/L indicates severe metabolic acidosis, a critical component of DKA, demanding immediate treatment to restore acid-base balance. A potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L indicates hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in the context of insulin administration, necessitating prompt potassium replacement.",
    "incorrect": "A sodium level of 152 mEq/L is elevated (hypernatremia), but in the context of DKA/HHS, it is often due to dehydration and hyperglycemia pulling water from the cells. While it needs correction, it is not as immediately life-threatening as the other options. A PaO2 of 90 mmHg is within the normal range and does not require immediate intervention. While the BUN and creatinine are elevated, indicating renal impairment, they are not the highest priority in this acute situation. The blood pressure is low, but improving with fluid resuscitation, and is not as immediately life-threatening as the other derangements.",
