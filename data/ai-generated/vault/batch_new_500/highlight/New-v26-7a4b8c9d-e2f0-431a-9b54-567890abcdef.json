A: He has a history of hypertension but is otherwise healthy. B: On admission, the patient was alert and oriented. His last acetaminophen level, taken at 04:00, was 350 mcg/mL. O: Currently, at 07:00, the patient is exhibiting increasing confusion and agitation. He is observed picking at his bedsheets and mumbling incoherently. His vital signs are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and Temp 37.9°C (100.2°F). His abdomen is distended and tender upon palpation. An ammonia level resulted at 06:30. R: The patient is displaying clear signs of hepatic encephalopathy. I am requesting orders to address his elevated ammonia levels, manage his agitation, and assess the need for further neurological evaluation due to his declining mental status. Consider initiating seizure precautions.",

The elevated ammonia directly contributes to hepatic encephalopathy, leading to altered mental status. The elevated blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and Lorazepam administration for agitation all indicate a worsening condition that correlates with escalating symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. The use of Lorazepam to control the agitation caused by the encephalopathy is also relevant.",

Creatinine within normal limits suggests that renal function is currently adequate. Acetylcysteine is used to treat the acetaminophen overdose and does not directly relate to encephalopathy. Normal Saline is for hydration and does not directly indicate encephalopathy.",
