B: Patient has a history of well-controlled gestational hypertension during pregnancy. She received magnesium sulfate during labor for preeclampsia prophylaxis, which was discontinued 2 hours postpartum per protocol. A: At 00:00, patient reports increased vaginal bleeding and feeling lightheaded. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C (99°F). Fundus is boggy and palpable 2 cm above the umbilicus, deviated to the right. Moderate lochia rubra with several large clots. Patient reports a headache and blurred vision. Received 500mL of IV fluids in the last hour. O: Notified the physician immediately about the patient's condition and the potential for postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia. Orders received for repeat lab work, fluid bolus, and close monitoring of vital signs. Methylergonovine administered per order. Considering possible transfer to higher level of care if condition worsens.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate potential complications of postpartum preeclampsia and/or postpartum hemorrhage. A blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg, 6 hours postpartum, is indicative of postpartum preeclampsia and requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as eclampsia or stroke. A boggy fundus that is deviated to the right suggests uterine atony and/or a full bladder, contributing to postpartum hemorrhage. Moderate lochia rubra with several large clots indicates excessive bleeding, a hallmark of postpartum hemorrhage, necessitating immediate management to prevent further blood loss and hypovolemic shock. The 2+ protein in the urine is indicative of preeclampsia, and should be monitored.",
    "incorrect": "While a heart rate of 110 bpm is elevated, it's important to consider the context. In the immediate postpartum period, some degree of tachycardia can be expected due to blood loss and fluid shifts. However, in conjunction with other findings like elevated blood pressure and excessive bleeding, it raises concern. A temperature of 37.2°C (99°F) is within the normal range for the postpartum period and does not necessarily indicate an immediate problem. While lightheadedness is a symptom reported by the patient, it is a subjective feeling, not an objective finding.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Postpartum preeclampsia can occur up to 6 weeks after delivery. Monitor blood pressure closely in the postpartum period, especially in women with a history of gestational hypertension.",
      "Assess the fundus regularly in the postpartum period. A boggy fundus should be massaged until firm. Ensure the bladder is empty to prevent uterine atony.",
