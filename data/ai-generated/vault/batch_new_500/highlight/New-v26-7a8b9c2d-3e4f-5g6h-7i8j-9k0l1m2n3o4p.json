He lives alone in a rural area with limited access to transportation, which delayed seeking immediate care. NIHSS score on admission was 18. IV Alteplase was initiated at 02:30 and completed at 03:30. \nA: On admission, GCS was 14. Pupils equal and reactive. Mild left-sided weakness noted. BP 180/100 mmHg. SpO₂ 96% on room air. \nR: Admitted to the neuro-ICU for post-thrombolytic monitoring. Strict neurological checks, vital signs every 15 minutes. Maintain SBP < 180 mmHg. Head of bed at 30 degrees. Awaiting admission labs and CT scan results.\n\nProgress Note (07:00)\nS: Reporting on Jameson Walker, post-ischemic stroke. Client has shown acute neurological decline over the past hour.\nB: Alteplase infusion was completed at 03:30. Initial post-infusion period was stable.\nA: At 07:00, client is less responsive to verbal stimuli and difficult to arouse. GCS has declined to 11 (E2, V4, M5) from 14 on admission. Neurological assessment reveals anisocoria, with the right pupil at 6 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. New-onset left-sided weakness is present, with motor strength 1/5. Vital signs reflect Cushing's response: BP 200/100 mmHg, HR 54/min, RR 24/min and irregular. Client reports a worsening headache, rating it 8/10. Acetaminophen 650 mg was administered at 06:00 with minimal relief. Neurologist has been notified of the change in condition.\nR: Recommend immediate stat head CT without contrast to rule out hemorrhagic conversion. Prepare for potential administration of mannitol and possible neurosurgical intervention. Continue frequent neuro assessments."
