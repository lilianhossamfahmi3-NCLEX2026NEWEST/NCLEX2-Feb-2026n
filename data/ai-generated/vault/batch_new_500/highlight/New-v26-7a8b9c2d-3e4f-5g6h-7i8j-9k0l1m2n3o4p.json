            "correct": "The highlighted findings directly indicate increased ICP. A decreasing GCS (Level of consciousness decreased; GCS now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5)) indicates worsening neurological function. Unequal pupils (Pupils unequal; right pupil 6mm and sluggishly reactive to light) suggest pressure on the oculomotor nerve. The need for increased oxygen (Requires increased oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO2 >94%) is due to possible respiratory compromise secondary to brainstem compression. Elevated blood pressure (BP elevated to 200/110) is the body's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion (Cushing's Triad). New onset of weakness (New onset of left-sided weakness noted (1/5 motor strength)) indicates increased pressure on motor pathways. These are all critical signs that the patient's condition is deteriorating and requires immediate intervention.",
            "incorrect": "Acetaminophen administration, although relevant to patient care, does not directly support increased ICP. While headache is a symptom of increased ICP, it is a subjective complaint and not an objective finding. Neurologist notification is an appropriate action but not a direct assessment finding. The patient's report of a headache may be related to increased ICP, but it is not as direct and objective as the other findings.",
