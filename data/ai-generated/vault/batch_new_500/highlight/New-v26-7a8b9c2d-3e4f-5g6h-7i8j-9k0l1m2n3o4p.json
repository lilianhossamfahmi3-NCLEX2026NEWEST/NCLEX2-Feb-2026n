B: History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Last dose of IV Alteplase completed at 03:30. A: At 07:00, patient's GCS has decreased from 14 to 11. Pupils are now unequal; right pupil 6mm and sluggishly reactive, left pupil 3mm and reactive to light. Patient is now requiring increased oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO2 >94%. Noted new onset of left-sided weakness. BP trending upward. R: Recommend immediate neurological assessment and CT scan of the head without contrast to evaluate for increased ICP and possible hemorrhagic conversion. Consider administering mannitol per protocol. Notify neurosurgery for emergent consultation if ICP continues to rise.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings (Level of consciousness decreased; GCS now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5), Pupils unequal; right pupil 6mm and sluggishly reactive to light, Requires increased oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO2 >94%, BP elevated to 200/110, New onset of left-sided weakness noted (1/5 motor strength)) directly indicate increased ICP. A decreasing GCS indicates worsening neurological function. Unequal pupils, particularly a dilated and sluggish pupil, suggests pressure on the oculomotor nerve. The need for increased oxygen is due to possible respiratory compromise secondary to brainstem compression. Elevated blood pressure is the body's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion (Cushing's Triad). New onset of weakness indicates increased pressure on motor pathways.",
    "incorrect": "Acetaminophen administration, although relevant to patient care, does not directly support increased ICP. While headache is a symptom of increased ICP, it is a subjective complaint and not an objective finding. Neurologist notification is an appropriate action but not a direct assessment finding. The patient's report of a headache may be related to increased ICP, but it is not as direct and objective as the other findings.",
