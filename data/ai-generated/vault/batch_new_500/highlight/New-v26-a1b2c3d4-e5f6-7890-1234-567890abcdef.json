He was prescribed sertraline but self-discontinued 6 months ago, citing feeling 'better'. His father died by suicide when the client was 22. The client lives alone and reports increasing social isolation. He recently lost his employer-sponsored health insurance, creating a significant barrier to accessing outpatient psychiatric care.\n\nA: On admission, client is tearful, anxious, with a flat affect. He denies an active suicide plan or intent but endorses a passive death wish, stating, 'It would be easier if I just didn't wake up.'\n\nR: Admit to inpatient psychiatric unit. Initiate 1:1 constant observation for suicide precautions. Consult psychiatry for evaluation and medication management. Obtain admission labs.\n\n---\n\nProgress Note (Day 1, 07:00)\n\nS: Client reports sleeping for only 2 hours and feeling 'exhausted'.\n\nB: Admitted 5 hours ago for suicidal ideation and major depressive episode.\n\nA: <opt_01>Client appears agitated and withdrawn.</opt_01> He is pacing intermittently in his room. <opt_02>He has refused breakfast.</opt_02> <opt_03>He states, \"I don't see any point in going on.\"</opt_03> When asked about his family, he noted that <opt_04>his father died by suicide 10 years ago.</opt_04> He verbalized distress about his current life stressors, stating <opt_05>he recently lost his job and is going through a divorce.</opt_05> Medication history review confirms <opt_06>he stopped taking his sertraline 6 months ago.</opt_06> <opt_07>Vital signs are stable.</opt_07> Admission labs reviewed. <opt_08>Toxicology screen was negative.</opt_08>\n\nR: Continue 1:1 observation.
