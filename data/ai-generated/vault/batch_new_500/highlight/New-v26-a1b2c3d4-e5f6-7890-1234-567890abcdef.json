B: Patient has a history of hypertension, CAD, and prior MI. He presented with severe shortness of breath and chest pain. A: At 07:00, his vital signs are: BP 170/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 32, SpO2 88% on 6L NC. He has audible crackles bilaterally, 3+ pitting edema in lower extremities, and JVD is present. He's restless and anxious. Current medications include furosemide 40mg IVP q12h (last dose given at 05:00), morphine 2mg IVP q4h PRN pain, and oxygen. His most recent BNP is 1200 pg/mL. He is producing minimal urine output. R: I'm concerned about his worsening respiratory distress and fluid overload. I recommend increasing the furosemide dose and considering an arterial blood gas to assess for respiratory failure. I also recommend continuous cardiac monitoring.",
