Presented to ED at 03:00 with severe dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Assessment: At 07:00, patient reports continued shortness of breath. He is on oxygen at 4L via nasal cannula. Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 91%, Temp 37.1°C. Noted crackles bilaterally in the lungs and 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities. Urine output has been 30 mL/hr for the last two hours. He is receiving furosemide 40mg IV push every 6 hours. Pt alert and oriented to person, place and time, but anxious. Request: Continue furosemide as ordered. Monitor vital signs and urine output closely. Assess response to oxygen therapy. Please evaluate for potential need for vasopressors.",

    "correct": "The findings indicating ineffective tissue perfusion are: BP 90/60 mmHg (hypotension reduces blood flow to vital organs), HR 110 bpm (tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output but increases myocardial oxygen demand), Urine output 30 mL/hr (decreased renal perfusion), SpO2 91% (indicates hypoxemia despite oxygen therapy), and elevated BUN & Creatinine (indicates kidney injury due to poor perfusion).",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options include temperature of 37.1°C, which is within normal limits and does not directly indicate ineffective tissue perfusion. The respiratory rate of 28, although elevated, is primarily related to the pulmonary congestion from heart failure and while contributing to overall patient distress, does not in itself indicate the primary issue of tissue perfusion. The normal WBC count, potassium and glucose levels do not indicate ineffective tissue perfusion.",
