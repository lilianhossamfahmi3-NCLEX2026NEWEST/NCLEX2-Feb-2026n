    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 72-year-old male, was admitted three days ago with a diagnosis of pneumonia. He has a history of COPD and hypertension, managed with medications. The patient has been receiving IV antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. \nB: Mr. Smith's pneumonia has been treated with Ceftriaxone. He has a history of COPD requiring occasional albuterol nebs, and hypertension managed with oral medications. He is allergic to Penicillin.\nA: At 07:00 today, the patient exhibited increasing confusion and a significant drop in blood pressure to 88/52 mmHg. His heart rate is elevated at 122 bpm, and his respiratory rate is rapid at 28 breaths per minute. His temperature has spiked to 102.5°F (39.2°C). Auscultation reveals new onset crackles in bilateral lower lobes. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr over the past two hours, indicating possible renal compromise. Lab results show a WBC count of 18,000/μL and an elevated lactate level of 4.0 mmol/L. He is currently on 4L of oxygen via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 91%.\nR: I am concerned that Mr. Smith is developing sepsis. I recommend immediate intervention including a fluid bolus to address the hypotension, repeat blood cultures to identify any new sources of infection or antibiotic resistance, and consideration of vasopressor support if the fluid bolus is ineffective in improving his blood pressure. I also recommend continuous monitoring of his vital signs and oxygen saturation, and further assessment of his respiratory status. I will notify the provider immediately of these changes.",

    "correct": "Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) indicates inadequate tissue perfusion and requires immediate intervention with fluids and vasopressors. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism for decreased cardiac output and requires addressing the underlying cause. Tachypnea (RR 28) and decreased SpO2 (91%) suggest respiratory distress and hypoxemia, necessitating oxygen therapy and assessment for further respiratory support. Elevated Lactate (4.0 mmol/L) is a marker of anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoxia, indicating severe sepsis and requiring immediate intervention to improve perfusion. Elevated WBC (18,000/μL) indicates a significant inflammatory response to infection, suggesting sepsis and the need for continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring.",
    "incorrect": "Pending blood cultures, while important for identifying the causative organism, do not require immediate action in the same way as the other findings. The antibiotic order for ceftriaxone is already prescribed and due at 08:00, so it does not require immediate new action. Elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and Creatinine (1.8 mg/dL) indicate renal impairment, but while important, they are not as immediately life-threatening as the other findings. The patient's current temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C) requires intervention, but is less immediately life-threatening than other factors listed.",
