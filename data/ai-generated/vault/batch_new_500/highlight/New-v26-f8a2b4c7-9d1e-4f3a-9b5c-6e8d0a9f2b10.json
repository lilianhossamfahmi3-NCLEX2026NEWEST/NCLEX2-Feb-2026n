The pathophysiology involves widespread vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and microvascular thrombosis, leading to maldistribution of blood flow and cellular hypoxia. The highlighted findings are the classic clinical manifestations of this state: hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg), compensatory tachycardia and tachypnea, fever from the systemic inflammatory response, altered mental status from cerebral hypoperfusion, oliguria from renal hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, and elevated lactate, which is a direct marker of anaerobic metabolism due to cellular oxygen deficit.",

While pneumonia is the source of the infection, it is the cause, not a defining criterion of the resulting shock state. The WBC count, while indicative of infection, is part of the broader sepsis criteria but is less specific to the shock phase than the signs of organ hypoperfusion. The goal is to identify the evidence of systemic collapse, not just the presence of infection.",
