        "correct": "The findings that require immediate notification of the healthcare provider are: SpO2 88% on room air, BP 90/60 mmHg, and Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. The SpO2 of 88% indicates significant hypoxemia, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary complications of pancreatitis. A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg indicates hypotension, suggesting possible hypovolemic shock due to third spacing of fluids and decreased perfusion. The decreased urine output of 20 mL/hr indicates potential renal hypoperfusion or failure secondary to hypovolemia and requires immediate intervention. These findings indicate a rapidly deteriorating condition requiring immediate action to prevent further complications and potential organ damage.",
        "incorrect": "Elevated amylase and lipase levels are expected findings in acute pancreatitis, confirming the diagnosis, but do not necessitate immediate notification unless drastically changing. Abdominal distention and tenderness are concerning but are expected findings; the *change* in condition is more important. Elevated WBC is also expected with inflammation and infection but doesn't require *immediate* notification in this scenario. Increased respiratory rate could be a compensatory mechanism, but the low SpO2 is more concerning. Elevated Hematocrit is likely due to hemoconcentration from dehydration; however, the low BP and SpO2 are greater priorities. These findings, while important, do not represent the same level of immediate threat to the patient's life as the highlighted options.",
