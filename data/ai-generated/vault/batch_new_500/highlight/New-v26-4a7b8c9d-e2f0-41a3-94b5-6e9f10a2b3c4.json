Background: History of chronic alcohol use disorder. Patient lives in a rural area and reports difficulty accessing consistent primary care, leading to infrequent health check-ups. He states he had a similar, milder episode last year but did not seek care. Assessment: Abdomen is soft, tender in the epigastric region with guarding. Bowel sounds hypoactive. Vitals stable on admission. Labs show elevated amylase and lipase. Patient is NPO, receiving IV fluids and analgesia. Recommendation: Admit to the medical-surgical unit for management of acute pancreatitis. Continue IV hydration, pain control, and monitor for complications such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or organ dysfunction. Provide resources for alcohol cessation counseling upon stabilization."
