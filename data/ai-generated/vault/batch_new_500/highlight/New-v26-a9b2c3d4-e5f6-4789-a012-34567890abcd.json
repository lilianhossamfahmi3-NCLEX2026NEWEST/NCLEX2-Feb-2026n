Elevated temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count are key indicators of systemic inflammation. Hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) and lethargy further support the diagnosis, suggesting organ dysfunction from inadequate perfusion. Decreased urine output (mentioned in SBAR) also contributes to this assessment. Elevated lactate (from Labs tab) is another critical indicator.",

Overlooking these signs could lead to delayed treatment and potentially adverse patient outcomes.
