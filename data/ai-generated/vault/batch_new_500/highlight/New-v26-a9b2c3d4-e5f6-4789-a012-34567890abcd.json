Presenting concerns include escalating fever, rapid heart rate, and declining blood pressure, raising strong suspicion for sepsis. 07:00 Temp 38.8°C, HR 110, RR 24, BP 90/60. 11:00 becoming increasingly lethargic, decreased urine output (less than 30mL/hr for the past 4 hours). New onset confusion noted; patient is disoriented to time and place. WBC 15,000. Lactate is elevated at 3.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures ordered, pending results. Currently on IV fluids (Normal Saline at 100mL/hr) and oxygen at 2L NC. 14:00 Vitals trending downward, BP now 85/55. SpO2 92%. Physician notified and expressed concern for septic shock. Orders received for repeat blood cultures and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin). Patient reports chills and body aches. Code status: Full code. Family at bedside, anxious about the patient's condition. Requesting immediate evaluation and intervention. Concerns for possible sepsis are escalating due to the patient's deteriorating condition. 15:15 Vancomycin infusing.",

    "correct": "The correct findings to highlight are: 'Temp 38.8°C', 'HR 110', 'RR 24', 'BP 90/60', 'lethargic', 'WBC 15,000'. These findings, taken together, strongly suggest sepsis. Elevated temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count are all key indicators of systemic inflammation. Hypotension (BP 90/60) and lethargy further support the diagnosis, indicating organ dysfunction due to inadequate perfusion. Decreased urine output (mentioned in SBAR) also contributes to this assessment.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize and highlight these key indicators suggests a lack of understanding of the systemic inflammatory response and the clinical presentation of sepsis. Overlooking these signs could lead to delayed treatment and potentially adverse patient outcomes. While 'chills and body aches' are symptoms, they are less specific to sepsis than the vital sign abnormalities and lab results. 'Family at bedside' is irrelevant to the diagnosis of sepsis.",
