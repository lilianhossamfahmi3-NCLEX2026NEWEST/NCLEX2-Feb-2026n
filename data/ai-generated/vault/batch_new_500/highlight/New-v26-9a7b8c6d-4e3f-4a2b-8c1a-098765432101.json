Background: He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and elevated triglycerides. He was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Assessment: At 07:00, the patient is alert and oriented. His abdomen is distended and tender to palpation; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Vital signs: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F). An indwelling urinary catheter is in place, with 30 mL of dark amber urine output in the past hour. Labs are pending. Recommendation: Assess the patient's fluid status and pain control. Evaluate pending lab results, particularly amylase, lipase, and electrolytes. Consider increasing the IV fluid rate and contacting the provider regarding the hypotension and tachycardia. Assess for signs of worsening pancreatitis or complications.",
