Client reports the pain radiates to his back and is rated 10/10.\n\nB: Client has a significant history of chronic alcohol abuse, consuming approximately a pint of vodka daily. He has had two prior hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis. Client is currently unhoused and has limited social support, which is a barrier to consistent healthcare access.\n\nA: On admission, client was tachycardic and hypotensive. Abdomen was tender in the epigastric region. Labs confirmed markedly elevated amylase and lipase. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed.\n\nR: Admitted to the medical-surgical unit for IV hydration, pain management, and bowel rest. Placed on NPO status. Continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring initiated.\n\nProgress Note (Day 2, 07:00)\n\nS: Client reports worsening abdominal pain, now 9/10. States he feels 'short of breath' and dizzy.\n\nB: Overnight, client required increasing fluid resuscitation and one dose of IV hydromorphone at 04:00. Urine output has been minimal over the past 4 hours.\n\nA: Client is restless and diaphoretic. Vital signs show a BP of 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63), heart rate of 120 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28/min and shallow. Oxygen saturation is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Abdomen is distended, firm, and tender to palpation with guarding. A faint bluish discoloration is noted around the umbilicus. Neurological assessment reveals a positive Chvostek's sign on the left cheek. Serum amylase is 1800 U/L. Client remains NPO with IV fluids running.\n\nR: Provider notified of client's deteriorating status. Recommended STAT repeat labs, including ABGs, and immediate transfer to the ICU for management of suspected hypovolemic shock and impending respiratory failure."
