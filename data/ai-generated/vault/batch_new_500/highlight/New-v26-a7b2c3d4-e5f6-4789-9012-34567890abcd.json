He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His current medications include furosemide 40mg IV BID, lisinopril 10mg PO daily, and metoprolol 25mg PO BID.\nB: His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He experienced a recent myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%.\nA: At 06:00 this morning, Mr. Johnson reported increased shortness of breath, especially when lying flat (orthopnea). He also has a productive cough producing pink-tinged sputum. Upon auscultation, crackles were noted bilaterally in the lower lung lobes. His current SpO2 is 89% while on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. His blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, and his heart rate is 110 beats per minute and regular.\nR: We are requesting an order for a stat chest x-ray and a possible increase in his diuretic dosage. The physician was notified of these findings at 06:15.",

These findings indicate worsening heart failure and pulmonary edema. Orthopnea, pink-tinged sputum, and crackles are classic signs of fluid overload in the lungs.
