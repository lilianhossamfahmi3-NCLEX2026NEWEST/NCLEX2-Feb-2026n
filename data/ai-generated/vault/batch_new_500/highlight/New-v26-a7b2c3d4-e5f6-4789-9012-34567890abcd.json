The failing left ventricle cannot effectively pump blood forward, causing a backup of pressure into the pulmonary circulation. This leads to fluid leaking into the alveoli, causing orthopnea, crackles, pink frothy sputum, and hypoxia. The body's compensatory response includes tachycardia, but as cardiac output falls, hypotension ensues, signaling progression towards cardiogenic shock.",

While the client's history of an NSTEMI and a low ejection fraction (EF) are the underlying causes of the heart failure, they are chronic data points.
