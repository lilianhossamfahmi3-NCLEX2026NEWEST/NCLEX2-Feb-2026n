He's shown increased confusion and lethargy this shift. O: At 06:00, his temperature was 39.5°C, HR 135 bpm, RR 32, BP 88/50 mmHg, SpO2 90% on 2L NC. Urine is cloudy and foul-smelling. A: We suspect sepsis secondary to a possible multi-drug resistant UTI. The patient is hypotensive despite a 1L NS bolus. Labs are pending, and the MD has been notified. At 06:15, a norepinephrine drip was started per protocol. At 06:30, blood cultures were drawn, awaiting results. At 07:00, the patient continues to decline, with minimal urine output. Requesting orders for broad-spectrum antibiotics and further fluid resuscitation. At 07:15, the lactate level resulted as 4.5 mmol/L. At 07:30, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, GCS 8.",

These findings, taken together, strongly suggest septic shock and the need for immediate intervention.",

For example, while the patient's history of COPD and hypertension are important, they do not directly point to the current critical state of septic shock. Similarly, while BUN and Creatinine are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction which often occurs in sepsis, they are not as immediate indicators as the vital signs and lactate level.",
