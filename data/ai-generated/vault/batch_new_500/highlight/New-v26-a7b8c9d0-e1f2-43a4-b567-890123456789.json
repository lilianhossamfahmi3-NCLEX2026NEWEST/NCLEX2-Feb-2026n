A: At 08:00, BP is 88/50 mmHg, HR 135 bpm, Temp 102.8°F (39.3°C), SpO2 89% on 2L NC. New onset confusion and decreased urine output noted over the last 4 hours. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. Labs show elevated WBC and Lactate. B: History of hypertension, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. Currently on vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia. DNR/DNI order in place. Condition is concerning, with rapid deterioration and signs of potential septic shock. Requires close monitoring and further investigation.",

These indicate systemic inflammation, poor perfusion, and organ dysfunction characteristic of septic shock. The patient's history of pneumonia and the identification of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture further support the diagnosis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction.",
        "incorrect": "While elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and decreased SpO2 (89% on 2L NC) are abnormal, they are less specific indicators of septic shock than the other findings. Elevated BUN can be related to dehydration or kidney injury, but does not definitively point to septic shock. Hypoxia can be present in pneumonia without the patient necessarily being in septic shock. Acetaminophen is used for fever management and does not directly contribute to the diagnosis of septic shock itself. The current antibiotic orders, though relevant to the patient's overall care, are not direct indicators of the presence of septic shock.",
