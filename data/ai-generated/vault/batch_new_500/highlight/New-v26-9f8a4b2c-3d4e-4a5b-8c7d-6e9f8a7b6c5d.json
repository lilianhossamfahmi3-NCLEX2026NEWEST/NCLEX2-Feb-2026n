B: Diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at 2 weeks old. History of occasional “tet spells,” usually resolved with knee-chest positioning and oxygen. Mother reports increased frequency of spells this past week. A: At 0930, infant became acutely cyanotic, agitated, and hyperpneic, consistent with a hypercyanotic spell. O2 saturation dropped from 92% to 78%. Heart rate increased from 120 to 180 bpm. Respiratory rate increased from 32 to 60 bpm, with increased work of breathing, including circumoral cyanosis and nasal flaring. Mother at bedside is visibly distressed. Current IV infusing D10W at 15 mL/hr. Last morphine dose was at 0300. Respiratory assessment reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally. R: Requesting immediate orders for hypercyanotic spell management. Consider stat blood gas, morphine, and increased oxygen support. Guidance needed on further interventions and escalation if condition worsens.",
