History of intermittent hypercyanotic 'tet' spells, managed at home with knee-chest positioning. Mother reports spells have increased in frequency and duration over the past week. Patient is accompanied by his mother, who is the primary caregiver.\nA: Infant is awake, alert, and in no acute distress. Mild circumoral cyanosis noted on room air. Heart rate regular with a loud, harsh systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Lungs clear. Abdomen soft. Peripheral pulses 2+. SpO₂ 92% on room air.\nR: Continue cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Maintain IV access for hydration. Educate mother on notifying staff immediately if a spell occurs. Prepare for pre-operative protocols.\n\nProgress Note (Day 1, 09:30)\nS: Infant suddenly became acutely cyanotic, agitated, and hyperpneic while being held by his mother.\nB: This presentation is consistent with a hypercyanotic 'tet' spell. The patient has a history of these events.\nA: Infant is inconsolable with marked circumoral and peripheral cyanosis. Respiratory rate is 60/min with significant nasal flaring and retractions. Heart rate is 180 bpm. SpO₂ has dropped to 78% on room air. The systolic murmur has softened, indicating decreased pulmonary blood flow. Mother is at the bedside and is extremely anxious.\nR: Immediately place the infant in the knee-chest position. Apply supplemental oxygen via blow-by. Notify the pediatric cardiologist and respiratory therapist STAT. Prepare to administer PRN morphine sulfate as ordered to decrease agitation and infundibular spasm. Obtain a STAT arterial blood gas."
