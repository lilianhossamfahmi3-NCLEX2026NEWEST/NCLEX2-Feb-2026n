        "correct": "Elevated WBC count (18,000/mm3) indicates the body is fighting an infection. Elevated Lactate (4.5 mmol/L) suggests tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. Elevated Creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (35 mg/dL) point to acute kidney injury, possibly due to decreased perfusion from sepsis. Low Platelets (140,000/mm3) can be a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a complication of sepsis. Elevated Procalcitonin (8 ng/mL) is a strong indicator of bacterial infection and sepsis. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) is a key sign of septic shock due to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is the body's attempt to compensate for decreased perfusion. Tachypnea (RR 28) is the body's attempt to increase oxygenation and compensate for metabolic acidosis. Fever (38.9°C) is a systemic inflammatory response to infection, mediated by cytokines. The purulent drainage from the IV site indicates a localized infection, which can be a source of sepsis. Altered mental status (lethargy and confusion) suggests decreased cerebral perfusion and is a sign of organ dysfunction. Decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) indicates decreased renal perfusion and function.",
        "incorrect": "While other values in the EHR are important for overall patient assessment, the highlighted findings are the most direct indicators supporting a diagnosis of sepsis. Overlooking key lab values or vital signs can lead to a delay in treatment and worsen the patient's condition. Failing to recognize the significance of each indicator in the context of sepsis can result in an incomplete assessment.",
