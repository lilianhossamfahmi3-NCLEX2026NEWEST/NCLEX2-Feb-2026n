    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 78-year-old male, was admitted 3 days ago for pneumonia. He is currently being treated with IV Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. B: Mr. Smith has a history of COPD and hypertension. I've noticed an increased work of breathing and altered mental status during my shift. O: At 07:00, his temperature was 38.9°C, heart rate 122 bpm, respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 88/52 mmHg, and SpO2 90% on 2L NC. The patient is lethargic and confused. Urine output has decreased significantly to 20 mL/hr. There's also a notable wound site on his right forearm, at the IV insertion point, which is erythematous with purulent drainage. A: I suspect sepsis secondary to pneumonia and a possible IV site infection. I'm requesting orders for blood cultures, lactate level, and a fluid bolus. I will notify the provider STAT if his condition continues to deteriorate or if any concerning changes occur.",

    "correct": "Elevated WBC count (18,000/mm3) indicates the body is fighting an infection. Elevated Lactate (4.5 mmol/L) suggests tissue hypoperfusion. Elevated Creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (35 mg/dL) point to kidney injury, possibly due to decreased perfusion. Low Platelets (140,000/mm3) can be a sign of DIC. Elevated Procalcitonin (8 ng/mL) is a strong indicator of bacterial infection and sepsis. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) is a key sign of septic shock. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is the body's attempt to compensate for decreased perfusion. Tachypnea (RR 28) is the body's attempt to increase oxygenation. Fever (38.9°C) is a systemic inflammatory response to infection.",
    "incorrect": "While the other values presented in the EHR are important for overall patient assessment, they are not the most direct indicators supporting a diagnosis of sepsis. Focusing on the specific criteria for sepsis, such as the presence of infection along with systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction, is crucial. Overlooking key lab values or vital signs can lead to a delay in treatment and worsen the patient's condition.",
