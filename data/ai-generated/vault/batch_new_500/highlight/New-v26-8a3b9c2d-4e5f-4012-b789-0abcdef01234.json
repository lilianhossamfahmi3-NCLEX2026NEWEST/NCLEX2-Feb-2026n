Pathophysiologically, air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, causing the lung to collapse. The increasing pressure shifts the mediastinum, compressing the heart and great vessels. This leads to decreased venous return (preload), causing severe hypotension and obstructive shock. The collapsed lung creates a massive ventilation-perfusion mismatch, resulting in profound hypoxemia. Immediate intervention (needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion) is required to relieve the pressure and prevent cardiovascular collapse.",

Minimal chest tube output is concerning for a blockage, which could be the cause, but it is not a direct sign of the resulting tension physiology.
