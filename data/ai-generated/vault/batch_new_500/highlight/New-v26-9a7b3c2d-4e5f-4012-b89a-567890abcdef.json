Her initial blood glucose was 980 mg/dL. B: Ms. Vance has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She lives alone and reportedly missed several doses of her oral hypoglycemic medications. A: Currently, the patient is receiving IV fluids (0.9% normal saline at 200 mL/hr) and a regular insulin infusion at 5 units/hr. Vital signs are monitored hourly. Urine output is closely tracked via Foley catheter. Neurological checks are performed every two hours. O: At 07:00, the patient's blood glucose is 650 mg/dL. Mental status improved to lethargy only. Her current vitals are BP 120/78 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, RR 20 breaths/min, SpO2 98%. Urine output from 03:00-07:00 is 400 mL. The plan is to continue the insulin infusion and fluid resuscitation until the blood glucose reaches 200 mg/dL, then transition to subcutaneous insulin. Electrolytes are being closely monitored. We are awaiting the morning report from the night shift nurse. We are monitoring for cerebral edema due to the rapid decrease in serum glucose.",

The blood pressure is trending towards normal, the heart rate is decreasing, and the respiratory rate is decreasing, indicating a reduction in the body's compensatory mechanisms to combat the hyperosmolar state. This is indicative of effective fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting 'Glucose 650 mg/dL' is incorrect because while it is lower than the initial glucose of 980 mg/dL, it is still significantly elevated and not within the normal range, indicating continued hyperglycemia. Selecting 'Mental Status Lethargic' is incorrect because the patient's mental status has only improved from 'Lethargic, Confused' to just 'Lethargic'. This demonstrates only slight improvement. Selecting 'Urine Output (03:00-07:00) 400 mL' is incorrect because the urine output of 400 mL over four hours may not be sufficient given the patient's hyperglycemic state. Adequate urine output is essential to eliminate excess glucose. The urine output should be closer to 0.5-1 mL/kg/hour to ensure adequate renal perfusion and glucose excretion.",
