Adult child reports client has been increasingly lethargic and confused over the past 3 days and has not been taking her oral diabetes medications regularly. Client has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. On arrival, client is lethargic, responds to verbal stimuli but is disoriented to time and place. Mucous membranes are dry, skin turgor is poor with tenting. Initial fingerstick glucose was >600 mg/dL, lab value confirmed at 980 mg/dL. Severe dehydration secondary to hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is suspected. Initiated two large-bore IVs and began 0.9% sodium chloride infusion. Regular insulin infusion started per protocol. Admitted to ICU for close monitoring.\n\nProgress Note\n07:00: Client has received 4 hours of IV fluid resuscitation and continuous insulin infusion. She remains lethargic but is now oriented to person and place. GCS improved from 13 to 14. Hemodynamic status has stabilized. Skin turgor shows minimal improvement. Mucous membranes remain dry. Urine output via indwelling catheter is averaging 100 mL/hr. Will continue to monitor neurological status, vital signs, and labs closely to guide therapy and prevent complications such as cerebral edema from rapid correction of hyperglycemia."
