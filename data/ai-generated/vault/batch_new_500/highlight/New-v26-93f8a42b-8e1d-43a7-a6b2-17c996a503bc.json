        "correct": "The highlighted findings support hypovolemic shock. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) indicates reduced circulating volume and decreased cardiac output. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased stroke volume. Tachypnea (RR 28 bpm) is another compensatory mechanism to improve oxygenation. Decreased SpO2 (92% on 2L NC) signifies impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL and Hematocrit of 29% both indicate blood loss. Urine output of 15 mL/hr suggests decreased renal perfusion due to hypovolemia. Diaphoresis is a sympathetic response to hypovolemia. The patient's complaint of dizziness further supports the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock due to reduced cerebral perfusion from decreased blood volume. \n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition of hypovolemic shock is crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. The body's compensatory mechanisms, such as increased heart rate and respiratory rate, are initially effective but can fail if the underlying cause (in this case, blood loss) is not addressed promptly. Monitoring trends in vital signs and urine output is essential to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration in the patient's condition.\n\nquestionTrap: Students might focus only on the vital signs and miss the significant blood loss described in the nurse's notes, or normal labs, which are not supporting shock. To overcome this trap, carefully read the entire scenario, including the SBAR and nurse's notes, to identify all relevant data points. Correlate vital signs with other clinical findings to arrive at the correct diagnosis. For example, a low blood pressure combined with a high heart rate and evidence of blood loss strongly suggests hypovolemic shock.\n\nmnemonic: STOP the Bleeding\nS - Seek source of bleed\nT - Trendelenburg position (modified)\nO - Oxygenate\nP - Pressures (vitals)\nB - Blood products/fluids\nL - Labs\nE - Evaluate\nE - Elevate legs\nD - Drugs (vasopressors if needed)\nI - Intervene\nN - Notify MD\nG - Get help!",
        "incorrect": "Lisinopril is for hypertension management, unrelated to the acute shock presentation. The patient's temperature is within normal limits and does not directly indicate hypovolemic shock. Oxycodone is an analgesic and does not directly cause hypovolemic shock. Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, PT, aPTT, and INR values are within normal limits and do not directly support the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock.",
