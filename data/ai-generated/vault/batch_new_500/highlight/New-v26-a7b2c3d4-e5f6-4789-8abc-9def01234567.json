    "sbar": "S: John Smith is a 45-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury, admitted 3 weeks ago for rehabilitation. He is currently experiencing symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysreflexia.\n\nB: The patient sustained the spinal cord injury in a motor vehicle accident. His rehabilitation has been progressing well until today. He has no known history of autonomic dysreflexia episodes, but this is not uncommon post-spinal cord injury.\n\nA: At 0700, the patient reported a severe headache and feeling flushed. His blood pressure is significantly elevated at 210/110 mmHg, and his heart rate is notably low at 52 bpm. He is also exhibiting diaphoresis above the level of his injury and reports feeling anxious, although he denies any pain.\n\nO: I am concerned about possible autonomic dysreflexia. I will assess the patient for potential causes, such as bladder distention or bowel impaction. I will elevate the head of the bed and monitor his vital signs closely. I will notify the physician immediately with any changes or if the symptoms persist beyond 15 minutes or worsen. I have also checked for any skin irritation or pressure points.",

These findings indicate an exaggerated sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury.",
