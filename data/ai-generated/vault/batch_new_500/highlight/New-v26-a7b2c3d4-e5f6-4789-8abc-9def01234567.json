Background: The patient has a history of COPD and hypertension. The CABG procedure was uncomplicated. Assessment: At 06:00, vital signs were: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min (ventilator settings), SpO2 95% on FiO2 40%, Temp 37.2°C. At 08:00, respiratory status changed. Vitals: BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min (ventilator), SpO2 92% on FiO2 40%, Temp 38.5°C. Suctioning at 07:45 yielded thick, yellow secretions. Labs show WBC 14,000/mm3. Recommendation: Stat chest x-ray and sputum culture to rule out VAP. Consider increasing PEEP to improve oxygenation.",
