            "The 'VAP bundle' is a cornerstone of prevention and includes: head-of-bed elevation (30-45 degrees), daily sedation vacations to assess readiness for extubation, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and regular oral care with chlorhexidine.",
            "Early diagnosis and treatment of VAP are critical as it is associated with increased ventilator days, length of stay, and mortality. A change in sputum characteristics is often one of the earliest and most specific signs."

        "questionTrap": "The trap is focusing on non-specific vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure. While these are elevated, they can be caused by many post-operative stressors. To overcome this, prioritize findings that directly point to a pulmonary infectious process: fever, hypoxemia, purulent sputum, and leukocytosis.",
