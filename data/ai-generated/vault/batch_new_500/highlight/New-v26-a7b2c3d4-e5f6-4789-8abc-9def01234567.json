    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, 68-year-old male, post-op day 3 following a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. Background: History of COPD and hypertension. Procedure was uncomplicated. Assessment: At 06:00, vital signs were stable: BP 130/80, HR 88, RR 16 (ventilator settings), SpO2 95% on FiO2 40%. However, at 08:00, I noted a change in respiratory status. Recommendation: I recommend a stat chest x-ray and sputum culture to rule out VAP. Consider increasing the PEEP to improve oxygenation. Patient also received scheduled morphine at 07:00. The patient's oral care was completed at 07:30 using chlorhexidine. Suctioning was performed at 07:45, yielding thick, yellow secretions. Patient is on continuous enteral feeding at 60 mL/hr. The ventilator settings are: FiO2 0.4, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 500 mL, Rate 14 breaths/min. Last dose of cefazolin was given at 05:00.",
