        "correct": "The elevated respiratory rate (28 breaths/min) indicates increased work of breathing and inadequate ventilation. Diminished breath sounds on the left suggest possible pneumothorax or lung collapse. Low blood pressure (100/60 mmHg) could indicate hypovolemia or sepsis. Elevated ETCO2 (48 mmHg) combined with ABG (PaCO2 55 mmHg, pH 7.30) confirms respiratory acidosis. Low PaO2 of 65 mmHg indicates hypoxemia. Elevated PIP (35 cm H2O) suggests increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance.",
        "incorrect": "Elevated WBC (14,000/uL) suggests infection but doesn't require *immediate* intervention given the acute respiratory distress and existing antibiotic order. Elevated HR (110 bpm) is likely compensatory to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Morphine administration requires monitoring for respiratory depression, but is not the priority.",
