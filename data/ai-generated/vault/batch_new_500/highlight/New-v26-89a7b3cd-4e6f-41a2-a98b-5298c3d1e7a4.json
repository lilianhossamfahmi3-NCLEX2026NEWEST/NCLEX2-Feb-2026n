The pathophysiology involves air entering the pleural space without a means of escape, causing lung collapse and a mediastinal shift. This shift compresses the great vessels (vena cava), obstructing venous return to the heart, which leads to profound hypotension and obstructive shock. The combination of a sudden rise in PIP, unilateral diminished breath sounds, tracheal deviation, and hemodynamic collapse is pathognomonic for this condition.",
