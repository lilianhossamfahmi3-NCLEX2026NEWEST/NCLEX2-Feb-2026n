He had a Foley catheter placed this morning at 08:00 due to urinary retention. His last bowel movement was three days ago. \nA: At 14:00, his blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 55 bpm, and he's diaphoretic above the level of injury. He is also complaining of blurred vision. The Foley catheter is draining clear urine. Assess for potential causes of autonomic dysreflexia and implement appropriate interventions.\nR: I recommend checking for kinks in the Foley catheter, assessing for bowel impaction, and administering PRN antihypertensive medication as ordered. Monitor blood pressure closely.",

    "correct": "The correct findings indicative of autonomic dysreflexia are: Severe headache, Blood pressure 210/110 mmHg, Heart rate 55 bpm, Diaphoresis above the level of injury, and Blurred vision. Autonomic dysreflexia is characterized by a sudden onset of excessively high blood pressure, bradycardia, severe headache, and diaphoresis above the level of the injury. Blurred vision can also occur due to the elevated blood pressure.",
    "incorrect": "Flushed skin above the level of injury, patient feeling anxious, abdomen distended and firm to palpation, patient feeling cold and clammy below level of injury, and clear urine are incorrect. While the patient feeling anxious and abdomen distended are important findings, they are not direct indicators of autonomic dysreflexia but contributing factors. Flushed skin above the level of injury and cold and clammy skin below the injury level is a characteristic, not the highlighted 'skin is flushed' alone. Clear urine is an expected finding with a functioning Foley catheter.",

    "Skin is flushed above the level of injury.": "Flushed skin above the level of injury combined with cold and clammy skin below the injury level is a characteristic of autonomic dysreflexia, but the 'skin is flushed' alone is not specific enough.",
    "Complains of blurred vision.": "Blurred vision can occur due to the elevated blood pressure in autonomic dysreflexia.",
    "Foley catheter patent and draining clear urine.": "Clear urine is an expected finding with a functioning Foley catheter and does not indicate autonomic dysreflexia.",

    "BP: 210/110 mmHg": "Elevated blood pressure is a hallmark sign of autonomic dysreflexia.",
