Patient has an allergy to Penicillin. Lives in a senior apartment complex with limited family support, making follow-up care a potential challenge.\nA: On admission, vitals were stable. He was alert and oriented x4. Physical exam revealed coarse crackles in the right lower lobe. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe pneumonia. IV access established.\nA: Started on IV normal saline at 75 mL/hr and broad-spectrum antibiotics per protocol. Placed on Contact & Droplet precautions due to MRSA history.\nR: Continue current treatment plan. Monitor respiratory status, vital signs, and response to antibiotics closely. Consult social work regarding discharge planning and support systems.\n\nProgress Note (Day 3, 07:00)\nS: Reporting an acute change in the patient's condition.\nB: The patient is a 78-year-old male on day 3 of treatment for pneumonia. His history is significant for MRSA colonization.\nA: At 07:00, the patient is acutely hypotensive with a [blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg]. He is tachycardic with a [heart rate of 135 bpm] and tachypneic with a [respiratory rate of 32]. [Urine output has decreased to 15 mL/hr] over the past hour. His [temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C)]. Neurologically, he is now [alert and oriented to person only]. Skin is cool and clammy. Recent labs show a [WBC count of 22,000/mm³] and a serum [Lactate of 4.5 mmol/L].\nR: Recommend immediate fluid resuscitation, obtaining new blood cultures, and notifying the provider for potential vasopressor support and antibiotic escalation. High concern for septic shock."
