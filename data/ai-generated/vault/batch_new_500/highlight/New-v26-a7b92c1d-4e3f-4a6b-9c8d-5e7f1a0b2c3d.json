Recent labs show elevated WBC and lactate. Patient has a history of MRSA colonization and recent antibiotic use, raising suspicion for a multi-drug resistant organism. A: At 07:00, the patient is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg, tachycardic with a heart rate of 135 bpm, and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 32. Urine output has decreased significantly to 15 mL/hr. Skin is cool and clammy to the touch. The patient is alert and oriented to person only, indicating a change in mental status. At 07:15, new onset confusion is noted. Oxygen saturation is 90% on 6L nasal cannula despite increased respiratory effort. Concern for septic shock is high given the constellation of symptoms. Orders have been received for a fluid bolus and blood cultures to evaluate for infection and guide treatment. We are closely monitoring his response to interventions. R: Please address hypotension and decreased urine output immediately. Consider repeating blood cultures and adjusting antibiotic regimen based on culture results.",

While elevated WBC (22,000/mm3) and lactate (4.5 mmol/L) are significant findings confirming infection and tissue hypoxia, the immediate perfusion issues (hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria) are more critical for identifying and managing septic shock. Confusion can be a sign of decreased cerebral perfusion, but it is a later manifestation compared to the more immediate physiological indicators of shock; addressing the perfusion deficits is paramount.",
