It is caused by a sudden spasm of the right ventricular outflow tract, which drastically reduces pulmonary blood flow and causes a massive right-to-left shunt of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation. This leads to profound hypoxemia, acidosis, and severe respiratory distress. The highlighted findings are the classic signs of this acute decompensation and require immediate, specific interventions to prevent cardiac arrest and neurological injury.",
