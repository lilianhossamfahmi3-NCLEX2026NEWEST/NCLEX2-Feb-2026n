B: Liam was diagnosed with TOF at birth and has been managed medically with propranolol. He has had increasing cyanotic episodes in the past week. At 08:00, his SpO2 was 78% on room air. A: At 09:00, Liam is restless and irritable. His respiratory rate is 60 breaths/min with intercostal retractions. Heart rate is 180 bpm. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. The latest SpO2 is 72% on room air. He has a new onset murmur. Assessment reveals circumoral cyanosis and clubbing of the fingers. R: I am concerned about a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell). I recommend immediate notification of the cardiology team and preparation for possible interventions, including oxygen administration, morphine administration, and knee-chest positioning. Please advise on further management. Propranolol was held at 06:00 due to bradycardia (HR 90).",

An SpO2 of 72% on room air is critically low and indicates severe hypoxemia, necessitating immediate oxygen administration and further assessment. A pH of 7.30 indicates acidosis, likely respiratory in origin due to hypoventilation from the hypercyanotic spell, requiring immediate intervention to improve ventilation and correct the acid-base imbalance.",
        "incorrect": "A heart rate of 180 bpm is elevated (tachycardia) but is expected during a Tet spell and is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output; the priority is to address the hypoxemia and acidosis first. Hemoglobin of 18.5 g/dL and Hematocrit of 55% are elevated (polycythemia) due to chronic hypoxemia associated with Tetralogy of Fallot; these are chronic findings and not the immediate priority. A PaCO2 of 55 mmHg indicates hypercapnia, which is consistent with hypoventilation during a Tet spell but less urgent than the pH and SpO2 values.",
