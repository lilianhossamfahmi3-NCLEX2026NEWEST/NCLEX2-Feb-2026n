        "correct": "The correct findings indicating hyperkalemia are: 'ECG reveals peaked T waves', 'Potassium level 6.8 mEq/L', and 'reports tingling in extremities'. Peaked T waves on ECG are a classic sign of hyperkalemia due to the effect of elevated potassium on myocardial repolarization. A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L is significantly elevated, confirming hyperkalemia. Tingling in extremities (paresthesia) is another symptom of hyperkalemia resulting from altered nerve excitability caused by the increased extracellular potassium concentration.",
        "incorrect": "The following findings do NOT directly indicate hyperkalemia. 'Generalized weakness and palpitations' are non-specific symptoms and could be caused by various conditions. While weakness can occur in hyperkalemia, it is not specific. Palpitations may be related to underlying cardiac issues. 'Missed dialysis appointment' is a risk factor for hyperkalemia in CKD patients but does not directly confirm it. 'Bradycardia' can be related to hyperkalemia, but other factors such as medications (metoprolol) may cause it. 'BP 100/60' indicates hypotension, which may be related to the patient's overall condition but is not specific to hyperkalemia. 'Patient feels lethargic' is a non-specific symptom.",
