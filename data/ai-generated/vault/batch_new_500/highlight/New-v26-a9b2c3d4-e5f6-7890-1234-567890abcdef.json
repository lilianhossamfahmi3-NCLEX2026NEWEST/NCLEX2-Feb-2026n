He had a generally stable post-operative course overnight. R: The night was reported as uneventful with stable vital signs and adequate perfusion until the current episode. O: 0715. The infant suddenly became agitated and is crying inconsolably. 0720: Increased cyanosis is noted around the mouth and nailbeds. His baseline SpO2 yesterday ranged from 80-85%. Currently, his SpO2 is 68%. HR is 180 bpm, and RR is 60 bpm and shallow. 0725: Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. 0730: Attempts to calm the infant have been unsuccessful. Oxygen was administered via nasal cannula at 2L. A: Possible hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell) is suspected given the sudden onset of agitation, cyanosis, and desaturation. B: I require orders for further intervention to manage the desaturation and stabilize the patient's condition. I am preparing to place the infant in the knee-chest position. Please advise on appropriate pharmacological interventions and further diagnostic evaluations.",

    "correct": "The correct findings to highlight are: 'increased cyanosis around mouth and nailbeds', 'SpO2 is 68%', 'HR 180 bpm', 'RR 60 bpm', and 'crying inconsolably'. These findings are indicative of a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell) in an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot. The sudden increase in cyanosis and desaturation, coupled with increased heart and respiratory rates, and inconsolable crying, all point towards a critical decrease in pulmonary blood flow and increased right-to-left shunting.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect findings to highlight would include the baseline vital signs, the normal lab values, and the medications prescribed PRN. These do not directly reflect the acute physiological changes associated with a hypercyanotic spell. Focusing on baseline data or unrelated parameters can distract from the immediate life-threatening situation.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, decreasing right-to-left shunting in TOF.",

      "trap": "Students may focus on the baseline vital signs or lab values, rather than the acute changes that signal the hypercyanotic spell. They might also overlook the behavioral changes, such as inconsolable crying, as an indicator of distress and hypoxia.",

Encourage careful comparison of current vital signs to baseline and understanding the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot and its associated complications."
