            "Hypercyanotic 'Tet spells' are often triggered by stressors that decrease systemic vascular resistance (SVR) or increase pulmonary vascular resistance, such as crying, feeding, defecation, or waking from sleep.",
            "The primary intervention for a Tet spell is the knee-chest position. This maneuver increases SVR, which decreases the right-to-left shunt across the VSD and forces more blood through the stenotic pulmonary valve into the lungs.",
            "Pharmacological interventions for a Tet spell include morphine to reduce agitation and decrease respiratory drive, IV fluids to improve preload, and potentially beta-blockers (like propranolol) to relax the infundibular spasm."

        "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing chronic, compensatory findings (polycythemia, clubbing) with acute, life-threatening signs of a hypercyanotic spell. Test-takers must differentiate between the patient's baseline abnormalities and the indicators of an acute crisis.",
