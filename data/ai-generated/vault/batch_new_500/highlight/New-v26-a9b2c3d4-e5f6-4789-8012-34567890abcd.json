A heart rate of 180 bpm is significantly elevated for a 6-month-old infant, indicating tachycardia and potential distress. The respiratory rate of 64 is also elevated (tachypnea), suggesting respiratory distress and potential compensation for hypoxemia. These findings are critical in a patient with Tetralogy of Fallot and require immediate action to prevent further deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "The temperature of 37.8°C (100°F) is slightly elevated but not the most critical finding requiring immediate intervention. While it warrants monitoring, the hypoxemia, tachycardia, and tachypnea pose a more immediate threat. The hemoglobin of 18 g/dL and hematocrit of 54% are elevated, consistent with polycythemia seen in chronic hypoxemia with congenital heart defects, but are not the priority for immediate intervention. The elevated H&H are expected and the body's response to low oxygen.",
