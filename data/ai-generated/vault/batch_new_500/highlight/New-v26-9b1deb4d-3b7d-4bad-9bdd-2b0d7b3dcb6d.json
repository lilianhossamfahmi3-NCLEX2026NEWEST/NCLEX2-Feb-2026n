The elevated blood pressure and heart rate are compensatory mechanisms in response to the increased fluid volume and the heart's attempt to maintain cardiac output. Crackles indicate the presence of fluid in the lungs due to pulmonary edema. Edema and JVD are signs of increased venous pressure, a hallmark of fluid overload.",

While BUN and creatinine levels are slightly elevated, they are not definitive indicators of fluid overload without further context. Albumin is slightly decreased, which can be related to fluid shifts but is not a primary indicator on its own.",
