This is triggered by a spasm of the right ventricular outflow tract. The correct findings—severe cyanosis, critical hypoxemia (SpO₂ 68%), profound respiratory distress (RR 60 with retractions), and acidosis (pH 7.30)—are direct indicators of this severe physiological decompensation and require immediate intervention to prevent neurological injury or death.",

Tachycardia is an expected response to hypoxemia. The systolic murmur is a baseline finding in TOF.
