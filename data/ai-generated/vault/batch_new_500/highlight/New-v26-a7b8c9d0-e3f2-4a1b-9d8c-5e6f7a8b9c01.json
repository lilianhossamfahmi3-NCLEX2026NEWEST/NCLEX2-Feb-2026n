Background: Admitted at 07:00 today for elective surgical repair. At 13:30, he became acutely cyanotic and agitated. Assessment: At 13:45, SpO2 is 68%, heart rate 180 bpm, respiratory rate 60 breaths/min, with grunting and retractions. He is diaphoretic. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. Labs show pH 7.30 and PaO2 50 mmHg. Current medications include morphine sulfate 0.5mg IV PRN (last dose 10:00) and oxygen 2L/min via nasal cannula. Mother is at bedside, visibly distressed. Recommendation: Immediately assess and manage the hypercyanotic spell. Increase oxygen, administer morphine, and position in knee-chest. Prepare for possible intubation. Requesting immediate orders at 13:50.",

Hemoglobin of 18.5 g/dL and Hematocrit of 55% are elevated, indicating polycythemia, a common finding in children with cyanotic heart defects, but these values are not an immediate threat. PaCO2 of 55 mmHg is elevated, indicating hypercapnia, but addressing oxygenation and ventilation is the priority. Although the infant is diaphoretic and retracting, these are symptoms of respiratory distress, it is the measurable vitals and lab values that will provide the most immediate data.",
