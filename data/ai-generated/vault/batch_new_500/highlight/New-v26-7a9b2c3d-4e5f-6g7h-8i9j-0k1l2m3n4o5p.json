These signs indicate inadequate circulating volume, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and oxygenation. The body attempts to compensate by increasing heart rate and respiratory rate to maintain oxygen delivery.",
        "incorrect": "Normal lab values and interventions not directly related to hypovolemia should not be selected. For instance, electrolyte levels within normal limits (Sodium 140 mEq/L, Potassium 4.1 mEq/L, Chloride 100 mEq/L) do not directly contribute to diagnosing hypovolemic shock. Pain level (2/10) at the surgical site is important for patient comfort but not a primary indicator of hypovolemic shock. Medication administration times are relevant for context but not diagnostic of the shock state itself.",
