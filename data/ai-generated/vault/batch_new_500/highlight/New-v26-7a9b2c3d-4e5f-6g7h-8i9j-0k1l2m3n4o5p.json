        "correct": "The selected findings collectively indicate a state of decompensated hypovolemic shock. The pathophysiology involves decreased intravascular volume, leading to reduced preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output. This results in hypotension (BP 88/52) and inadequate tissue perfusion. The body's compensatory mechanisms include tachycardia (HR 122) and tachypnea (RR 28) to improve cardiac output and oxygenation. Peripheral vasoconstriction shunts blood to vital organs, causing cool, clammy skin and delayed capillary refill. Reduced renal perfusion leads to oliguria (30 mL in 4 hours), and cerebral hypoperfusion manifests as lethargy. Hypoxia (SpO₂ 92%) is a late and ominous sign.",
        "incorrect": "The distractors represent information that, while important, does not directly support the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock in this context. A dry surgical dressing is a key distractor because it can create a false sense of security; it rules out external bleeding at the site but not a significant internal hemorrhage. A low pain score (2/10) makes it less likely that the patient's tachycardia is primarily driven by pain, further strengthening the case for a hemodynamic cause.",
