B: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, and insulin. A: At 06:00, the patient reported increased shortness of breath. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 28 and labored breathing. Coarse crackles are auscultated bilaterally. He has 2+ lower extremity edema and a productive cough with pink, frothy sputum. His BP is 170/100 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm with an S3 gallop. Urine output has been 30 mL/hr for the past two hours, and his weight has increased by 4 kg since admission. P: Orders include furosemide 40 mg IV push STAT, oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%, strict I&O monitoring, and notification to the provider for SBP > 180 or SpO2 < 90% despite oxygen. Continue cardiac monitoring and frequent vital sign assessment. Elevate the head of the bed.",

These signs are classic manifestations of ADHF. The elevated BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) of 850 pg/mL also supports the diagnosis of heart failure, as BNP is released in response to ventricular stretching.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting findings unrelated to fluid overload would be incorrect. For example, while elevated heart rate and blood pressure may accompany ADHF, they are not direct indicators of fluid accumulation. Similarly, while decreased sodium (hyponatremia) can sometimes occur in heart failure, it is not a primary indicator of fluid overload itself, but rather a consequence of the body's attempt to regulate fluid balance. Elevated creatinine suggests kidney dysfunction, possibly related to the heart failure, but not a direct marker of fluid overload. Troponin I elevation indicates myocardial damage, related to the recent STEMI, but not directly to fluid overload.",
