R: Post-thyroidectomy, at 06:00, the patient became increasingly restless and agitated. Her vital signs were significantly elevated: BP 180/100, HR 140, Temp 104.2°F (40.1°C). B: Initially, the patient was started on IV fluids and acetaminophen to manage the fever. A: At 06:15, the patient's condition appeared to be worsening, prompting notification of the MD. New orders were received, requiring immediate assessment and implementation. By 06:30, the patient was increasingly agitated, diaphoretic, and complaining of palpitations. Oxygen saturation was 92% on 2L nasal cannula. STAT labs and ECG were ordered and drawn at 06:45, and continuous cardiac monitoring was initiated. At 07:00, while awaiting lab results, prescribed propranolol was administered. However, the patient's anxiety level remains high, and her vital signs continue to be elevated.",

The normal Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN, Creatinine, and Glucose values do not directly support the diagnosis of thyroid storm, as these are not typically affected in this condition.",
