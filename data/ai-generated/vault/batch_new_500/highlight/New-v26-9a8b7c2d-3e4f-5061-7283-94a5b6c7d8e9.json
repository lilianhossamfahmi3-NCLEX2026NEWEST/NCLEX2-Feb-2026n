    "sbar": "S: Mr. Smith is a 58-year-old male admitted for acute pancreatitis five days ago. He developed worsening abdominal distension and pain overnight. BP has dropped since 04:00. B: History of heavy alcohol use. Previously managed with IV fluids and pain medication. A: At 06:00, the patient is reporting severe abdominal pain rated 9/10. Abdomen is rigid and distended. Current vital signs: BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.8°C. I&O shows decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) over the last 4 hours. Pancreatic enzymes remain elevated. R: I am concerned about possible pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst rupture. I recommend immediate assessment by the attending physician, repeat abdominal imaging, and consideration for transfer to a higher level of care. I also recommend increasing the oxygen to 4L via nasal cannula and starting a fluid bolus of 500 mL normal saline.",

    "correct": "Hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg) indicates potential shock, possibly due to fluid shifts, hemorrhage, or sepsis related to pancreatic necrosis. Tachycardia (HR 122 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism for hypotension and decreased oxygen delivery. Tachypnea (RR 28) is a compensatory mechanism for hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Fever (Temp 38.8°C) and elevated WBC (18,000/mm3) suggest infection or inflammation. Hypocalcemia (Calcium 7.0 mg/dL) can occur due to saponification (binding of calcium with fatty acids) in the pancreas, leading to tetany and cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated amylase and lipase are expected findings in acute pancreatitis but do not require immediate intervention unless the patient is symptomatic (e.g., severe abdominal pain, signs of shock). Elevated glucose could be related to stress response or pancreatic damage to the islet cells. While it requires monitoring, it is not the priority. While decreased Hgb and Hct suggest bleeding, the values provided (Hgb 11.0 g/dL, Hct 33%) are not critically low and don't require *immediate* intervention relative to the other choices, especially given the patient's acute presentation of shock. Elevated BUN and creatinine suggest renal impairment due to hypovolemia and decreased perfusion to the kidneys. While concerning, hypotension is the priority.",
