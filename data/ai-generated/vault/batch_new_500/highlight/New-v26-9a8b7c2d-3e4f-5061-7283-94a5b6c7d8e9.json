The client reports progressively worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past 3 days.\n\n**Background:** The client has a known history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a STEMI 2 years prior. He reports difficulty adhering to a low-sodium diet due to financial constraints and limited access to fresh groceries. He lives alone and has decreased mobility.\n\n**Assessment:** Client is alert, anxious, and in respiratory distress. Vital signs show a [heart rate 110/min and regular] with a [blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg]. [SpO2 is 88% on room air]. Respiratory assessment reveals labored breathing at 28/min with [coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally] in the lower lobes. A [productive cough with pink, frothy sputum] is noted. Cardiovascular exam reveals a distinct [S3 heart sound auscultated] at the apex. There is [3+ pitting edema in lower extremities], extending to the mid-calf. The client's [weight gain of 4 kg since admission] from the ED weigh-in is significant.\n\n**Recommendation:** Continue continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. Administer STAT diuretics as ordered. Maintain head of bed elevated. Strict intake and output monitoring. Notify provider of any worsening respiratory distress.\n\n### Progress Note\n**10:00 Progress Note**\nFurosemide 40 mg IV administered at 08:30. Client diuresed 500 mL clear yellow urine. Respiratory rate decreased to 22/min, still with fine crackles in bases. SpO2 improved to 94% on 2L NC. Client reports feeling 'a little less breathless.' BP 158/92 mmHg. Will continue to monitor response."
