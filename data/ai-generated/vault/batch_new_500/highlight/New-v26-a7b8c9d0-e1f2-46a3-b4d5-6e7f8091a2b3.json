Current vitals at 12:00: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10 and irregular, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 37.8°C. The patient is receiving IV fluids at 75 mL/hr and scheduled for mannitol 25g IV STAT. Neuro checks are ordered every hour. The patient is now exhibiting decreased level of consciousness and unequal pupils. Notify MD stat if GCS < 8 or other changes in neuro status. Recent lab results pending. Assess neuro status and administer medications as ordered.",

Bradycardia (HR 55 bpm) is a classic sign of increased ICP. Irregular respirations (RR 10 and irregular) indicate pressure on the brainstem. Decreased level of consciousness (GCS 10) signifies worsening neurological function. Unequal pupils (Right 4mm, Left 2mm and sluggishly reactive to light) indicate pressure on the oculomotor nerve.",
