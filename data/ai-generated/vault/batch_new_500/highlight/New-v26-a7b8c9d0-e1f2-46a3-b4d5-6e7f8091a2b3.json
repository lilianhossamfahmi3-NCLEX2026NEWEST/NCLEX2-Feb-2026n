Assessment: At 10:00, GCS was 14 (E4, V4, M6). At 12:00: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 10 and irregular, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 37.8°C. Receiving IV fluids at 75 mL/hr; Mannitol 25g IV STAT given at 12:05. Hourly neuro checks ordered. Patient now exhibits decreased level of consciousness and unequal pupils.

Bradycardia (HR 55 bpm) is a component of Cushing's triad, a classic sign of increased ICP. Irregular respirations (RR 10 and irregular) indicate pressure on the brainstem affecting respiratory control. Decreased level of consciousness (GCS 10) signifies worsening neurological function due to increased pressure on brain tissue. Unequal pupils (Right 4mm, Left 2mm and sluggishly reactive to light) indicate pressure on the oculomotor nerve (CN III), often due to herniation.",
        "incorrect": "Normal lab values (Na, K, Cl, Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, PT, INR, PTT, WBC) do not directly indicate increased ICP. The patient's allergies are not relevant to the acute presentation of increased ICP. Scheduled Medications (IV Fluids) and PRN medications (Acetaminophen, Labetalol) do not directly indicate increased ICP, but are used to manage symptoms and prevent further complications. These interventions are important but do not directly reflect the presence of increased ICP.",
