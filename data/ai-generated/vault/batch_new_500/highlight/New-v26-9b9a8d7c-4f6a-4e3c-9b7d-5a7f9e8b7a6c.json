The elevated Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) of 35 cm H2O signals increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance, potentially due to bronchospasm, secretions, or worsening pulmonary edema, increasing the risk of barotrauma. The client's spontaneous respiratory rate of 28/min, significantly higher than the ventilator's set rate of 14/min, demonstrates severe respiratory distress and ventilator dyssynchrony. These four findings together paint a critical picture of impending respiratory failure that requires immediate intervention.",

Coarse crackles are an expected finding with pulmonary edema but are less specific for acute decompensation than the objective data from ABGs and ventilator pressures.
