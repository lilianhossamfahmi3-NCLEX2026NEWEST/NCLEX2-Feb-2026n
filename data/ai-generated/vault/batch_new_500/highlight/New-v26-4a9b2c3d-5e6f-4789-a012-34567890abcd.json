A heart rate of 110 bpm indicates tachycardia, potentially due to hypovolemia or heart failure exacerbation, requiring prompt evaluation. The respiratory rate of 28 is elevated, indicating tachypnea, suggesting respiratory distress possibly related to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. A potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L indicates hypokalemia, a dangerous side effect of furosemide, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Prompt intervention is needed to prevent life-threatening complications.",

A sodium level of 130 mEq/L indicates hyponatremia, but is not immediately life-threatening unless neurological symptoms are present. Elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.8 mg/dL) suggest renal impairment, but the change is not acute. A digoxin level of 1.8 ng/mL is within the therapeutic range. A magnesium level of 1.6 mg/dL is slightly below normal, but less critical than K+ and BP. Metoprolol was administered as scheduled.",
