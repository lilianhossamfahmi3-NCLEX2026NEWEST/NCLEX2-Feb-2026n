These findings suggest the client is not tolerating the aggressive diuresis and vasodilatory effects of their medications, leading to poor perfusion, respiratory distress, and a risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias. These are priority findings requiring immediate provider notification for intervention.",

Edema is an expected finding in a heart failure exacerbation. The urine output, while modest (37.5 mL/hr), is still within the minimally acceptable range (>30 mL/hr) and indicates the diuretic is working to some degree. The priority is to address the critical ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and electrolyte imbalances first.",
