A: At 07:00, his vital signs are: HR 112, BP 168/94, RR 28, SpO2 90% on 2L NC, Temp 37.1°C. He has **crackles bilaterally**, a **productive cough with pink-tinged sputum**, and **+3 pitting edema in his lower extremities**. He is **anxious and restless**. His urine output has been minimal since admission. Current medications include furosemide 40mg IV push ordered q12h, first dose given at 04:00. He is on continuous cardiac monitoring. EKG shows sinus tachycardia, no acute ST changes. P: I am concerned about his worsening respiratory status and fluid overload. I recommend increasing the furosemide dose, obtaining a chest x-ray, and considering BiPAP if his oxygen saturation does not improve with increased oxygen delivery.",

    "correct": "Crackles bilaterally, productive cough with pink-tinged sputum, +3 pitting edema in his lower extremities, and anxious and restless are all indicative of fluid volume overload in ADHF. Crackles are caused by fluid in the alveoli. Pink-tinged sputum suggests pulmonary edema. Pitting edema is a classic sign of excess fluid in the interstitial space. Anxiety and restlessness can be early signs of hypoxia related to pulmonary congestion.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated blood pressure (168/94), while concerning, is not the most direct indicator of fluid volume overload in this context. While it contributes to the overall clinical picture, the other findings more specifically point to the acute problem of fluid accumulation. Sinus tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output, but is not a direct indicator of fluid overload.",
