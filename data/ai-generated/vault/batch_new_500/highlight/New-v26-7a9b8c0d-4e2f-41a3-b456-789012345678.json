    "sbar": "S: Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old male admitted three days ago for pneumonia. He now presents with increased work of breathing, including accessory muscle use and nasal flaring, indicating respiratory distress. B: The patient has a history of COPD and is a current smoker with a significant pack-year history. He was initially treated with antibiotics for pneumonia, showing some initial improvement, but his respiratory status has deteriorated rapidly over the past 12 hours. O: Current vital signs at 07:00 show SpO2 of 88% on 6L nasal cannula, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally throughout the lung fields. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was drawn, revealing pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3 24 mEq/L. A recent chest X-ray (CXR) shows bilateral infiltrates. A: The patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), superimposed on his existing pneumonia and COPD. The refractory hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and bilateral infiltrates are concerning. P: I am requesting immediate orders for intubation and mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function. I also recommend increasing the FiO2 if possible prior to intubation. Please notify the attending physician immediately to discuss the patient's critical condition and further management strategies. We need to rule out other potential causes, but ARDS is the primary concern given the clinical picture.",

    "correct": "The patient's PaO2 of 55 mmHg on 6L of nasal cannula indicates refractory hypoxemia, a hallmark of ARDS, where oxygen therapy alone is insufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. The PaCO2 of 55 mmHg indicates hypercapnic respiratory failure. The bilateral diffuse infiltrates on the CXR are consistent with pulmonary edema and alveolar damage seen in ARDS. The increased respiratory rate of 32 indicates the body's attempt to compensate for hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The ABG pH of 7.30 indicates respiratory acidosis due to CO2 retention.",
    "incorrect": "While elevated WBC (15,000/uL) suggests infection, it's not specific to ARDS, though infection can be a cause. Ceftriaxone is treatment for the underlying infection, not ARDS itself. Furosemide addresses fluid overload; while possibly present, it isn't a primary ARDS diagnostic criterion. The increased HR of 120 is a non-specific indicator of distress and compensation for hypoxemia and hypercapnia but is not specific enough to ARDS.",
