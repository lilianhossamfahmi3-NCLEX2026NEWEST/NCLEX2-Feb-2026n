The patient presented with increasing symptoms over the past 24 hours. A: At 07:00, the patient became increasingly agitated and diaphoretic. Vital signs at that time: Temp 104.2°F (40.1°C), HR 180 bpm, BP 180/100 mmHg, RR 32 and shallow, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. The patient reports palpitations and feels like she is 'going to explode.' Mental status: anxious and confused. Notified the attending physician at 07:15. Noted significant lab abnormalities. R: Stat labs were drawn and sent to the lab. Continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status every 15 minutes. Prepare for potential interventions to manage hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension. Obtain a cooling blanket. Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%. Cardiology consult ordered. Repeat EKG. Ensure IV access is patent. Monitor I/O. Administer scheduled medications as prescribed.",

These findings are consistent with the pathophysiology of thyroid storm, which involves excessive thyroid hormone release leading to a hypermetabolic state. The suppressed TSH with elevated Free T3 and Free T4 confirm hyperthyroidism. The elevated temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure reflect the body's response to the excess thyroid hormones.",
        "incorrect": "Normal laboratory values and vital signs do not support a diagnosis of thyroid storm. Focusing on the patient's presenting symptoms and comparing them to reference ranges is crucial. Identifying deviations from normal values that are consistent with the pathophysiology of thyroid storm is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. For example, a normal blood glucose level does not point to thyroid storm. A normal WBC count does not rule out thyroid storm but is not a primary indicator.",
