These clinical signs are directly caused by the profound thyrotoxicosis, which is confirmed by the laboratory results: a suppressed TSH (<0.01) indicating the pituitary is trying to stop production, and massively elevated Free T3 and T4 (7.5 ng/dL and 25.0 pg/mL), the active hormones causing the systemic effects.",
