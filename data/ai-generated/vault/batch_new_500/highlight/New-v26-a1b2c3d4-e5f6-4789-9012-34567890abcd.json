B: He has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous MI. He takes lisinopril, metoprolol, and aspirin at home. A: At 07:00, his vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 88% on room air. He has audible crackles bilaterally and 3+ pitting edema in his lower extremities. He is restless and anxious. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. The morning labs are pending. He is currently on 2L NC oxygen. R: I am concerned about his hypotension, hypoxia, and low urine output. I recommend increasing his oxygen support, obtaining an ABG, and notifying the provider for possible intervention (e.g., IV diuretics, vasopressors). Please assess the patient immediately.",

    "correct": "The patient's BP of 90/50 mmHg indicates hypotension, requiring immediate intervention to improve perfusion. An SpO2 of 88% on room air signifies hypoxia, necessitating increased oxygen support. A respiratory rate of 28 is indicative of tachypnea, likely due to pulmonary edema. Urine output of 20 mL/hr demonstrates decreased renal perfusion and potential kidney injury. Potassium of 5.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "A temperature of 37.2°C (oral) is within normal limits and does not require immediate intervention. Sodium of 132 mEq/L indicates hyponatremia, however is not an immediate threat. While elevated, BNP of 1500 pg/mL is expected in heart failure and does not require immediate action, but rather monitoring of the response to treatment. Troponin of 0.04 ng/mL is slightly elevated but not indicative of an acute MI in this context of ADHF. The focus should be on addressing the acute decompensation.",
