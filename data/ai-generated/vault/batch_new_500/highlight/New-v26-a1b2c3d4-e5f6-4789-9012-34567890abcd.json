    "sbar": "15:00: S: John Smith, 78-year-old male, admitted 3 days ago for pneumonia. He is now reporting a significant increase in shortness of breath and generalized weakness this morning, indicating a possible decline in his condition. 08:00: Vital signs reveal Temp 38.9°C, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, and BP 90/50 mmHg. O: The patient presents with a productive cough yielding yellow sputum, which is consistent with his pneumonia diagnosis. He appears confused and is noticeably diaphoretic. A Foley catheter is in place. He is currently receiving IV fluids of 0.9% NS at 100 mL/hr. A: I am concerned about possible sepsis secondary to his pneumonia, particularly given his worsening respiratory status and altered mental state. There is a high suspicion for developing septic shock. R: I am requesting an immediate assessment by the physician and orders for blood cultures to confirm bacteremia, as well as a potential escalation of antibiotic therapy. We need to evaluate for septic shock, initiate appropriate interventions promptly, and closely monitor the patient's deteriorating condition to prevent further complications. New onset altered mental status noted at 15:05.",

    "correct": "The following findings support the diagnosis of septic shock: Temperature of 39.1°C indicates fever, a common sign of infection. Heart rate of 120 bpm signifies tachycardia, often a compensatory mechanism in sepsis. Respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min indicates tachypnea, reflecting the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis. Blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg signifies hypotension, a hallmark of septic shock due to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Altered mental status (confusion) suggests decreased cerebral perfusion, a consequence of hypotension and systemic inflammation in sepsis. Lactate of 4.5 mmol/L reflects anaerobic metabolism due to poor tissue perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "While pneumonia and elevated creatinine are concerning, they do not directly indicate septic shock. Pneumonia is the underlying infection, and elevated creatinine suggests kidney injury, which can occur in sepsis but isn't a primary diagnostic criterion. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic used to treat the pneumonia, and while relevant to the patient's overall care, it doesn't directly indicate septic shock. An allergy to Penicillin is important to note, but does not directly contribute to the diagnosis of Septic Shock.",
