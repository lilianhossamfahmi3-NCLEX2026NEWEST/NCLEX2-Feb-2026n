Admitted with altered mental status, jaundice, and ascites. O: 07:00 report: Patient increasingly lethargic. Current vitals: BP 90/50, HR 110, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 101.5°F (38.6°C). Abdomen distended. Noted new onset of asterixis. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. A: Worsening liver failure with possible hepatic encephalopathy and early signs of sepsis. Risk for bleeding and further neurological decline. I am concerned about the hypotension, fever, and declining mental status. R: Requesting immediate evaluation by the physician. Consider increasing oxygen support, blood cultures, and initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics per protocol. STAT ammonia and lactate levels ordered.",

    "correct": "The patient's BP of 90/50 mmHg indicates hypotension, which can lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs. The HR of 110 bpm indicates tachycardia, likely a compensatory mechanism for the hypotension or an indication of sepsis. A RR of 28 breaths/min suggests respiratory distress and possible metabolic acidosis secondary to liver failure and lactate elevation. A SpO2 of 92% on 2L NC is below the target range (95-100%), indicating hypoxemia. A temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) indicates a fever, potentially related to infection, which is a significant concern in liver failure due to impaired immune function. The ammonia level of 180 mcg/dL is significantly elevated, contributing to hepatic encephalopathy.",
    "incorrect": "The sodium level of 130 mEq/L is slightly low (hyponatremia), but not the most critical finding requiring *immediate* intervention; it contributes to the overall clinical picture but is less acute than the vital sign derangements. The potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L is elevated (hyperkalemia) and warrants attention, but given the other more acute findings, it is less critical in the context of this question, which asks for the *most* immediate interventions. Elevated AST and ALT are expected findings in liver failure and are not as immediately life-threatening as the vital sign abnormalities or ammonia levels. An INR of 2.5 indicates impaired coagulation but is expected with liver failure. Lactulose and Rifaximin are appropriate medications, but do not contribute to worsening condition. The patient's BUN and creatinine are elevated but not the MOST immediate findings to address.",
