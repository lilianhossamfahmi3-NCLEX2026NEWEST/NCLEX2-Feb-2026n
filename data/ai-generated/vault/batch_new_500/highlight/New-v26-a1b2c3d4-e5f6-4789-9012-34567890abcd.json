An SpO2 of 88% on 2L NC signifies hypoxia, necessitating increased oxygen support to prevent tissue damage. A respiratory rate of 28 is indicative of tachypnea, likely due to pulmonary edema and the body's attempt to compensate for hypoxia. Urine output of 20 mL/hr demonstrates decreased renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. A potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.",
            "incorrect": "A temperature of 37.2°C (oral) is within normal limits and does not require immediate intervention. A sodium level of 132 mEq/L indicates hyponatremia, but it is not an immediate threat to the patient's stability. While elevated, a BNP of 1500 pg/mL is expected in heart failure and does not require immediate action beyond monitoring the response to treatment. A troponin level of 0.04 ng/mL is slightly elevated but not indicative of an acute MI in the context of ADHF. The focus should be on addressing the acute decompensation.",
