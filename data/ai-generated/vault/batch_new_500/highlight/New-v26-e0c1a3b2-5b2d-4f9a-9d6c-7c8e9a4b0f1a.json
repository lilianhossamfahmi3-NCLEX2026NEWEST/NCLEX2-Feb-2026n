    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 78-year-old male, was admitted three days ago for pneumonia and is now exhibiting altered mental status, potentially indicating a worsening condition. B: His medical history includes COPD and hypertension. He has been treated with IV antibiotics for pneumonia, but urosepsis is now suspected given his clinical presentation. He has had a temperature increase over the last four hours. A: At 08:00, his vital signs were: Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C), HR 120 bpm, RR 28, BP 90/50 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on 2L NC. The patient appears confused and lethargic. Urine is noted to be cloudy and foul-smelling. Lab results show a WBC count of 18,000/µL and a Lactate level of 3.0 mmol/L. P: I am requesting an immediate evaluation for possible sepsis. I recommend obtaining blood cultures, increasing IV fluid administration, and considering vasopressors if hypotension persists. Further investigation into the source of infection is also warranted.",

Hypotension (BP 90/50 mmHg) is a hallmark sign of sepsis and septic shock. Tachycardia (HR 120 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of hypovolemia and decreased vascular resistance. Fever (Temp 102.5°F) is a common systemic response to infection.",
    "incorrect": "While elevated creatinine and BUN can be associated with sepsis due to kidney injury, they are not primary diagnostic criteria for sepsis itself. They indicate organ dysfunction secondary to sepsis. The patient's report of pain (2/10) is important for overall assessment but not directly indicative of sepsis. While SpO2 of 92% on 2L NC is slightly below optimal, it is not a primary indicator of sepsis compared to the other findings. Furthermore, acetaminophen administration is not a direct indicator of sepsis.",
