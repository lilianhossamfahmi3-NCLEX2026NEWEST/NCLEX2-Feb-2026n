        "correct": "Elevated WBC count (18,000/µL) indicates an active infection. Elevated lactate levels (3.0 mmol/L) suggest tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, common in sepsis. Hypotension (BP 90/50 mmHg) is a hallmark sign of sepsis and septic shock. Tachycardia (HR 120 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of hypovolemia and decreased vascular resistance. Fever (Temp 102.5°F) is a common systemic response to infection. Cloudy, foul-smelling urine with +Leukocytes and +Nitrites suggests a urinary tract infection, a potential source of sepsis.",
        "incorrect": "While elevated creatinine and BUN can be associated with sepsis due to kidney injury, they are not primary diagnostic criteria for sepsis itself; they indicate organ dysfunction secondary to sepsis. The patient's report of pain (2/10) is important for overall assessment but not directly indicative of sepsis. While SpO2 of 92% on 2L NC is slightly below optimal, it is not a primary indicator of sepsis compared to the other findings. Furthermore, acetaminophen administration is not a direct indicator of sepsis. Chest X-ray showing infiltrates indicates pneumonia, the admitting diagnosis, but does not directly confirm sepsis; it only suggests a possible source.",
