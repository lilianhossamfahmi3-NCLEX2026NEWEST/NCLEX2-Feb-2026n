His adult child reports he lives alone in a rural area with limited access to fresh food, which may impact his baseline nutritional status. Over the last 4 hours, his temperature has spiked, and his blood pressure has trended downward despite a 500 mL fluid bolus given at 06:00.\n\nASSESSMENT: He is lethargic and disoriented to time and place. Current vitals are: T 102.5°F (39.2°C), HR 122, RR 28, BP 90/50 mmHg (MAP 63), SpO₂ 92% on 2L NC. Urine is cloudy and foul-smelling. Recent labs show WBC 18,000/mm³ and a serum lactate of 3.0 mmol/L.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I am concerned he is developing septic shock, likely from a urosepsis source. I recommend a 30 mL/kg fluid bolus, obtaining blood cultures before the next antibiotic dose, and a stat order for norepinephrine if his MAP remains below 65 mmHg after fluid resuscitation."
