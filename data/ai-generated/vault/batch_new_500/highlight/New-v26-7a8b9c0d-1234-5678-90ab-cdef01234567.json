B: Found at home by her daughter; reportedly not taking her medications for the past week. Daughter states pt. was increasingly confused and lethargic. A: At 07:00, patient is somnolent, but arousable to painful stimuli. Current blood glucose is 980 mg/dL. Serum Osmolality 340 mOsm/kg. Urine output minimal since admission. Respiratory rate is 24 and shallow. BP is 90/50 mmHg, HR 110 bpm. R: I'm concerned about worsening dehydration and potential for cardiovascular collapse. I recommend immediate fluid resuscitation and possible transfer to ICU for closer monitoring. Will need orders for electrolyte replacement based on lab results.",

A heart rate of 110 bpm indicates the body is attempting to compensate for the decreased blood pressure, further stressing the cardiovascular system. Decreasing oxygen saturation (96% to 93%) suggests impaired gas exchange, likely due to dehydration and possible pulmonary edema. The potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L is critically low and requires immediate correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
