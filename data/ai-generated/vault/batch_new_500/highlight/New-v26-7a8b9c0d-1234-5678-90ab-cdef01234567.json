The client lives alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, which limits her access to groceries. She reports often running out of fresh food and medication refills. \nA: On admission, client was lethargic but arousable to voice. Mucous membranes dry. Skin turgor poor. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Initial vitals: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 100 bpm, RR 22/min, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 99.0°F (37.2°C). \nR: Initiated IV access and began 0.9% sodium chloride infusion. Awaiting initial lab results. Neuro checks ordered every hour.\n\nProgress Note - 07:00\nS: Client's mental status has declined over the past three hours. \nB: History of Type 2 Diabetes with medication non-adherence. Social determinants of health include mobility issues and potential food insecurity impacting disease management. \nA: Client is now [somnolent, arousable only to painful stimuli]. Current [blood glucose is 980 mg/dL], and [serum Osmolality is 340 mOsm/kg]. [Urine output has been minimal] (less than 20 mL/hr) since admission. Vital signs show a worsening trend: [BP is 90/50 mmHg] (MAP 63), [HR is 110 bpm], RR is 24/min and shallow, [SpO2 is 93% on room air]. Critical lab value reported: [Potassium of 3.0 mEq/L]. \nR: The client is showing signs of hypovolemic shock and severe electrolyte imbalance. Recommend immediate transfer to ICU for intensive monitoring, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte replacement prior to initiating insulin therapy. Notified provider of critical findings."
