A: History of preeclampsia during this pregnancy, well-controlled with oral labetalol. She received magnesium sulfate during labor per preeclampsia protocol. Estimated blood loss (EBL) during delivery was 600 mL. B: Patient had preeclampsia during pregnancy. Prolonged labor and magnesium sulfate administration increase risk for uterine atony. T: 08:00: Patient reports feeling weak and dizzy. Fundus is boggy and difficult to locate, approximately 2 cm above the umbilicus, and deviated to the right. Moderate lochia rubra with several small clots noted. Vital signs: BP 150/95, HR 110, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. Foley catheter in place, draining 30 mL/hr. Labetalol held this morning due to elevated blood pressure. Lactated Ringers infusing at 125 mL/hr. Patient rates pain as 2/10.",

    "correct": "The patient's presentation, including history of preeclampsia, prolonged labor, elevated blood pressure, boggy fundus, moderate lochia with clots, elevated heart rate, and decreasing hemoglobin/hematocrit, strongly suggests postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. Methylergonovine is a uterotonic medication used to contract the uterus and control postpartum bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of ergot toxicity (nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle weakness, seizures, increased blood pressure) is essential, especially given her preeclampsia history and potential hypertensive effects of the medication. The sustained elevated blood pressure warrants monitoring for further increases.",
    "incorrect": "Oxytocin is already infusing; while continuing it is important, a different uterotonic is needed to address the unresponsive boggy fundus. Misoprostol is a uterotonic, but typically not first-line for a boggy uterus in this scenario. Carboprost is a potent uterotonic but is contraindicated in patients with hypertension, making it a less appropriate initial choice. Delaying treatment to focus solely on vital signs without addressing the uterine atony could lead to further blood loss and compromise the patient's condition. Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia, not the immediate concern, although the patient remains at risk. Fluids are important for volume replacement, but the priority is to stop the bleeding. Hypotension is not the primary concern given the patient's elevated blood pressure. While urine output is important to monitor, it is not the most immediate concern. Pain management is secondary to addressing the hemorrhage.",
