The critically high ammonia level (180 mcg/dL) confirms this. The priority is to lower ammonia using lactulose, which acidifies the gut, traps ammonia as non-absorbable ammonium, and promotes its excretion. If the significant ascites compromises respiratory function or is refractory to diuretics, a therapeutic paracentesis is the next anticipated intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Focusing on the client's electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) or other abnormal labs like bilirubin would be an error in prioritization. While these issues require management, they are not the direct cause of the acute, life-threatening neurological decline. Interventions like furosemide or albumin do not address the root cause of HE. Procedures like endoscopy or TIPS are inappropriate for the immediate clinical problem.",
