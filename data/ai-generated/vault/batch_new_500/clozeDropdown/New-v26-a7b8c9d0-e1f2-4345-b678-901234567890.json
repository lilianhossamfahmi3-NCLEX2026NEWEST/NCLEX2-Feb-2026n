  "stem": "Mr. Johnson is at increased risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. Based on his current assessment and lab values, the nurse should first address the [cloze-1] level, as this is a primary contributor to the altered mental status. Elevated levels of this substance cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological dysfunction. To manage this, the nurse should prepare to administer [cloze-2] to decrease the production of ammonia in the gut. If the patient does not respond to initial treatments, the nurse should anticipate an order for [cloze-3] to remove excess fluid and potentially decrease ammonia levels.",

B: Mr. Johnson has a five-year history of cirrhosis. He is currently exhibiting signs of confusion and asterixis. A: At 07:00, the patient is disoriented to time and place. His vital signs are BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, and Temp 37.8°C. His abdomen is distended with a positive fluid wave. Lab results show Ammonia 180 mcg/dL (high), Na 130 mEq/L (low), K 3.4 mEq/L (low), Albumin 2.8 g/dL (low), and Bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL (high). At 07:15, the patient attempted to climb out of bed. I have initiated droplet precautions due to altered mental status of unknown etiology. R: I recommend the provider be contacted regarding the patient's mental status changes, elevated ammonia levels, and electrolyte imbalances. We should consider initiating lactulose and potentially performing a paracentesis.",

    "correct": "Elevated ammonia levels are a primary cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is the first-line treatment to reduce ammonia production. Paracentesis is indicated if fluid overload contributes to the patient's condition and can indirectly lower ammonia levels by improving overall liver function and reducing portal hypertension. Addressing the ammonia level is crucial to improving the patient's mental status and preventing further neurological damage.",
    "incorrect": "While sodium and potassium imbalances can contribute to neurological symptoms, the elevated ammonia level is the most immediate threat in this scenario. Addressing the ammonia first is the priority. Albumin is low but does not directly cause the encephalopathy. While important for overall fluid balance, it is not the immediate priority. Paracentesis addresses ascites which can contribute to the overall clinical picture, but addressing the ammonia level directly is the most important initial intervention.",
