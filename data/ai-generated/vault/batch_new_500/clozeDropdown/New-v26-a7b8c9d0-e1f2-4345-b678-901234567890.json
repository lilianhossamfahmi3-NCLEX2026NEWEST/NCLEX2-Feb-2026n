        "stem": "Mr. Johnson is at increased risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. Based on his current assessment and lab values, the nurse should first address the [cloze-1] level, as this is a primary contributor to the altered mental status. Elevated levels of this substance cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological dysfunction. To manage this, the nurse should prepare to administer [cloze-2] to decrease the production of ammonia in the gut. If the patient does not respond to initial treatments, the nurse should anticipate an order for [cloze-3] to remove excess fluid and potentially decrease ammonia levels.",

Lactulose is the first-line treatment to reduce ammonia production by acidifying the colon, converting ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), which is then excreted in the stool. Paracentesis is indicated if fluid overload contributes to the patient's condition and can indirectly lower ammonia levels by improving overall liver function and reducing portal hypertension. Addressing the ammonia level is crucial to improving the patient's mental status and preventing further neurological damage.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor for hypokalemia as a side effect of lactulose due to increased bowel movements.",

Addressing the ammonia first is the priority. Albumin is low but does not directly cause the encephalopathy. While important for overall fluid balance, it is not the immediate priority. Paracentesis addresses ascites which can contribute to the overall clinical picture, but addressing the ammonia level directly is the most important initial intervention.\n\nquestionTrap: Focusing solely on electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) and overlooking the significantly elevated ammonia level. Prioritize interventions based on the immediate threat to the patient's neurological status.
