        "correct": "The patient's increased heart rate, respiratory rate, crackles, and elevated BNP level suggest fluid overload post-VSD repair, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is indicated to reduce pulmonary congestion by promoting fluid excretion. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the diuretic. Signs of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and EKG changes, must be reported promptly as furosemide can deplete potassium levels. Hypokalemia can further compromise cardiac function and exacerbate complications.",
        "incorrect": "Withholding furosemide would exacerbate the fluid overload and worsen pulmonary edema. Administering morphine is not the priority in this situation and could further depress respirations, increasing the risk of respiratory failure. Increasing oxygen flow rate is not the primary intervention to address fluid overload; it only treats the symptom of hypoxemia. Administering potassium without lab values is dangerous and can lead to hyperkalemia, potentially causing cardiac arrest. Monitoring blood pressure alone is insufficient to assess the effectiveness of the diuretic; urine output and electrolyte levels are more indicative of fluid balance.",
