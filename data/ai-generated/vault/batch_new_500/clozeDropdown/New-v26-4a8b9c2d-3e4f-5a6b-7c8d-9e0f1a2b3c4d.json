Pre-operative echocardiogram confirmed the defect and showed moderate pulmonary hypertension. The family lives in a rural area with limited access to pediatric cardiology follow-up, which has complicated chronic management. Surgery was completed without any immediate intraoperative complications. \nA: Patient is intubated and sedated upon arrival from the OR. Initial vital signs are stable. Chest tube is in place with minimal serosanguinous drainage. Peripheral IVs are patent. \nR: Plan is to monitor hemodynamic stability, manage pain and sedation, and wean from mechanical ventilation as tolerated over the next 24-48 hours. Strict intake and output monitoring initiated."

The patient is becoming increasingly restless and tachypneic over the last two hours. \nB: Patient was extubated yesterday evening. IV fluids are infusing at 75 mL/hr. Last dose of PRN furosemide was administered at 00:00. The adult child of the patient is at the bedside and expresses concern about his rapid breathing. \nA: Vital signs show a trend of increasing tachycardia and tachypnea, with SpO2 decreasing to 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Physical assessment reveals bilateral crackles at the lung bases and a new S3 gallop. Skin is cool and clammy. 1+ pitting edema noted in lower extremities. Chest tube output is minimal. BNP is elevated at 350 pg/mL. These findings are consistent with developing fluid volume excess and pulmonary edema. \nR: Recommend administering the prescribed PRN furosemide to promote diuresis. Continue to closely monitor respiratory status, urine output, and electrolytes. Notify provider of any worsening respiratory distress or signs of electrolyte imbalance."

The priority intervention is to reduce the excess fluid. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is the correct medication to administer. Its primary therapeutic goal is to reduce cardiac preload by promoting diuresis, which alleviates pulmonary congestion. The most direct measure of its effectiveness is increased urine output. A significant adverse effect of furosemide is potassium depletion (hypokalemia), which can manifest as muscle cramping or weakness and must be reported immediately.",

Morphine is inappropriate as it can cause respiratory depression, which is hazardous in a patient already showing signs of respiratory compromise. While oxygen saturation is a concern, simply increasing the oxygen flow treats a symptom, not the underlying cause (pulmonary edema); the primary goal is to remove fluid. Monitoring heart rate or blood pressure alone is insufficient to evaluate diuretic effectiveness; urine output is the key indicator.
