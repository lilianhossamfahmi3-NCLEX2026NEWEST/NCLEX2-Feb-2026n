His 0600 vital signs are: HR 140, RR 36, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, and BP 110/70.\nB: Liam was diagnosed with a VSD at 3 months old and has a history of frequent respiratory infections. A pre-operative echo revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. The surgical repair itself was uncomplicated.\nA: The patient is currently restless and coughing frequently. Auscultation reveals crackles in bilateral lung bases. Chest tube output has been minimal, only 10 mL in the last hour. IV fluids are infusing at 75 mL/hr. The last dose of furosemide was administered at 0000.\nR: Please evaluate the patient for potential fluid overload and consider adjusting the diuretic regimen accordingly. Closely monitor his respiratory status, reporting any signs of deterioration immediately. Continue administering current medications as prescribed. Implement droplet precautions due to frequent coughing and respiratory distress.",

    "correct": "The patient's increased heart rate, respiratory rate, crackles, and elevated BNP level suggest fluid overload post-VSD repair. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is indicated to reduce pulmonary congestion. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the diuretic. Signs of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and EKG changes, must be reported promptly as furosemide can deplete potassium levels.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding furosemide would exacerbate the fluid overload. Administering morphine is not the priority in this situation and could further depress respirations. Increasing oxygen flow rate is not the primary intervention to address fluid overload. Administering potassium without lab values is dangerous and can lead to hyperkalemia. Monitoring blood pressure alone is insufficient to assess the effectiveness of the diuretic.",
