    "sbar": "SBAR: Mr. Michael Jones, a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the ICU at 06:00. He presented with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm, suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). At 07:15, the patient reports increased shortness of breath, and his oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. His blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, and respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min. He appears anxious and is diaphoretic. Initial troponin levels were elevated at 0.8 ng/mL, and his BNP is 800 pg/mL, indicating heart failure. Current medications include aspirin 325mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID, and atorvastatin 80mg daily. Auscultation reveals audible crackles bilaterally, suggesting pulmonary edema. Current orders include oxygen per nasal cannula, furosemide IV PRN, and morphine IV PRN for pain. He rates his pain as 8/10. The priority is to address his respiratory distress and potential acute decompensated heart failure.",

    "correct": "The patient presents with signs of ADHF secondary to a possible MI, characterized by dyspnea, elevated BNP, and crackles. Administering oxygen is the immediate priority to address hypoxemia. Furosemide is the next priority to reduce preload and alleviate pulmonary edema. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is crucial to identify ST-segment changes indicating the location and extent of the MI, guiding further treatment such as PCI or thrombolytics. Continuous monitoring of potassium is necessary after administering furosemide because it is a potassium-wasting diuretic.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying oxygen administration can lead to further hypoxia and compromise tissue perfusion. Obtaining an ECG before addressing the patient's breathing difficulties could be detrimental. While morphine can help with pain and anxiety, it should be administered after addressing the more pressing issues of oxygenation and fluid overload. Notifying the physician is important, but initial interventions should be implemented first based on standing orders and nursing judgment.",
