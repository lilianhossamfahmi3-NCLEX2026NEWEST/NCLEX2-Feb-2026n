Second, administering 100% oxygen via face mask maximizes the amount of oxygen available for gas exchange. Third, Morphine Sulfate is given to reduce infundibular spasm (spasm of the muscle below the pulmonary valve), which decreases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and further improves pulmonary blood flow.
