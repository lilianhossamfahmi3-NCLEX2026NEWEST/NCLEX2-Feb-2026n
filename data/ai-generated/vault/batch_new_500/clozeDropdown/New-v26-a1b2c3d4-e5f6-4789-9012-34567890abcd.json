  "stem": "A client with a T6 spinal cord injury is being assessed. The client reports a severe headache and blurred vision. Upon assessment, the nurse notes the client is diaphoretic and has nasal congestion. The client's blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, and heart rate is 52 bpm. Based on these findings, the nurse should recognize the client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. The priority nursing intervention is to first elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to address the [cloze-1]. The next action should be to [cloze-2]. Following this, the nurse should assess for and relieve the [cloze-3], which is the most common trigger for this condition. The nurse should also administer [cloze-4] as prescribed by the provider to address the client's hypertension.",

    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 45-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury, admitted for a routine check-up, is now reporting a severe, throbbing headache and blurred vision. Background: The patient has a history of autonomic dysreflexia related to his spinal cord injury, which occurred in a motor vehicle accident two years ago. He understands the condition and its potential triggers. Assessment: At 08:00, his BP was 120/80 mmHg and HR was 72 bpm. At 08:30, his BP is 210/110 mmHg and HR is 52 bpm. The patient is diaphoretic, reports nasal congestion, and appears anxious. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Recommendation: I believe the patient is experiencing an acute episode of autonomic dysreflexia. I recommend immediate intervention to lower his blood pressure and identify and alleviate the underlying cause. I have already notified the provider and am awaiting further orders, specifically regarding antihypertensive medication administration.",

    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a potentially life-threatening condition unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. Elevating the head of the bed is the first action to lower the blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Identifying and removing the noxious stimuli, such as bladder distention, is paramount to resolving the episode. Medications such as hydralazine are administered to lower blood pressure rapidly when non-pharmacological interventions are insufficient. The dangerously increased blood pressure requires immediate attention to prevent stroke or other severe complications.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to elevate the head of the bed as the FIRST action will delay the drop in blood pressure and can worsen the condition. Delaying assessment for noxious stimuli prolongs the episode and increases the risk of complications. Waiting to administer medications can cause further complications such as stroke or seizures. Not recognizing the urgency of this condition is dangerous and can lead to significant morbidity or mortality.",
