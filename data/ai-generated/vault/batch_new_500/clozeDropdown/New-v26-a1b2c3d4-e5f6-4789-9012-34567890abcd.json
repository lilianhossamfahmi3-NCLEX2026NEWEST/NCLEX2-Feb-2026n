Based on the provided data, select the most appropriate nursing interventions to address the infant's condition during a hypercyanotic spell.\n\nDuring a hypercyanotic spell, immediately place the infant in a [cloze-1] position. This action helps to increase systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary blood flow. Next, administer [cloze-2] via face mask as prescribed. This intervention aims to increase the amount of oxygen available to the tissues. Finally, the nurse should administer [cloze-3] IV as ordered. This medication helps to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve pulmonary blood flow.",

His mother is visibly anxious and asking questions about what is happening.\n\n1502: B - Oliver was admitted yesterday for elective surgical repair of his Tetralogy of Fallot. He has a history of cyanotic episodes, which are usually managed with positional changes and oxygen as needed. He has no other significant medical history.\n\n1504: A - Currently, Oliver is irritable and demonstrating increased respiratory effort with a respiratory rate of 60. His heart rate is 180, and his SpO2 is 68%. His color appears dusky. Vitals are trending downward despite attempting knee-chest positioning by the parents. Auscultation reveals a harsh systolic murmur.\n\n1506: R - There is an order for Morphine Sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV PRN for hypercyanotic spell. We are requesting immediate guidance on the most appropriate interventions and confirmation regarding the medication administration protocol. We are also considering involving the rapid response team if his condition does not improve quickly. Do you have any further orders or recommendations?",

            "correct": "During a hypercyanotic spell (also known as a Tet spell), the priority is to improve oxygenation and reduce pulmonary vascular resistance. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which in turn decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the ventricular septal defect, thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow and oxygen saturation. Administering 100% oxygen via face mask maximizes the oxygen available for uptake. Morphine sulfate is administered to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant, further reducing oxygen demand. Propranolol is less effective acutely during a Tet spell.\n\nclinicalPearl: Knee-chest position should be taught to parents of infants with Tetralogy of Fallot to manage hypercyanotic spells at home.",
            "incorrect": "Incorrect options do not address the immediate physiological needs during a hypercyanotic spell. While monitoring vital signs is important, it is not the primary intervention. Administering propranolol is more useful in preventing spells and controlling heart rate, but it's not the first-line treatment for an acute episode. Increasing IV fluids might be considered later to improve blood volume, but it's not the priority during the initial management of the spell. Starting an IV is crucial for medication administration, but the positioning and oxygen are the immediate priorities.\n\nclinicalPearl: Morphine is used judiciously in Tet spells due to the risk of respiratory depression, but the benefit of reducing pulmonary vascular resistance often outweighs the risk in this acute situation.",
