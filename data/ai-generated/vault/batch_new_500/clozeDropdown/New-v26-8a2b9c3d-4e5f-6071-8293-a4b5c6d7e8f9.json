Based on the assessment data, the priority nursing intervention is to position Michael in a [cloze-1] position. This action helps to [cloze-2] systemic vascular resistance, which in turn [cloze-3] pulmonary blood flow. Administering [cloze-4] via mask as prescribed will help increase SpO2, while also calming him. The parents should also be educated about the importance of [cloze-5] to prevent future hypercyanotic spells and understand when to seek immediate medical attention.",

        "sbar": "SITUATION: Baby Michael, a 6-month-old male with Tetralogy of Fallot, was admitted for observation and is now experiencing a hypercyanotic spell. BACKGROUND: Michael has generally been stable, maintaining SpO2 levels between 80-85%. At 14:15 today, his mother reported a sudden increase in cyanosis and labored breathing. He has a history of similar episodes. ASSESSMENT: At 14:20, Michael's respiratory rate is 60 and labored. His SpO2 is 65%, and his heart rate is 180 bpm. He is crying inconsolably and presents with dusky skin. Prior to this episode, his vital signs were stable. His mother reports he had just finished feeding. Auscultation reveals a loud murmur, consistent with his known heart defect. Lab results show normal electrolytes but elevated hemoglobin (18 g/dL) and hematocrit (55%). The current medication order is Morphine Sulfate 0.1mg/kg IM PRN for hypercyanotic spells, and Oxygen 2L via face mask PRN. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate intervention for this hypercyanotic spell. The priority is to place him in the knee-chest position, administer morphine as prescribed, and provide supplemental oxygen. We also need to educate the parents on managing these episodes at home, including recognizing early signs and symptoms and knowing when to seek emergency care. Continuous monitoring is essential.",

        "correct": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position is crucial during a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell) because it increases systemic vascular resistance. This increase diverts blood flow back to the lungs for oxygenation, thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow and improving oxygen saturation. Morphine helps reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and calms the infant, reducing oxygen demand. Educating parents on preventing triggers like dehydration or overexertion is crucial for home management and recognizing the need for emergency interventions. Quick intervention is vital to prevent severe hypoxia and potential neurological damage.",
        "incorrect": "Other positions might hinder blood return to the heart or lungs. While oxygen is important, positioning takes precedence in this situation. Not understanding the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot can lead to incorrect interventions. Lack of parental education leaves them unprepared to manage future episodes and recognize emergency situations. Delaying intervention can have severe consequences.",
