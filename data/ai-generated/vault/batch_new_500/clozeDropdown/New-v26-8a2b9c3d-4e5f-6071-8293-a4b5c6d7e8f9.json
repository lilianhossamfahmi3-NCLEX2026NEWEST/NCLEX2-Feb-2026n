They live in a rural area with limited access to pediatric cardiology and rely on public transport, which can delay seeking care.\nASSESSMENT: On admission, infant is calm. HR 140, RR 30, SpO2 82% on room air. Mild perioral cyanosis noted. Weight is appropriate for age. Parents appear anxious but are receptive to teaching.\nRECOMMENDATION: Admit to pediatric unit for continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Plan for cardiology consult in the morning. Reinforce parental education on recognizing and managing hypercyanotic spells."
