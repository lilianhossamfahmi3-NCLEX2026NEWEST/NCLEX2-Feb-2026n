Adjust the tidal volume to [{2: options: [4 mL/kg, 6 mL/kg, 8 mL/kg], solution: 6 mL/kg}] to reduce the risk of volutrauma.\n3. Consider the use of [{3: options: [neuromuscular blockade, bronchodilators, mucolytics], solution: neuromuscular blockade}] to improve ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen consumption.",

    "correct": "Increasing the FiO2 to 60% is a reasonable initial step to improve oxygenation, but it's important to monitor the patient's response and avoid excessive oxygen concentrations. Reducing tidal volume to 6 mL/kg is a key strategy in ARDS to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Neuromuscular blockade helps to improve ventilator synchrony, reduce oxygen consumption by respiratory muscles, and facilitate lung protective ventilation strategies.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing FiO2 beyond 60% may lead to oxygen toxicity without significant improvement if other interventions aren't taken. Using a higher tidal volume (8mL/kg) increases the risk of volutrauma in the setting of ARDS. While bronchodilators and mucolytics might be useful in other respiratory conditions, they are not the primary interventions for ARDS. They don't directly address the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS, which involves inflammation and alveolar damage.",
