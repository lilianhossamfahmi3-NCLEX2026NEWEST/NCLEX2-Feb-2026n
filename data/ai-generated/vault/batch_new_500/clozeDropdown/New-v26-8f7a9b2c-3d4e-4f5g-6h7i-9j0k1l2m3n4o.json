Found by a neighbor who was concerned after not hearing from her. EMS noted extreme diaphoresis, tachycardia, and confusion.\n\nAssessment: On admission at 07:00, client is restless, disoriented to time and place, with marked tremors. Vital signs are grossly abnormal: HR 180 bpm (sinus tachycardia), BP 190/110 mmHg, RR 32/min, Temp 104.5°F (40.3°C), SpO₂ 92% on room air. GCS is 12. Cardiac monitor shows frequent PVCs. Skin is hot and flushed.\n\nRecommendation: Continue cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Anticipate STAT orders for antithyroid medications, beta-blockers, IV fluids, and aggressive cooling measures. Prepare for potential intubation if respiratory status declines. Notify endocrinology for an urgent consult."

The priority is to block the systemic effects of excess thyroid hormone using beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) to control heart rate and blood pressure, and to inhibit new hormone synthesis with antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole).
