B: Patient found at home confused and diaphoretic. Glucose via glucometer was HI. EMS report indicates rapid heart rate and agitation. Patient was not wearing a mask. A: 07:00 assessment reveals: HR 180 bpm, BP 190/110 mmHg, RR 32 breaths/min (deep and rapid), Temp 104.5°F (40.3°C). Patient is restless, confused, and exhibiting tremors. STAT lab results are pending. O2 saturation is 92% on room air. Droplet precautions initiated due to elevated temperature and unknown infectious etiology. P: Anticipate orders for IV fluids, cooling measures, and medications to address potential thyroid storm. Monitor for signs of respiratory distress and cardiac arrhythmias.

    "correct": "The patient's presentation (fever, tachycardia, hypertension, altered mental status, low TSH, high Free T4) is most consistent with thyroid storm, a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. The priority nursing intervention is to manage the hyperthermia and cardiovascular instability. This includes administering antithyroid medications (PTU or methimazole), beta-blockers (propranolol) to control heart rate, and cooling measures to reduce fever. Untreated thyroid storm can lead to heart failure and death.",
    "incorrect": "DKA and HHS are incorrect because while hyperglycemia is present, the primary driver of the patient's condition is the thyroid hormone excess. Although the patient has acidosis, it is not the primary problem. The patient’s labs show a low TSH and high Free T4 level, indicating hyperthyroidism. While managing hyperglycemia is important, it is not the priority over stabilizing the cardiovascular system and reducing thyroid hormone levels. Hypothyroidism is the opposite of the patient’s presentation. The patient has hyperthermia, tachycardia, and elevated Free T4 levels.",
