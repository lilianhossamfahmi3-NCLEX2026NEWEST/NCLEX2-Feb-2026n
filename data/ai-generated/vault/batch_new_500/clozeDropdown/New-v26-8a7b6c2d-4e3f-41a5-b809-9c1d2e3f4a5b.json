The most immediate life-threatening complication of AKI is hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L), which is confirmed by the peaked T-waves on the ECG. This cardiac manifestation requires urgent intervention to prevent fatal dysrhythmias. While initial medical management (e.g., diuretics, insulin/dextrose) is attempted, the severity of the hyperkalemia and renal failure indicates that definitive treatment with hemodialysis is necessary to rapidly remove potassium and correct metabolic derangements.",
