Urine output has been minimal since surgery, less than 30mL in the last 4 hours. The surgical dressing is dry and intact, but his abdominal girth has increased. Labs show Hgb 8.2, Hct 25, and Lactate 3.5. A: I suspect hypovolemic shock secondary to possible internal bleeding or fluid shifts. The increased abdominal girth and low H&H support this assessment. B: Current orders include NS at 100mL/hr, pain meds PRN, and routine post-op care. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril prior to admission. The last dose of lisinopril was held pre-op. The patient is oriented to person only and complains of dizziness. His current pain level is 2/10.",

            "correct": "Hypovolemic shock is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's post-operative status, low hemoglobin/hematocrit levels suggesting blood loss, decreased urine output, and increasing abdominal girth, potentially indicating internal bleeding or fluid accumulation. The increased heart rate is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output when circulating volume is reduced. The falling blood pressure indicates decompensation, meaning the compensatory mechanisms are failing. Administering a crystalloid bolus is the priority nursing intervention to increase circulating volume and improve tissue perfusion. Rapid fluid replacement is essential in hypovolemic shock to restore adequate blood volume and prevent further deterioration. \n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor the patient closely for signs of fluid overload during fluid resuscitation, such as crackles in the lungs or increased work of breathing.",
            "incorrect": "Cardiogenic shock would be suspected if the patient had a history of heart failure or recent myocardial infarction, which is not indicated in this scenario. Septic shock would be suspected with signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, which are not the primary indicators here. Anaphylactic shock would be suspected with exposure to an allergen and signs of airway compromise and hives, which are also not present. While vasopressors, antihistamines, and bronchodilators may be indicated later in the patient's treatment, the priority is to address the hypovolemia with a crystalloid bolus. Vasopressors are typically used after fluid resuscitation has been initiated and is inadequate to maintain blood pressure. Antihistamines are used for allergic reactions, and bronchodilators are used for airway constriction. \n\nclinicalPearl: Early recognition and treatment of hypovolemic shock are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage and improve patient outcomes.",

In hypovolemic shock, restoring circulating volume is the first step to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion.
