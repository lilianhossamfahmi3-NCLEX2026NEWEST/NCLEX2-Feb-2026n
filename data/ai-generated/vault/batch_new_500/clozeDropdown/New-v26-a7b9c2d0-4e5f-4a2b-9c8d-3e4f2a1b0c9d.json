The priority is to manage factors that increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and the risk of bleeding. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous outflow from the brain, a non-invasive method to lower ICP. The critical hypertension must be treated immediately with an IV antihypertensive like Labetalol, as per the PRN order, to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion of the ischemic stroke. This complication, bleeding into the area of infarction, is the most likely cause of the rapid deterioration.",
