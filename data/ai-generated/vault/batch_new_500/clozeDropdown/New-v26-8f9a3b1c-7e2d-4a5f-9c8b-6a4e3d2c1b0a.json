    "sbar": "Situation: Thomas Jones, a 68-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, was admitted yesterday for worsening ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Background: Mr. Jones has a long history of alcohol abuse and has been diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis. He has been treated with lactulose and spironolactone in the past. Assessment: At 0600, patient reports increased shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort. Abdomen is distended, and lower extremities exhibit 3+ pitting edema bilaterally. Vital signs: BP 100/60, HR 98, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. I&O from yesterday: Intake 2500 mL, Output 800 mL. Current weight is 85 kg, up from 82 kg on admission. Recommendation: Please assess Mr. Jones for fluid overload and consider adjusting diuretic therapy. Continue to monitor respiratory status and abdominal girth Q4H. Check ammonia level at 1200.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "1. Spironolactone: Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic commonly used in liver failure to treat ascites and edema. It antagonizes aldosterone, promoting sodium and water excretion while conserving potassium. 2. Strict I&O and daily weights: Monitoring fluid intake and output along with daily weights is crucial for assessing fluid balance and the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. This helps to titrate medications appropriately and prevent further complications. 3. Sodium: Restricting sodium intake is essential in managing fluid overload in patients with liver failure. Sodium promotes fluid retention, exacerbating ascites and edema. Limiting sodium intake helps to reduce fluid accumulation and alleviate symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "1. Lactulose/Furosemide/Neomycin: Lactulose is used to reduce ammonia levels in hepatic encephalopathy, not directly for fluid overload. Furosemide can be used but carries a higher risk of electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium depletion) and is not the first-line diuretic for liver failure due to potential complications. Neomycin is an antibiotic used to decrease ammonia production in the gut; it does not directly address fluid overload. 2. Encourage ambulation/Provide a high-sodium diet/Monitor for signs of infection: Ambulation is generally good but is not the priority intervention for acute fluid overload. A high-sodium diet would worsen fluid retention. Monitoring for infection is important but is not directly related to managing the fluid imbalance. 3. Protein/Potassium/Fiber: Protein restriction may be necessary in severe encephalopathy, but not primarily for fluid overload. Potassium restriction may be required in renal failure, but in this case, the patient is hypokalemic, so it is contraindicated. Fiber is important for bowel function but does not directly address fluid overload.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Spironolactone is often the preferred diuretic in liver failure due to its aldosterone-antagonizing effect, which is beneficial in counteracting the hyperaldosteronism seen in cirrhosis.",
      "Careful monitoring of electrolytes, especially potassium, is crucial when using diuretics in patients with liver failure.",
