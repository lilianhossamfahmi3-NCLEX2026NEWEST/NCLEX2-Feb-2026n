Background: Mr. Jones has a history of alcohol abuse and decompensated cirrhosis, previously treated with lactulose and spironolactone. Assessment: At 06:00, patient reports increased shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort. Abdomen is distended, lower extremities with 3+ pitting edema bilaterally. Vitals: BP 100/60, HR 98, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. I&O from yesterday: Intake 2500 mL, Output 800 mL. Weight is 85 kg, up from 82 kg on admission. Labs show elevated ammonia and bilirubin, low sodium, potassium, and albumin. Recommendation: Assess for fluid overload, adjust diuretic therapy, monitor respiratory status and abdominal girth Q4H. Check ammonia level at 12:00. Consider a low sodium diet.",

        "correct": "1. Spironolactone: Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic used to manage ascites and edema in liver failure. It blocks aldosterone, promoting sodium and water excretion while conserving potassium. This is crucial because hyperaldosteronism is common in cirrhosis. 2. Strict I&O and daily weights: Accurate monitoring of fluid intake and output, along with daily weights, is essential for assessing fluid balance and the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. This helps in adjusting medication dosages and preventing complications. 3. Sodium: Restricting sodium intake is vital in managing fluid overload in liver failure. Sodium promotes fluid retention, exacerbating ascites and edema. Limiting sodium intake reduces fluid accumulation and alleviates symptoms.\n\nclinicalPearl: Spironolactone is preferred due to its aldosterone-antagonizing effect, addressing the underlying hormonal imbalance in cirrhosis.\nmnemonic: \"Save Potassium\" - Spironolactone helps retain potassium while eliminating excess fluid.",
        "incorrect": "1. Lactulose/Furosemide/Neomycin: Lactulose reduces ammonia levels in hepatic encephalopathy, not directly fluid overload. Furosemide, while a diuretic, risks electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium depletion) and isn't first-line due to complications. Neomycin decreases ammonia production in the gut, not directly addressing fluid overload.\nquestionTrap: Lactulose is a common treatment for patients with liver failure, but it does not directly address fluid overload. Furosemide can cause electrolyte imbalances.\n2. Encourage ambulation/Provide a high-sodium diet/Monitor for signs of infection: Ambulation is generally beneficial but not the priority for acute fluid overload. A high-sodium diet worsens fluid retention. Monitoring for infection is important but not directly related to managing fluid imbalance.\nquestionTrap: All options are important nursing interventions, but only strict I&O and daily weights directly address the immediate problem of fluid overload.\n3. Protein/Potassium/Fiber: Protein restriction may be needed in severe encephalopathy, not primarily for fluid overload. Potassium is contraindicated as the patient is hypokalemic. Fiber supports bowel function but doesn't directly address fluid overload.\nquestionTrap: The patient is hypokalemic, making potassium restriction a dangerous choice.",
