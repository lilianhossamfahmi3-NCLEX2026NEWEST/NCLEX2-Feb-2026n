Furosemide, a loop diuretic, would be a poor choice as it can worsen the client's existing hypokalemia. Encouraging ambulation is not a priority and may be unsafe given the client's dyspnea and edema. A high-sodium diet is strictly contraindicated. While monitoring for infection is important, it is not the primary intervention for fluid management. Restricting protein is only indicated for severe, refractory encephalopathy. Restricting potassium is dangerous as the client is hypokalemic. Fluid restriction may be necessary, but sodium restriction is the priority intervention.",
