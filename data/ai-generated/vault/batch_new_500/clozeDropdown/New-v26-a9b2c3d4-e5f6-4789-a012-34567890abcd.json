B: History of chronic alcohol abuse, hypertension. Admitted previously for alcohol withdrawal. Currently on IV fluids, pain medication, and pancreatic enzymes. A: At 08:00, patient reports increased abdominal pain (9/10), guarding, and nausea. Noted diminished bowel sounds. Vitals: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.8°C. Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. R: I am concerned about worsening pancreatitis, possible sepsis, and impending respiratory failure. Requesting orders for repeat labs, possible CT scan, and increased oxygen support. Please advise. I also need an order for a calcium level check stat.",
