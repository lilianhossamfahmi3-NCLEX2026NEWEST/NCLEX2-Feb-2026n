His initial post-operative course was stable. At 13:00, increased work of breathing and mild cyanosis were noted. He has gained 0.5 kg since yesterday. ASSESSMENT: Current vital signs at 15:00: HR 130 bpm, RR 36, SpO2 88% on room air, BP 90/60 mmHg. Auscultation reveals mild crackles bilaterally. Lab results show normal electrolytes. He is scheduled for a dental cleaning tomorrow at 10:00. The physician was notified. RECOMMENDATION: Evaluate for a potential hypercyanotic spell, fluid overload, and the need for infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Consider ordering a chest x-ray and adjusting medications as needed. Continue to closely monitor vital signs and respiratory status. I will call back at 17:00 for an update.",
