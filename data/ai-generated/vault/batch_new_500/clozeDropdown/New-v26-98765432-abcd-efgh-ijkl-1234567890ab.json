BP is 88/52, HR 122, RR 28 and labored, SpO2 90% on 4L nasal cannula. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. Lactic acid is 4.2 mmol/L. Patient reports dizziness and weakness.\nB: Patient was transferred to the ICU at 06:00. At 07:00, his BP trended down despite a 1L normal saline bolus. Oxygen saturation decreased from 94% to 90%. The patient is increasingly lethargic.\nA: Pneumonia, possible sepsis, leading to septic shock. Elevated WBC, lactate, and procalcitonin support this assessment. He is hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring close monitoring and intervention.\nR: Physician is aware of the situation. Orders received for norepinephrine initiation if systolic BP remains below 90 mmHg. Repeat labs have been ordered. Current IV fluids are infusing at 75 mL/hr. Last dose of Ceftriaxone was given at 05:00.",

    "correct": "The patient exhibits signs of septic shock, indicated by elevated WBC, lactate, procalcitonin, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The initial compensatory mechanism failing is likely vasoconstriction, leading to decreased blood pressure despite increased heart rate. Initiating vasopressors, specifically norepinephrine, is the most appropriate intervention to increase blood pressure and improve tissue perfusion in septic shock.  The patient's pneumonia is the most likely source of the infection leading to sepsis.",
    "incorrect": "Cardiogenic shock would be indicated by signs of heart failure such as JVD, edema, and abnormal heart sounds, which are not present. Hypovolemic shock would be more likely with significant fluid loss, which is not indicated here; the patient received a fluid bolus. Neurogenic shock is usually associated with spinal cord injury. Compensatory mechanisms include increased heart rate and vasoconstriction. Fluid resuscitation alone is often insufficient in septic shock; vasopressors are needed to counteract vasodilation. Diuretics would worsen hypotension. Antipyretics address fever but do not treat the underlying shock.",
