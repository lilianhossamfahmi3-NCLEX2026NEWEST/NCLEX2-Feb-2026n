The last known well time was yesterday at 22:00.\nB: He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. His current medications include warfarin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.\nA: At 09:00, the patient is drowsy but arousable to verbal stimuli. Right-sided hemiparesis is present. His GCS is 13 (E3, V4, M6). His BP is 180/100, HR is 92, RR is 22, SpO2 is 94% on room air, and temperature is 37.5°C. A CT scan revealed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke with surrounding edema. The neurosurgeon has been consulted.\nR: Continue close monitoring of neurological status. Manage blood pressure per stroke protocol, maintaining SBP <160. Administer prescribed medications. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Prepare for possible interventions to manage ICP.",

        "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed (HOB) at 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. This position aids in decreasing cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure. Administering Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, helps to reduce cerebral edema and ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the bloodstream, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Frequent neurological assessments, including GCS and pupillary response, are essential to monitor for changes in ICP and guide further interventions. Assessing motor strength is also crucial in determining the progression of stroke and any further deterioration, allowing for timely adjustments in the treatment plan.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor serum osmolality when administering Mannitol to avoid dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n",
        "incorrect": "Lowering the HOB would increase ICP by increasing cerebral blood volume. While stool softeners can prevent straining, which can transiently increase ICP, they do not directly address the primary issue of increased ICP due to cerebral edema. A normal saline bolus could worsen cerebral edema by increasing intravascular volume and potentially exacerbating fluid accumulation in the brain tissue. Vital signs alone are not sufficient for a complete neurological assessment; GCS and pupillary response are vital components for evaluating the level of consciousness and brainstem function. Waiting to assess motor strength until the next shift could delay necessary interventions, as early detection of neurological changes is crucial in managing increased ICP and preventing further brain injury.\n\nclinicalPearl: Avoid hypotonic solutions in patients with increased ICP as they can exacerbate cerebral edema.\n",
