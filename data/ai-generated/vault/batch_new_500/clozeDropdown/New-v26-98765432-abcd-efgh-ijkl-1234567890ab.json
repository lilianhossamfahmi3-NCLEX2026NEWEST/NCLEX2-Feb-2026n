Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees uses gravity to promote venous drainage from the cranium, reducing cerebral blood volume. Administering Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, creates an osmotic gradient that pulls edematous fluid from brain tissue into the vasculature for excretion. Frequent, focused neurological assessments (GCS, pupils) are critical for early detection of deterioration.",
