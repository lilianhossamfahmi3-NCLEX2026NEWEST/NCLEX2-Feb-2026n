Last known well was yesterday at 22:00. \nB: History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Currently on warfarin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. \nA: At 09:00, patient is drowsy but arousable to verbal stimuli. Right-sided hemiparesis present. GCS is 13 (E3, V4, M6). BP 180/100, HR 92, RR 22, SpO2 94% on room air. Temperature 37.5°C. CT scan showed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke with some surrounding edema. Neurosurgeon consulted. \nR: Continue to monitor neurological status closely. Manage blood pressure per stroke protocol (maintain SBP <160). Administer prescribed medications. Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees. Prepare for possible interventions to manage ICP.",

    "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed (HOB) at 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, helps to reduce cerebral edema and ICP. Frequent neurological assessments, including GCS and pupillary response, are essential to monitor for changes in ICP and guide further interventions. Assessing motor strength is also crucial in determining the progression of stroke and any further deterioration.",
    "incorrect": "Lowering the HOB would increase ICP. While stool softeners can prevent straining, they do not directly address ICP. Normal saline bolus could worsen cerebral edema. Vital signs alone are not sufficient for a complete neurological assessment; GCS and pupillary response are vital. Waiting to assess motor strength could delay necessary interventions.",
