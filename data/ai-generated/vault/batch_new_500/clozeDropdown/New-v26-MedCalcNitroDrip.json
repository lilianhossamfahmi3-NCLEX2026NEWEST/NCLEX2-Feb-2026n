    "stem": "The physician orders a nitroglycerin drip at 10 mcg/min for Mr. Johnson, who is experiencing a hypertensive crisis. The pharmacy provides a solution of nitroglycerin 50 mg in 250 mL of D5W. Based on this order, the nurse should program the IV pump to deliver [dropdown1] mL/hr to initiate the infusion. After 30 minutes of the initial infusion, Mr. Johnson's blood pressure remains elevated at 160/95 mmHg. The physician then orders to increase the nitroglycerin drip by 5 mcg/min every 3-5 minutes until the systolic blood pressure reaches 120 mmHg, not to exceed a maximum dose of 200 mcg/min. Following this new order, the nurse should increase the infusion rate by [dropdown2] mL/hr. This adjustment will result in a NEW infusion rate of [dropdown3] mL/hr.",

        "correct": "The initial infusion rate is calculated as follows: (10 mcg/min * 60 min/hr) / (50000 mcg/250 mL) = 3 mL/hr. This calculation converts the desired dose (10 mcg/min) into the equivalent volume to administer per hour, given the concentration of the nitroglycerin solution. To increase the nitroglycerin drip by 5 mcg/min, the calculation is: (5 mcg/min * 60 min/hr) / (50000 mcg/250 mL) = 1.5 mL/hr. This determines the additional volume needed per hour to achieve the increased dose. The new infusion rate is the sum of the initial rate and the increase: 3 mL/hr + 1.5 mL/hr = 4.5 mL/hr. This is the final rate the nurse will set on the IV pump to deliver the adjusted dose of nitroglycerin. \n\nclinicalPearl: Always use a pump for nitroglycerin administration to ensure accurate dosing.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers may arise from errors in unit conversion, such as incorrectly converting between mcg and mg, or neglecting to convert minutes to hours. They can also result from misapplication of the formula, such as inverting the concentration or failing to account for it altogether. Another error would be increasing the drip by an incorrect amount or using the maximum dose instead of the ordered increment. These mistakes highlight the need for careful attention to detail and accurate calculations when administering high-alert medications.\n\nclinicalPearl: Double-check all calculations with another nurse, especially for high-alert medications.",
