        "questionTrap": "The primary trap in this question is managing multiple unit conversions within a single calculation. Candidates may forget to convert milligrams to micrograms, or fail to convert the final rate from mL/minute to mL/hour, leading to one of the plausible distractors.",
        "mnemonic": "Use the 'D/H x Q' formula for medication calculations. D = Desired dose (10 mcg/min), H = Have on hand concentration (50,000 mcg / 250 mL = 200 mcg/mL), Q = Quantity (1 mL). So, (10 mcg/min / 200 mcg/mL) * 1 mL = 0.05 mL/min. Then, remember to convert to hours: 0.05 * 60 = 3 mL/hr.",
