    "stem": "A 6-month-old infant is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot. Based on the provided data, select the most appropriate nursing interventions. The priority intervention is to manage hypercyanotic spells, also known as tet spells. During a tet spell, the nurse should first place the infant in a [cloze-1] position to increase systemic vascular resistance. Next, administer [cloze-2] via face mask to address the hypoxia. If these measures are ineffective, the nurse should prepare to administer [cloze-3] IV, which is a vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance and reduces right-to-left shunting.",

Mother reports a 'tet spell.' Labs: Hgb 18 g/dL, Hct 54%. At 06:30: RR 40, HR 140, SpO2 92% on room air. MAR: PRN morphine sulfate available. Recommendation: Titrate oxygen, prepare phenylephrine IV, notify cardiology physician. Keep patient calm, monitor vitals q15 minutes. Support/educate parents on tet spell recognition/management. Encourage knee-chest positioning at home.",

Administering oxygen addresses the hypoxia resulting from decreased pulmonary blood flow. Phenylephrine, a vasopressor, increases systemic vascular resistance, further decreasing right-to-left shunting and improving oxygenation. Morphine can also be used to calm the infant and decrease respiratory rate, which aids in breaking the hypercyanotic spell.\n\nclinicalPearl: The knee-chest position is a rapid and effective method to increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce cyanosis during a tet spell. It can be taught to parents for home management.",
        "incorrect": "Supine positioning does not increase systemic vascular resistance. While preparing for intubation might be considered later, it is not the immediate priority. Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat metabolic acidosis, which may occur, but is not the initial intervention. Digoxin increases cardiac contractility and is not indicated during a tet spell. Furosemide is a diuretic and would worsen the situation by decreasing preload. Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in ductal-dependent heart defects, not Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nclinicalPearl: Avoid interventions that decrease systemic vascular resistance or increase pulmonary vascular resistance during a tet spell.",
