A: Alert and oriented x3, in moderate respiratory distress. Initial SpO2 88% on room air. Bilateral crackles in lower lobes. Diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. R: Placed on 4L nasal cannula, initiated IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Due to worsening respiratory status and fatigue, client was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation at 10:00 for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Family notified of change in status."

A: Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 28 to 35 cm H2O. Scattered expiratory wheezes auscultated bilaterally. SpO2 has trended down from 94% to 89% over the last hour. Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was just checked and found to be 14 cm H2O. Client is tachycardic but hemodynamically stable. R: Concerned for bronchospasm contributing to high PIP and worsening hypoxemia. Low cuff pressure poses a significant aspiration risk.
