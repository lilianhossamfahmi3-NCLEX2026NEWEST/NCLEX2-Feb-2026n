    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD and hypertension, was admitted for pneumonia. Background: He was placed on mechanical ventilation at 10:00 AM due to acute respiratory failure. Current ventilator settings include FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 450mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. Assessment: At 2:30 PM, the patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is increasing, now at 35 cm H2O, and scattered wheezes are auscultated bilaterally. His SpO2 is trending downward, decreasing from 94% to 89%, despite the increased FiO2. The endotracheal tube cuff pressure is measured at 14 cm H2O. Recommendation: I am concerned about possible bronchospasm, mucus plugging, or worsening of the pneumonia. The patient's hypoxia is worsening, and the low cuff pressure increases the risk of aspiration. I recommend obtaining orders to administer a bronchodilator and to suction the patient if needed. Additionally, I need to adjust the ET tube cuff pressure to the appropriate range of 20-30 cm H2O. Please advise.",

    "correct": "Increasing PIP and wheezes indicate airway obstruction or bronchospasm. Administering a bronchodilator is the appropriate first step to open the airways. Low SpO2 despite increased FiO2 suggests ventilation/perfusion mismatch or alveolar collapse. Increasing PEEP can help to open alveoli and improve oxygenation. An ET tube cuff pressure of 14 cm H2O is too low. The recommended range is 20-30 cm H2O to prevent aspiration and maintain adequate ventilation. The cuff should be inflated to the appropriate pressure.",
    "incorrect": "With increasing PIP and wheezes, increasing the tidal volume could worsen barotrauma. Suctioning might be needed later, but a bronchodilator should be tried first. For declining SpO2, increasing FiO2 alone may not be sufficient if alveoli are collapsed. Decreasing PEEP could worsen oxygenation. For low cuff pressure, documenting is not enough; an intervention is needed. Deflating the cuff entirely risks aspiration and loss of airway.",
