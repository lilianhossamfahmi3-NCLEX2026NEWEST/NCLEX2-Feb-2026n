            "correct": "Increased PIP can indicate bronchospasm, increased secretions, or decreased lung compliance (e.g., pneumothorax). A sustained increase warrants immediate investigation. SpO2 below 90% is concerning, especially with high FiO2, indicating inadequate oxygenation. Purulent secretions suggest infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), requiring prompt treatment. Elevated WBC count supports this suspicion. ClinicalPearl: Always assess the patient first before adjusting ventilator settings based solely on alarms; consider the patient's clinical presentation. ClinicalPearl: Monitor trends in vital signs and ventilator parameters to identify subtle changes that may indicate developing problems and require intervention. ClinicalPearl: Elevated PIP can indicate issues with the patient (e.g., bronchospasm, secretions, pneumothorax) or the equipment (e.g., kinked tubing, obstruction). A systematic approach to troubleshooting is essential.",
            "incorrect": "Small PIP and SpO2 fluctuations are expected, but sustained increases and significant SpO2 drops are concerning. Clear secretions are usually normal. Normal PIP range depends on lung compliance and tidal volume, but a significant increase from baseline is a red flag. Stable SpO2 above 90% on high FiO2 may be acceptable, but not with sudden decline and respiratory distress. Clear secretions are expected; purulent secretions indicate potential infection. QuestionTrap: Focusing solely on one isolated finding (e.g., the increased PIP) without considering the other clinical data (e.g., SpO2, secretions, WBC count) can lead to an incomplete assessment and delayed intervention. HowToOvercome: Consider the entire clinical picture, including the patient's history, vital signs, ventilator parameters, physical assessment findings, and lab results, to prioritize the most critical interventions and determine the underlying cause of the patient's deterioration.",
