        "correct": "The patient's presentation (marked hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis with low bicarbonate and pH, ketonuria, and altered mental status) strongly suggests Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The primary nursing intervention is to initiate an insulin drip to gradually correct the hyperglycemia and associated acidosis, alongside aggressive fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring for hypokalemia is crucial, as insulin administration can exacerbate this condition by shifting potassium intracellularly. The expected outcome is a restoration of acid-base balance, reflected by an increase in bicarbonate and pH levels, and a gradual decrease in blood glucose.\n\nclinicalPearl: Always assess and correct hypokalemia before or concurrently with insulin administration in DKA to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.",

While fluid resuscitation is important for addressing dehydration, it is not the sole or initial priority in DKA management. Solely focusing on potassium replacement without addressing the underlying hyperglycemia will not resolve the root cause of DKA and may lead to further complications. Monitoring solely for hyperglycemia neglects the critical need to assess for and manage potential electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which can be precipitated by insulin therapy.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor blood glucose and electrolyte levels frequently (typically every 1-2 hours) during DKA management to guide treatment adjustments.",
