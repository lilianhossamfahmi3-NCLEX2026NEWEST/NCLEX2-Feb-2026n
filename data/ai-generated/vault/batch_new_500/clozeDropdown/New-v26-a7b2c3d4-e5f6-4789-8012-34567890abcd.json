The primary goal of treatment is to correct the life-threatening metabolic acidosis by administering insulin. Insulin stops the breakdown of fats for energy (ketogenesis), allowing cells to use glucose and resolving the acidosis. As insulin drives potassium into the cells along with glucose, the client is at high risk for developing severe hypokalemia, which can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Therefore, monitoring potassium levels is a critical safety priority.",
