Lives alone in a rural area with limited access to consistent follow-up care. Allergic to Penicillin.\nA: On admission, client is awake, alert, and oriented to person only. Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Skin is jaundiced. IV access established. Labs drawn and sent. Lactulose and thiamine initiated as per protocol.\nR: Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status. Administer medications as ordered. Provide comfort measures for abdominal pain.

He rates his abdominal pain as 7/10.\nB: The client has a known history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. His morning labs returned with a critically high ammonia level of 180 mcg/dL. He received a dose of lactulose at 08:30, but has not had a bowel movement yet. His adult child is at the bedside and is very concerned about the change in his father's behavior.\nA: Neurological assessment reveals disorientation, agitation, and positive asterixis ('liver flap'). Abdomen remains distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. Vital signs are stable but trending toward tachycardia. The current presentation is highly indicative of worsening Stage II hepatic encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonemia.\nR: Recommend continuing lactulose administration and considering adding rifaximin to decrease ammonia production. A dietary consult for protein restriction is crucial. Implement one-to-one observation for safety due to agitation and confusion. Continue frequent neurological checks."

        "correct": "The client's deteriorating mental status, asterixis, and critically high ammonia level (180 mcg/dL) confirm worsening hepatic encephalopathy. The priority is to reduce ammonia levels. Lactulose achieves this by acidifying the colon, which traps ammonia as ammonium and promotes its excretion via catharsis. Restricting dietary protein is essential to decrease the substrate (nitrogen) for ammonia production by gut bacteria. Frequent neurological assessments are critical to monitor for further decline, evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, and ensure client safety.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that do not directly and immediately address the root cause of hepatic encephalopathy—hyperammonemia—are incorrect. While managing secondary issues like ascites (Furosemide) or electrolyte imbalances (Potassium Chloride) is important, they are not the primary intervention for acute neurological decline. Increasing protein or sodium would be directly harmful. Administering sedating medications like morphine would dangerously mask or worsen the encephalopathy.",
