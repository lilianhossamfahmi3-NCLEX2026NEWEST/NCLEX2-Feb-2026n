        "correct": "Methergine is an uterotonic medication that stimulates uterine contractions, decreasing bleeding. Monitoring blood pressure is crucial as Methergine can elevate it, especially given the patient's history of gestational hypertension and current elevated BP. Assessing the fundus is essential to determine uterine tone and location, indicating if the uterus is contracting effectively. Encouraging breastfeeding releases oxytocin, a natural uterotonic, promoting uterine involution and reducing bleeding. \n\nclinicalPearl: Uterotonic medications like Methergine are crucial in managing postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. Methergine helps contract the uterus, reducing blood loss. However, it's contraindicated in patients with hypertension, necessitating close blood pressure monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "While other options might be components of postpartum care, they are not the highest priority in preventing further complications of postpartum hemorrhage in this specific scenario. For instance, while pain management is important, it is secondary to controlling the bleeding. Similarly, although assessing for edema is a standard postpartum assessment, it is not directly related to managing postpartum hemorrhage. Encouraging ambulation is important but also secondary to controlling bleeding and ensuring the patient's safety given her lightheadedness. Initiating a fluid bolus might be considered, but administering a uterotonic medication is the priority intervention based on the provider's order and the patient's assessment.\n\nquestionTrap: The question trap lies in getting distracted by the patient's gestational hypertension history and focusing solely on blood pressure management while overlooking the immediate risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Prioritize interventions directly addressing the primary problem, which is the postpartum hemorrhage, and then consider the patient's hypertension history in the context of medication administration and monitoring.",
