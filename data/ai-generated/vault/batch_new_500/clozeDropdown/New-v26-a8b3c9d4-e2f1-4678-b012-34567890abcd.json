Vitals: BP 150/95, HR 98, RR 20, Temp 37.2°C (99°F), SpO2 98% on room air. Reports lightheadedness. Labs show decreased H&H and thrombocytopenia. Recommendation: Continue to monitor vital signs and lochia closely. Administer Methergine 0.2mg IM PRN for boggy uterus as ordered. Encourage breastfeeding and monitor for any signs of worsening hemorrhage or hypertension. Provider is aware and en route.",

    "correct": "Methergine is an uterotonic medication that stimulates uterine contractions, decreasing bleeding. Monitoring blood pressure is crucial as Methergine can elevate it, especially given the patient's history of gestational hypertension and current elevated BP. Assessing the fundus is essential to determine uterine tone and location, indicating if the uterus is contracting effectively. Encouraging breastfeeding releases oxytocin, a natural uterotonic, promoting uterine involution and reducing bleeding.",
    "incorrect": "While other options might be components of postpartum care, they are not the highest priority in preventing further complications of postpartum hemorrhage in this specific scenario. For instance, while pain management is important, it is secondary to controlling the bleeding. Similarly, although assessing for edema is a standard postpartum assessment, it is not directly related to managing postpartum hemorrhage. Encouraging ambulation is important but also secondary to controlling bleeding and ensuring the patient's safety given her lightheadedness. Initiating a fluid bolus might be considered, but administering a uterotonic medication is the priority intervention based on the provider's order and the patient's assessment.",
