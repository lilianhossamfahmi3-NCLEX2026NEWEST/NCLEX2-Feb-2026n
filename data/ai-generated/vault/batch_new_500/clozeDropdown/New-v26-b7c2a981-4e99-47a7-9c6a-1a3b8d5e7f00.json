    "correct": "Continuous observation within arm's reach is the gold standard for preventing immediate self-harm in a patient expressing active suicidal ideation. This proximity allows for immediate intervention if the patient attempts to harm themselves. Prompt notification of the psychiatric team is crucial for timely evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment planning, including medication management and therapy. Documenting the patient's behavior every 15 minutes ensures close monitoring and provides a detailed record of changes in their mental state, which is vital for informing clinical decisions, adjusting interventions, and providing accurate information to the psychiatric team. This frequent documentation also helps to identify triggers and patterns in the patient's behavior.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying observation, distance observation, or infrequent documentation increases the risk of the patient harming themselves. Notifying the psychiatric team is a priority, not optional, as they are essential for developing an appropriate treatment plan. Longer intervals between documentation may miss critical changes in the patient's condition, hindering effective intervention. Focusing on comfort measures before safety is inappropriate when the patient is at high risk for suicide. Notifying the family before the psychiatric team could compromise the patient's confidentiality or delay necessary medical intervention. Documenting less frequently could miss critical changes in patient's behavior and delay needed intervention.",
