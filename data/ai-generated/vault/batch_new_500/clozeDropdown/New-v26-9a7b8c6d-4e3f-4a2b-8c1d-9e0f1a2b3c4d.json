Chlorhexidine oral care reduces oral bacteria, significantly lowering VAP risk by decreasing bacterial colonization. Oral care every 2 hours removes secretions and bacterial buildup, preventing pathogen proliferation. Daily extubation readiness assessment minimizes ventilation duration and VAP risk. Prolonged ventilation increases VAP likelihood.",
