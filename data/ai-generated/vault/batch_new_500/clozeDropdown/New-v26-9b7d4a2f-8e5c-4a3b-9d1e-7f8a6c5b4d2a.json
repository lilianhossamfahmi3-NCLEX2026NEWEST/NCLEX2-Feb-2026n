Mild jaundice noted on sclera and skin. Abdomen is distended, firm, and tender to palpation in the epigastric region. Oriented to person only. GCS 13 (E3, V4, M6). Vitals are stable.

Client is disoriented to time and place with pronounced asterixis (liver flap) present bilaterally. Vital signs are now concerning for Cushing's triad: BP 160/90 mmHg (MAP 113), HR 55 bpm, and RR 24 breaths/min with an irregular pattern. SpO₂ is 92% on 2L NC. R: High suspicion for acute cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to fulminant hepatic encephalopathy.

The priority is to reduce cerebral edema. Administering hypertonic saline creates an osmotic gradient, pulling fluid from the brain's interstitial space into the intravascular space. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees facilitates venous outflow from the brain, reducing intracranial volume. Spacing out nursing interventions is critical to prevent iatrogenic spikes in ICP caused by excessive stimulation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering hypotonic fluids would be catastrophic, as it would shift fluid into the brain cells, worsening cerebral edema. Lowering the head of bed flat (0 degrees) or too high (45 degrees) can impede venous drainage or arterial inflow, respectively, both negatively impacting ICP. Clustering care, while efficient, causes sustained periods of stimulation that can dangerously elevate ICP in a neurologically unstable client.",

                "explanation": "Incorrect. While lactulose is essential for treating the underlying hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia levels, it is not the priority intervention for managing an acute, life-threatening increase in ICP. Its effect is not rapid enough to address cerebral edema."

                "explanation": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees is the standard of care. This position promotes venous drainage from the head via the jugular veins without compromising cerebral perfusion pressure, thus helping to lower ICP."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "Incorrect. A flat position (0 degrees) eliminates the effect of gravity on venous return from the brain, which increases cerebral blood volume and raises ICP. This position is contraindicated in patients with suspected increased ICP."

                "explanation": "Incorrect. While it may seem that a higher elevation is better, raising the head of the bed to 45 degrees or higher can cause flexion of the neck or hips, which can obstruct venous outflow and paradoxically increase ICP. It may also decrease cerebral perfusion pressure."

The prolonged stimulation from performing multiple tasks at once can lead to significant and sustained elevations in intracranial pressure, risking cerebral herniation."
