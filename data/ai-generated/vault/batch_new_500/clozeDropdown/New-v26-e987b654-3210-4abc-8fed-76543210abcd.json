Based on the provided data, the most likely immediate cause of the patient's current AKI is [cloze-1]. The nurse should prioritize interventions aimed at addressing [cloze-2] to prevent further kidney damage. It is also crucial to monitor for signs and symptoms of [cloze-3], a potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalance common in this patient population.",

    "sbar": "Situation: Mr. Smith, a 72-year-old male with a history of CKD stage 3, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, was admitted yesterday at 2200 with suspected AKI. Background: He reports decreased urine output over the past 3 days. He complained of nausea at 0200. Assessment: Noted to have 200mL urine output at 0400. Became increasingly confused and weak at 0600. Current vitals: BP 160/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 37.9°C. Labs pending but initial creatinine was elevated at 3.5 mg/dL (baseline 1.8 mg/dL). Potassium is likely elevated. Recommendation: Orders include IV fluids, furosemide PRN, and cardiac monitoring. He's on metformin at home, held this morning. Alert MD of lab results, especially potassium. Concerns for hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. Maintain strict I/O. Implement droplet precautions due to potential respiratory infection, pending further assessment.",

    "correct": "The elevated creatinine, decreased urine output, and increased confusion suggest worsening AKI superimposed on existing CKD. The most likely immediate cause is hypovolemia secondary to decreased oral intake and potential over-diuresis (even though furosemide was PRN, it was likely administered). Addressing hypovolemia is critical to improve renal perfusion. Hyperkalemia is a significant concern, given the potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L, and can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answer choices fail to recognize the severity of the electrolyte imbalance (hyperkalemia), the potential for hypovolemia, or the impact of these factors on AKI progression. Some may focus on less immediate concerns or misinterpret the lab values.",
