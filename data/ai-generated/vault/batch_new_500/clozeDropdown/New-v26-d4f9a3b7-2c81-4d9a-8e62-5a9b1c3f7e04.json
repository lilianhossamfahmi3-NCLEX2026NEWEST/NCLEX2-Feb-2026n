        "sbar": "Situation: Sergeant Miller, a 28-year-old veteran, presented to the Emergency Department at 03:15, expressing, 'I can't take it anymore. I want to end it.' He is experiencing acute suicidal ideation. Background: Sergeant Miller served two tours in Afghanistan and was honorably discharged six months ago. Since returning, he reports significant difficulty adjusting to civilian life, characterized by persistent insomnia, recurring nightmares, and a marked increase in alcohol consumption. He has no known psychiatric history. Assessment: Upon arrival, Sergeant Miller appeared agitated, pacing restlessly, and exhibited a tearful affect, indicative of emotional distress. His vital signs were as follows: heart rate 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. He openly admits to having a concrete plan to end his life by overdosing on medication. He denies any previous suicide attempts but reports feelings of profound isolation, hopelessness, and a lack of purpose. Recommendation: An immediate psychiatric evaluation is urgently needed to assess Sergeant Miller's mental state and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Implementation of suicide precautions is crucial to ensure his safety. The attending physician was notified at 03:20, and Sergeant Miller's family was informed at 03:25 regarding his condition and current situation. Continuous observation is required to prevent any potential self-harm. The patient is currently located in room 302 under close supervision.",

Implementing constant observation ensures the patient's immediate safety by preventing any opportunity for self-harm or impulsive actions. Continuous vital sign monitoring is important to detect any physiological changes resulting from alcohol withdrawal, anxiety, or other underlying medical conditions, ensuring timely intervention and preventing potentially life-threatening complications.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to establish a therapeutic relationship hinders effective communication and information gathering, making it difficult to assess the patient's needs and provide appropriate support. Delaying suicide precautions puts the patient at immediate risk of self-harm, as they have already expressed a clear plan to end their life. Neglecting vital sign monitoring can lead to undetected physiological instability, potentially exacerbating the patient's condition and delaying necessary medical interventions. Focusing solely on medication administration without addressing the patient's immediate safety and emotional needs is insufficient in a crisis situation.",
