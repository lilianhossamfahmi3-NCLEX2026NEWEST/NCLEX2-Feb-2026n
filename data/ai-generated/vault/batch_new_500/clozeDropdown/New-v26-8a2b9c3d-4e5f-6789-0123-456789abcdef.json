        "correct": "Decreasing Oxygen Saturation: Administer a bronchodilator. The likely cause of decreasing oxygen saturation in the presence of wheezing is bronchospasm. A bronchodilator will help to open the airways and improve oxygenation.\nIncreased Respiratory Rate: Administer a bronchodilator. Increased respiratory rate often occurs due to increased airway resistance or difficulty breathing. Administering a bronchodilator will address the underlying bronchospasm and reduce the work of breathing.\nIncreased Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP): Administer a bronchodilator. Increased PIP suggests increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance. In this scenario, bronchospasm is the most likely cause, and a bronchodilator should be administered. If PIP remains elevated after bronchodilator administration, further investigation into other causes (e.g., mucus plugging) should be pursued.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing the FiO2 alone will not address the underlying bronchospasm and may not effectively improve oxygenation if the airways remain constricted. Suctioning might be considered if there's suspected mucus plugging, but wheezing suggests bronchospasm is the primary issue. Checking the ventilator circuit is important, but less immediate than addressing the bronchospasm. Manually ventilating is a rescue intervention and not the first step in this situation; addressing the bronchospasm is more appropriate initially.",
