Lives alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, which poses a barrier to accessing follow-up care. Allergic to Penicillin. Intubated in the ED due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.\nA: Alert and oriented x2, sedated on propofol. Placed on Assist-Control mechanical ventilation. Bilateral crackles in lower lobes on admission. SpO₂ 89% on 15L non-rebreather mask prior to intubation. Initial chest x-ray confirms right lower lobe infiltrate. Placed on contact and droplet precautions.\nR: Transfer to ICU for continued ventilatory support and management of severe pneumonia.

Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has trended up from 25 to 35 cm H₂O. Vital signs show increasing tachypnea and stable hemodynamics. The constellation of wheezing, increased PIP, and hypoxemia points towards acute bronchoconstriction.\nR: Immediate intervention is required to address airway resistance.

Wheezing is caused by the narrowing of the lower airways, which increases airway resistance. This resistance requires the ventilator to generate higher pressures (increased PIP) to deliver the set tidal volume. The narrowed airways also impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia (decreased SpO₂), and cause an increased work of breathing (tachypnea).",
