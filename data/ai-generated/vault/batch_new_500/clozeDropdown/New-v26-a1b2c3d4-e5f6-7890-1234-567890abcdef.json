Background: Patient's SpO2 has been fluctuating between 88-92% despite FiO2 of 60%. He is on Assist Control (AC) ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. He is receiving scheduled albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments q4h. Assessment: Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. He is alert but appears fatigued. Current pain level is 2/10. Recent ABG results are concerning. Recommendation: I recommend increasing his minute ventilation to address the elevated PaCO2 and improve his oxygenation. Consider adjusting ventilator settings and monitoring his response closely. We should also consider obtaining a sputum culture given his pneumonia diagnosis.",

    "correct": "The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2) and hypoxemia (low PaO2 and SpO2). The elevated PaCO2 of 65 mmHg is the most immediate concern. Increasing the minute ventilation (either by increasing the respiratory rate or tidal volume) is the priority intervention to blow off excess CO2 and improve the pH. Allowing the PaCO2 to remain elevated can lead to further acidemia, which can depress cardiac function and lead to dysrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Addressing the PaO2 is important, but correcting the respiratory acidosis (PaCO2) takes precedence. While increasing PEEP might improve oxygenation, it won't directly address the elevated CO2. Suctioning may be necessary, but the primary problem is inadequate ventilation, not necessarily excessive secretions. Changing to pressure support may not be beneficial in this case since the underlying problem is not the patient's ability to breathe, but inadequate ventilation.",
