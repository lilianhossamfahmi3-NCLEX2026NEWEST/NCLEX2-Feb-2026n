The absolute priority in managing DKA is to correct the severe fluid volume deficit with intravenous fluids. This action addresses the circulatory collapse, improves tissue perfusion, and enhances renal clearance of glucose and ketones. Following fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy is initiated. A critical complication to monitor during DKA treatment is cerebral edema, which can result from rapid shifts in osmolality as glucose levels are corrected.",

Other interventions are secondary or inappropriate at this stage; administering insulin without first giving fluids can worsen hypotension and cause a precipitous drop in potassium. Treating hypokalemia or administering bicarbonate before addressing the root cause (dehydration and lack of insulin) is incorrect. Other complications are less specific to the acute phase of DKA treatment.",
