    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 48-year-old male with a history of Type 2 Diabetes, was admitted three days ago for pneumonia and is now exhibiting altered mental status and rapid, deep breathing. Background: The patient has a history of non-compliance with his prescribed Metformin. Assessment: At 07:00, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli and displaying Kussmaul respirations with a noticeable fruity odor on his breath. His vital signs are BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 130 bpm, RR 36 breaths/min, Temp 38.9°C (102°F), and SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Pending lab results, but bedside glucose is 650 mg/dL. Nursing interventions initiated include a 1000mL NS bolus started at 07:15, followed by an order for a continuous insulin infusion at 07:30. Review of the electronic health record shows a history of poor glycemic control. His current medications include Insulin Lispro 5 units TID AC and Metformin 500mg BID, which he reports not taking regularly. Recommendation: Anticipate orders for electrolyte replacement based on pending lab results, with close monitoring of acid-base balance. An arterial blood gas (ABG) should be considered to evaluate for metabolic acidosis. Further assess for signs of infection and evaluate the effectiveness of the current antibiotic regimen for pneumonia. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status closely.",

    "correct": "The patient's presentation – hyperglycemia, altered mental status, Kussmaul respirations, and lab values indicating metabolic acidosis – strongly suggests Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Administering intravenous fluids is crucial to address dehydration caused by osmotic diuresis secondary to hyperglycemia. An insulin infusion is vital to correct the hyperglycemia and reverse the ketogenesis process by allowing glucose to enter the cells. Electrolyte monitoring and replacement, especially potassium, is essential because insulin administration shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially leading to hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) is less likely given the presence of metabolic acidosis. While fluid replacement is important in HHS, the primary intervention is still focused on reducing hyperglycemia, but typically occurs more gradually than in DKA. Thyroid storm is unlikely given the patient's history of diabetes and the absence of specific thyroid-related symptoms like goiter or exophthalmos. While antipyretics can reduce fever, they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Administering antiemetics might be helpful if nausea is present, but it doesn't address the life-threatening metabolic derangement. Administering supplemental oxygen may be necessary, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition.",
