    "sbar": "S: Jameson Tyrell, a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, HTN, and CAD, was admitted yesterday for a COPD exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation. O2 saturation has been decreasing despite increases in FiO2. \n\nB: Upon admission, the patient's initial ventilator settings were: FiO2 0.5, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Respiratory Rate 12 breaths/min, and Tidal Volume 450 mL. He initially responded well to these settings.\n\nA: At 07:00, the patient became increasingly agitated and restless. At 07:30, his respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min, heart rate is 110 bpm, blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, and SpO2 is 88% on the current ventilator settings. Recent ABG results (07:30) show: pH 7.28, PaCO2 65 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3 26 mEq/L. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is elevated at 40 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally.\n\nR: I am requesting orders for possible adjustments to the ventilator settings to address the patient's respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. I am also considering the potential need for sedation to improve patient comfort and ventilator synchrony. Could we also consider further investigation into the cause of the elevated PIP, such as a chest X-ray or further respiratory assessment?",

    "correct": "The patient's ABG results (pH 7.28, PaCO2 65) indicate respiratory acidosis, likely due to inadequate ventilation (hypoventilation). The elevated PIP (40 cm H2O) suggests increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance. Increasing the tidal volume or respiratory rate will help to blow off more CO2 and improve ventilation. Sedation can help to decrease oxygen consumption and allow the ventilator to better support the patient's respiratory needs. Reassessing ABGs is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of the ventilation adjustments and to ensure that the patient's respiratory status is improving.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to address the underlying cause of respiratory acidosis can lead to further deterioration. Simply increasing FiO2 without addressing ventilation will not correct the PaCO2 and may lead to oxygen toxicity. Administering a bronchodilator is important, but the immediate priority is to address the underlying hypercapnia with ventilation adjustments. Diuretics are not indicated without evidence of fluid overload; the primary problem is inadequate ventilation. Paralytics should be used with caution and only after sedation, as they can mask underlying issues and cause patient distress if the patient is conscious.",

      "Always correlate ABG results with the patient's clinical presentation and ventilator settings.",
