The immediate priority is fluid resuscitation using intravenous fluids to combat dehydration and improve renal perfusion. Addressing the dehydration will subsequently aid in improving renal perfusion and correcting electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring for cerebral edema is crucial, especially during rapid correction of hyperglycemia, as it can be a life-threatening complication, particularly in elderly patients.",

While treating the underlying pneumonia is important, it is secondary to addressing the immediate metabolic crisis posed by the DKA.",
