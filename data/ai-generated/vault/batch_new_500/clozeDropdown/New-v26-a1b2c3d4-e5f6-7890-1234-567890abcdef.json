Underwent surgical repair yesterday at 10:00. A: Currently, vital signs are stable: HR 140, RR 40, SpO2 96% on 30% FiO2 via nasal cannula. BP 70/40. Urine output 5 mL/kg/hr. Slight edema noted in extremities. Cries intermittently, consolable with pacifier. 06:00 Labs pending. 06:15: New order for Digoxin 8 mcg IV q12h. Noted slight increase in work of breathing and nasal flaring. Auscultation reveals mild crackles bilaterally. C: Continue monitoring vital signs, administer medications as ordered, assess incision site for infection, manage fluid balance, and monitor respiratory status closely. Report increased work of breathing or changes in lung sounds. Anticipate potential need for increased respiratory support or diuresis. Obtain a chest X-ray if respiratory distress worsens.",

    "correct": "Administering medications to increase contractility (like Digoxin) supports cardiac output post-VSD repair. Monitoring for decreased cardiac output allows for early intervention. Strict aseptic technique minimizes the risk of infection. Monitoring for elevated temperature and incision redness helps detect early signs of infection. Diuretics help manage fluid balance and prevent overload, reducing strain on the repaired heart.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to administer contractility medications or recognizing signs of decreased cardiac output can lead to hemodynamic instability. Neglecting aseptic technique or missing early signs of infection can result in serious complications. Ignoring fluid balance or failing to administer diuretics when indicated can cause fluid overload and heart failure.",
