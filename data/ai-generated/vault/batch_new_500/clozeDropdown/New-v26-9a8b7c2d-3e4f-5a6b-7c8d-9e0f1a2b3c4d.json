            "correct": "Decreased level of consciousness: Implement seizure precautions. Rationale: A decreased level of consciousness can indicate increased ICP and potential for seizures. Implementing seizure precautions ensures patient safety.\nSystolic blood pressure trending upwards with widening pulse pressure: Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Rationale: Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which can help reduce ICP.\nPupil asymmetry: Prepare for immediate CT scan of the head. Rationale: Pupil asymmetry is a sign of increased ICP and possible brain herniation. A CT scan is needed to determine the cause and guide further treatment.",
            "incorrect": "Decreased level of consciousness: Administer a bolus of normal saline. Rationale: Administering a bolus of normal saline could worsen cerebral edema and increase ICP. Question Trap: Nurses may think fluid bolus is appropriate for hypotension, but it is contraindicated in this situation.\nDecreased level of consciousness: Lower the head of the bed. Rationale: Lowering the head of the bed increases ICP by impeding venous drainage from the brain.\nSystolic blood pressure trending upwards with widening pulse pressure: Administer PRN Ondansetron. Rationale: While nausea can occur, addressing the blood pressure and ICP is the priority. Ondansetron does not address the underlying problem.\nSystolic blood pressure trending upwards with widening pulse pressure: Prepare for lumbar puncture. Rationale: Lumbar puncture is contraindicated with increased ICP due to the risk of brain herniation. Question Trap: Nurses may think lumbar puncture is appropriate for neurological changes, but it is contraindicated in this situation.\nPupil asymmetry: Reassess pupils in 1 hour. Rationale: Pupil asymmetry is a late sign of increased ICP and warrants immediate investigation. Delaying intervention can lead to permanent neurological damage.\nPupil asymmetry: Increase oxygen flow rate to 6L NC. Rationale: While oxygenation is important, it does not address the underlying cause of pupil asymmetry, which is likely increased ICP or brain herniation.",
