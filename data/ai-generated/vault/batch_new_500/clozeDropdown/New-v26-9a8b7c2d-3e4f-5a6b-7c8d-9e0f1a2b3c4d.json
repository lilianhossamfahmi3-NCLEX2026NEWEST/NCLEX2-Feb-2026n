    "sbar": "S: Jameson Tyrell is a 68-year-old male admitted three days ago for an acute ischemic stroke affecting the right middle cerebral artery. He's currently in the ICU.\nB: His past medical history includes hypertension, atrial fibrillation (managed with warfarin), and hyperlipidemia. His initial NIHSS score upon admission was 18, indicating a significant neurological deficit.\nA: At 0600 this morning, Mr. Tyrell's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 10 (E2, V3, M5), a decline from 14 at 0200. His right pupil is 5mm and sluggishly reactive, while his left pupil is 3mm and reactive. His blood pressure is 180/70 mmHg, heart rate is 88 bpm, respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and SpO2 is 97% on 2L nasal cannula. The neurosurgeon was notified of these changes at 0615.\nR: I am highly concerned about a potential increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) given the patient's declining GCS, pupil changes, and blood pressure trends. I am requesting orders for mannitol to help reduce ICP and a repeat CT scan of the head to assess for any worsening edema or hemorrhage. I also need guidance on optimal blood pressure management in the context of potential increased ICP, as well as clarification on the appropriate head of bed positioning. All relevant labs and vital signs are readily available in the electronic health record (EHR). Please advise.",
