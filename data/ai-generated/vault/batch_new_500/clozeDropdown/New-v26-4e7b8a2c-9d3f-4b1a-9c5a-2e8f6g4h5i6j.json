History of COPD and hypertension. Intubated at 10:00 today for worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. He lives alone in a rural area with limited access to primary care, which delayed his initial treatment.\nAssessment: At 13:30, the high-pressure alarm is sounding intermittently. Vital signs show a trend towards instability: HR 115, BP 155/92 (MAP 113), RR 22 (vent-set), SpO2 has dropped to 88% on FiO2 60%. Client appears agitated, attempting to sit up. Coarse crackles are auscultated bilaterally. ETT is secured at 22 cm at the lip.\nRecommendation: Immediately assess for airway obstruction or ETT displacement. Perform tracheal suctioning if indicated. Assess sedation and analgesia needs. Notify respiratory therapist for collaboration on ventilator adjustments.",
