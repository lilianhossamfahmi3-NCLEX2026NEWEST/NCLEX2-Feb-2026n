The nurse should consider [oxygenation] and notify the respiratory therapist for possible ventilator adjustments.\n\n**Scenario 3:** The patient is exhibiting signs of increased work of breathing, including nasal flaring and accessory muscle use.

ABG at 12:00: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55, PaO2 65, HCO3 24. At 13:00, noted agitation and rising peak airway pressure. Vitals at 13:15: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 22 (vent), SpO2 88%, Temp 38.5°C. Coarse crackles bilaterally. ETT secured at 22 cm. Recommendation: Assess for airway obstruction (secretions, kinks). Consider suctioning.
