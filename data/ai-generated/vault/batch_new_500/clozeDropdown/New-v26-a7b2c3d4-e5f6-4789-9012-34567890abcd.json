Last bowel movement was yesterday, noted as small and hard. Client lives alone in a third-floor apartment with no elevator, a stated source of anxiety.

Client is diaphoretic and flushed above the T6 dermatome. He appears anxious and is guarding his head.\nR: Suspect autonomic dysreflexia, likely triggered by fecal impaction. Immediate intervention is required. Plan is to elevate the head of the bed, assess for and relieve the impaction, and administer PRN nifedipine for severe hypertension.

        "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency. The correct sequence of interventions is critical. First, elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to induce orthostatic hypotension, which helps to lower blood pressure immediately. Second, the underlying cause must be found and removed. This is a noxious stimulus below the level of injury, most commonly bladder distention or fecal impaction. Finally, if hypertension persists, administer a prescribed rapid-acting antihypertensive like nifedipine to prevent complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "incorrect": "Lowering the head of the bed would worsen the hypertension and increase intracranial pressure, a dangerous action. Maintaining the position fails to use a simple, effective measure to reduce BP. While the stimulus is often painful, 'noxious' is the more precise term encompassing all potential triggers (e.g., pressure, temperature). Auditory stimuli do not cause AD. Anticholinergics and antiemetics do not address the life-threatening hypertension.",
