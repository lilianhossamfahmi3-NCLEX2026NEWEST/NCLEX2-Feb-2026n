Background: He reports a severe headache and blurred vision, classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia. Assessment: His blood pressure has spiked from 110/70 mmHg at 07:00 to 210/110 mmHg at 08:00. Heart rate is 52 bpm, indicating bradycardia. He is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of the injury, and reports feeling anxious. A small, hard bowel movement was noted yesterday. The patient is on a scheduled bowel management program. Catheter was placed at 06:00 and is draining clear yellow urine, initially ruling out acute bladder distension. Recommendation: I strongly suspect autonomic dysreflexia secondary to a possible bowel impaction. I request an immediate order for nifedipine 10mg PO PRN for SBP >180 mmHg to rapidly reduce his blood pressure and request an immediate physician evaluation. Further assessment for impaction is needed.",

Identifying and removing the noxious stimulus, such as a full bladder or bowel impaction, is crucial to resolving the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Antihypertensive medication, specifically nifedipine in this case, is indicated to lower the dangerously elevated blood pressure and prevent complications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and documentation of interventions and the client's response are essential for ongoing management and evaluation of treatment effectiveness.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rapid intervention is crucial to prevent severe complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction.",
        "incorrect": "Lowering the head of the bed would exacerbate the hypertension and increase the risk of complications. Ignoring the noxious stimulus will perpetuate the autonomic response and prevent resolution of the condition. Although other medications may be indicated depending on the underlying cause, an antihypertensive is the priority in this acute situation to prevent stroke or other complications from severe hypertension. Failing to monitor and document can lead to inadequate care, missed opportunities to adjust the treatment plan, and potential harm to the patient.\n\nclinicalPearl: Always prioritize addressing the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia while managing the acute symptoms.",
