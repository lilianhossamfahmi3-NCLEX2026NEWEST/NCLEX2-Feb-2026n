Background: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and underwent a total knee replacement surgery three weeks ago. He has been mostly sedentary since. Assessment: Patient reports leg pain as 8/10. Vital signs at 07:00 are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, and Temp 37.2°C. A lower extremity ultrasound confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left calf. Current home medications include lisinopril 20mg daily. Recommendation: The provider was notified at 07:15 regarding the patient's condition and has ordered a continuous heparin infusion at 18 units/kg/hour for DVT prophylaxis. STAT lab draws have been ordered. Please initiate the heparin infusion as prescribed. Ensure new orders for lab draws are completed, and titrate the heparin infusion per protocol once lab results are available.",

Next, calculate the total units of heparin to administer per hour by multiplying the weight in kg by the ordered dose: 100 kg * 18 units/kg/hour = 1800 units/hour. Finally, calculate the infusion rate in mL/hour using the available concentration. The concentration is 25,000 units in 250 mL, which simplifies to 100 units/mL. Divide the required units per hour by the concentration: 1800 units/hour / 100 units/mL = 18 mL/hour.",
