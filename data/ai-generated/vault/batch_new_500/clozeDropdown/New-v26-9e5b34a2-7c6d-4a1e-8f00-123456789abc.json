        "sbar": "Situation: This is John Smith, a 78-year-old male in room 302, admitted for a urinary tract infection (UTI), now showing signs of possible urosepsis. Background: Mr. Smith was admitted at 08:00 for a UTI. He has a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Assessment: At 14:00, the patient became increasingly confused and hypotensive. His current blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), and SpO2 is 92% on room air. Lab results include a WBC count of 15,000/mm³, lactate of 4.0 mmol/L, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, BUN of 30 mg/dL, platelets of 140,000/mm³, and procalcitonin of 3.5 ng/mL. Urine culture is pending. He reports increasing lower back pain. A Foley catheter was placed at 09:00. The patient is alert but disoriented. Recommendation: I am concerned that Mr. Smith is developing urosepsis and requires immediate intervention. I recommend drawing blood cultures immediately, followed by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically considering vancomycin given his MRSA history. We should closely monitor his vital signs and urine output. Contact precautions should be initiated immediately to prevent the spread of potential infection.",

        "correct": "The patient's presentation (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, confusion), elevated lactate, elevated WBC, elevated procalcitonin, and decreased platelets, coupled with his history of a UTI and MRSA, strongly suggest urosepsis. The priority intervention is initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures to combat the suspected bacterial infection and prevent further deterioration. Given the history of MRSA, vancomycin should be considered. Contact precautions are vital to prevent the spread of potential multi-drug resistant organisms like MRSA to other vulnerable patients. Hand hygiene is also essential.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the signs and symptoms of sepsis can lead to rapid deterioration and increased mortality. Delaying antibiotic administration or focusing solely on symptomatic treatment (e.g., antipyretics) without addressing the underlying infection is detrimental. Overlooking the patient's MRSA history and failing to implement appropriate infection control measures puts other patients at risk. Focusing solely on the UTI without considering systemic involvement is a critical error.",
