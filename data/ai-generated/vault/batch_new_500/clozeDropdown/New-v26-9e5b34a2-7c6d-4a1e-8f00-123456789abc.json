    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 78-year-old male in Room 302, admitted for a UTI, is showing signs of sepsis. Background: Admitted at 0800 for UTI. He has a history of MRSA. Assessment: At 1400, he became increasingly confused and hypotensive. BP is 88/52, HR 110, RR 24, Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C), SpO2 92% on room air. WBC 15,000, Lactate 4.0, Creatinine 2.1, BUN 30, Platelets 140,000, Procalcitonin 3.5. Urine culture is pending. Complaining of increasing lower back pain. Foley catheter placed at 0900. Alert but disoriented. Recommendation: I'm concerned he's developing urosepsis and needs immediate intervention. I recommend blood cultures be drawn immediately, followed by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically considering Vancomycin given his MRSA history. We should closely monitor his vital signs and urine output. Contact precautions should be initiated immediately to prevent the spread of potential infection.",

    "correct": "The patient's presentation (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, confusion), elevated lactate, elevated WBC, elevated procalcitonin, and decreased platelets, coupled with his history of a UTI and MRSA, strongly suggest urosepsis. The priority intervention is initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures to combat the suspected bacterial infection and prevent further deterioration. Given the history of MRSA, vancomycin should be considered. Contact precautions are vital to prevent the spread of potential multi-drug resistant organisms like MRSA to other vulnerable patients. Hand hygiene is also essential.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the signs and symptoms of sepsis can lead to rapid deterioration and increased mortality. Delaying antibiotic administration or focusing solely on symptomatic treatment (e.g., antipyretics) without addressing the underlying infection is detrimental. Overlooking the patient's MRSA history and failing to implement appropriate infection control measures puts other patients at risk. Focusing solely on the UTI without considering systemic involvement is a critical error.",
