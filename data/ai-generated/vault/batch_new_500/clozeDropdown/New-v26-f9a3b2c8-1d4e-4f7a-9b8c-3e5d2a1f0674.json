Her history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension, both managed with medications. At 07:30, her vital signs were: BP 160/92 mmHg, HR 110 bpm (irregular), RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and temperature 37.2°C. She's on telemetry. At 08:00, heparin infusion orders were received for the DVT. Eleanor reports left leg pain of 6/10, described as throbbing. She is alert and oriented x3. The heparin infusion should be initiated per protocol, with close monitoring for bleeding signs, including vital sign or mental status changes. Document baseline neurological and lower extremity assessments before starting the infusion. Ensure aPTT is drawn per protocol. Notify the physician for any concerns.",

Next, calculate the required heparin dose per hour: 18 units/kg/hour * 80 kg = 1440 units/hour. Finally, determine the infusion rate in mL/hour: (1440 units/hour) / (25000 units / 500 mL) = 28.8 mL/hour. Therefore, the correct answers are 80 kg, 1440 units/hour, and 28.8 mL/hour.
