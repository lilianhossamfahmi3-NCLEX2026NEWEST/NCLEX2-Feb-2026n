Client lives alone in a third-floor walk-up apartment, which may complicate discharge planning and follow-up. She reports her pain as a 6/10, described as a constant, deep ache. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Initial assessment reveals significant edema and erythema of the left lower leg.

High risk for pulmonary embolism. R: Initiate heparin infusion per protocol after completing baseline assessments. Educate client on bleeding precautions. Continue to monitor vital signs and assess for signs of PE, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, or pleuritic chest pain. Re-assess pain after infusion is initiated."
