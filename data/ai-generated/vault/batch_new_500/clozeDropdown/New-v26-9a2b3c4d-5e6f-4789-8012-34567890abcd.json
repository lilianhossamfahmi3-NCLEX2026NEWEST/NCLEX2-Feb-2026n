        "correct": "The correct sequence of interventions for autonomic dysreflexia follows a critical pathway to mitigate a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. The pathophysiology involves a noxious stimulus below the level of spinal cord injury (T6 or above) triggering an unopposed sympathetic reflex, causing severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. The first priority is to lower blood pressure non-pharmacologically by elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees, which uses gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension. Concurrently, removing constrictive items (clothing, binders) eliminates potential skin pressure stimuli. The definitive treatment is to find and eliminate the underlying cause (e.g., bladder distention, bowel impaction). Pharmacological intervention with a rapid-acting antihypertensive is reserved for when these measures fail to control the blood pressure.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can be fatal. Administering medication before attempting to remove the stimulus masks the problem and may not be necessary. Delaying the elevation of the head of the bed allows severe hypertension to persist, increasing the risk of stroke or seizure. Focusing on documentation or comfort measures before addressing the physiological crisis is a critical error in prioritization. While notifying the provider is important, it should not delay immediate, life-saving nursing actions.",
