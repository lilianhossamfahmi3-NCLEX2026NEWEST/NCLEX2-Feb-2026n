B: Mr. Reynolds has been stable since admission. This morning, he reported a sudden onset of severe headache and blurred vision. A: At 0700, assessment revealed a significantly elevated blood pressure of 210/110 mmHg and a decreased heart rate of 52 bpm. He also presents with a flushed face and diaphoresis above the level of his injury. He denies bladder distention but reports feeling constipated. The patient is alert and oriented but anxious due to the sudden onset of symptoms. O: STAT! The patient is suspected of experiencing autonomic dysreflexia, a potentially life-threatening condition. Immediate orders are requested for blood pressure management and further intervention to identify and address the underlying cause. Prepare to administer PRN hydralazine as per protocol. Physician notified at 0705 and verbal orders received and transcribed. Continuous blood pressure monitoring initiated.",

        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. The priority is to lower the blood pressure to prevent stroke or other complications. Elevated blood pressure should be addressed before other interventions. Raising the head of the bed to a sitting position helps to lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Identifying and removing the noxious stimulus is the next crucial step. Common causes include bladder distention, bowel impaction, or skin irritation. Medication should only be administered if non-pharmacological interventions are insufficient to control the blood pressure.",

Addressing the cause of the autonomic dysreflexia is important, but only after addressing the hypertension.
