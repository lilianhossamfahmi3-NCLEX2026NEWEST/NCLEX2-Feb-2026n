            "correct": "Elevated bilirubin leads to jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and sclera due to the liver's inability to process and excrete it properly. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by altered mental status, ranging from mild confusion to coma, caused by the buildup of ammonia in the bloodstream. Low albumin causes fluid shifts, resulting in edema, especially in the extremities and abdomen (ascites), as albumin is crucial for maintaining oncotic pressure. Prolonged PT/INR indicates impaired clotting factor synthesis, increasing bleeding risk because the liver is responsible for producing many clotting factors. Hyponatremia is commonly seen in liver failure due to fluid retention and dilution, often exacerbated by diuretic use. \n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor for asterixis (flapping tremor) as a key indicator of worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Assess for signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common and serious complication of ascites.",
            "incorrect": "Selecting incorrect options indicates a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of liver failure. Options related to hyperkalemia, improved coagulation, or decreased ascites are directly contradictory to the laboratory findings and clinical presentation. Assuming improved mental status or decreased jaundice is also incorrect, as these are not expected findings in worsening liver failure. \n\nquestionTrap: Students may be tempted to focus on isolated symptoms rather than connecting them to the underlying liver dysfunction. For example, they might choose 'decreased confusion' without considering the elevated ammonia levels. \n\nmnemonic: \"ALBumin problems in Liver failure: Ascites, Low oncotic pressure, Bleeding risk (due to decreased clotting factors).\"",
