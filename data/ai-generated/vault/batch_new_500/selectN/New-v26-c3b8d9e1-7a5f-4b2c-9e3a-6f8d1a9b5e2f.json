Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Her current Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 10 (E2V3M5). At 07:00, the patient is increasingly lethargic, exhibiting Kussmaul respirations, indicative of metabolic acidosis. At 07:15, new orders were received for a continuous insulin infusion and fluid resuscitation. Her current vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 36 and deep, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Urine output has been minimal since admission. Pending lab results are available. The patient's daughter reports that Ms. Olsen stopped taking her oral hypoglycemic medications 3 days ago due to nausea, potentially precipitating the DKA. The patient is placed on airborne isolation pending further investigation.",

    "correct": "Initiating intravenous fluid resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl is crucial to address the patient's dehydration and hypotension. DKA causes osmotic diuresis, leading to significant fluid loss, exacerbating hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances. Starting a continuous insulin infusion will help lower the blood glucose level and correct the metabolic acidosis, gradually shifting the body back to a normal metabolic state. The initial rate should be guided by hospital protocol and patient response, with frequent monitoring. Administering potassium chloride is essential to correct hypokalemia, a common complication of DKA and insulin therapy. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially worsening hypokalemia and leading to cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring the patient's neurological status is crucial to detect changes in level of consciousness and signs of cerebral edema, a rare but serious complication of DKA treatment, particularly in elderly patients. Frequent blood glucose monitoring (every 1-2 hours) is essential to adjust the insulin infusion rate and prevent hypoglycemia or rebound hyperglycemia.",
    "incorrect": "Administering sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended unless the pH is less than 6.9, as it can worsen hypokalemia and cerebral edema. The risks often outweigh the benefits in DKA management. While dextrose may be necessary later in treatment to prevent hypoglycemia as glucose levels decrease, it is contraindicated at this stage when the blood glucose is critically high. Increasing the oxygen flow rate may be needed if the SpO2 does not improve with initial interventions, but the current SpO2 of 92% on 2L NC is acceptable for now. The priority is addressing the underlying metabolic derangement. While assessing for ketones in the urine is helpful for monitoring response to treatment, it is not an immediate intervention to improve the patient's rapidly deteriorating condition.",
