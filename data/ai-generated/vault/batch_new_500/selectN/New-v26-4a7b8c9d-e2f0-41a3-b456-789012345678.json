R: Initial amylase was 1500 U/L, and lipase was 2000 U/L. Pain has been managed with IV hydromorphone. A: At 06:00, the patient reports increased pain (8/10) despite hydromorphone 2 mg IV given at 05:30. He is restless and diaphoretic with unstable vital signs. At 06:15, vitals are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, and SpO2 92% on 2L NC. His abdomen is distended, and bowel sounds are hypoactive. Input and output show significantly decreased urine output over the past eight hours. The patient appears confused and agitated. BGL is pending. P: I recommend immediate intervention to address his hypotension, hypoxemia, and pain. Consider increasing IV fluids, administering oxygen via a non-rebreather mask, notifying the physician for further orders regarding pain management, and evaluating for potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.",

A non-rebreather mask will deliver a higher concentration of oxygen, aiming for SpO2 > 95%. Increase the intravenous fluid rate: The patient's hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and elevated BUN/Creatinine with increased hematocrit suggest hypovolemia. Increasing the IV fluid rate will help restore intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion. Notify the physician immediately: The patient's deteriorating condition (increased pain, hypotension, hypoxemia, confusion) requires immediate medical intervention. The physician can assess the patient, order further diagnostic tests, and adjust the treatment plan. Reposition the patient to a semi-Fowler's position: This position promotes lung expansion and improves oxygenation, easing the work of breathing. Monitor urine output hourly: Decreased urine output is a sign of hypovolemia and impaired renal perfusion. Hourly monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and identify potential kidney injury.",

Further opioid administration may worsen respiratory depression and hypotension.
