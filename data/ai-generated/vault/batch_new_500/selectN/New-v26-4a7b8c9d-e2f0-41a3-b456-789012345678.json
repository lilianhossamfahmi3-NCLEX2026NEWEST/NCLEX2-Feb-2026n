R: Initial amylase was 1500 U/L, lipase 2000 U/L. Pain managed with IV hydromorphone. A: At 06:00, patient reports increased pain (8/10), despite hydromorphone 2mg IV given at 05:30. He's restless, diaphoretic, and vital signs are unstable. 06:15 Vitals: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Abdomen distended, bowel sounds hypoactive. I&O shows significantly decreased urine output over the past 8 hours. Patient appears confused and agitated. P: I recommend immediate intervention to address his hypotension, hypoxemia, and pain. Consider increasing IV fluids, administering oxygen via a non-rebreather mask, and notifying the physician for further orders regarding pain management and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.",

Increase the intravenous fluid rate: The patient's hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and elevated BUN/Creatinine with increased hematocrit suggest hypovolemia. Increasing the IV fluid rate will help restore intravascular volume. Notify the physician immediately: The patient's deteriorating condition (increased pain, hypotension, hypoxemia, confusion) requires immediate medical intervention. Reposition the patient to a semi-Fowler's position: This position promotes lung expansion and improves oxygenation. Monitor urine output hourly: Decreased urine output is a sign of hypovolemia and impaired renal perfusion. Hourly monitoring is crucial to assess fluid resuscitation.",
