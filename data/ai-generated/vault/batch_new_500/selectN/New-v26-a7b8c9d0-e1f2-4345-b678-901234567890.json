B: Patient has a history of autonomic dysreflexia, with the last episode occurring 3 months ago. At 07:00, vital signs were: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 20, and SpO2 98% on room air. The patient reports, “I have a pounding headache and feel flushed.” A: The patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Assessment findings include diaphoresis above the level of injury and patient reporting nasal congestion. At 07:15, the catheter bag contains 100 mL of dark amber urine. The last bowel movement was 3 days ago. Skin assessment reveals intact skin with no new breakdown. P: I am requesting orders for immediate intervention to address the autonomic dysreflexia and prevent potential complications. It is essential to assess for and address the underlying cause of the episode.",

    "correct": "Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees: Elevating the head of the bed promotes orthostatic hypotension, which can help lower blood pressure during an episode of autonomic dysreflexia. Assessing the bladder for distention or catheter obstruction: Bladder distention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia, so addressing this promptly is crucial. Checking the rectum for fecal impaction: Bowel impaction can also trigger autonomic dysreflexia. A digital rectal exam to check for impaction is necessary. Loosening any constrictive clothing: Constrictive clothing can exacerbate autonomic dysreflexia by increasing pressure and discomfort, so loosening it helps alleviate the trigger. Administering PRN Hydralazine 10mg IV per order: Hydralazine is an anti-hypertensive medication that will lower the blood pressure during this hypertensive crisis.",
    "incorrect": "Administering docusate sodium: While important for bowel management, this is not an immediate intervention for an acute episode of autonomic dysreflexia. Documenting the episode and notifying the provider after interventions: Documentation is important, but immediate interventions take priority. The provider should be notified concurrently or immediately after initial interventions. Applying oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min: The patient's SpO2 is 98% on room air, indicating adequate oxygenation. Oxygen administration is not a priority at this time unless the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.",
