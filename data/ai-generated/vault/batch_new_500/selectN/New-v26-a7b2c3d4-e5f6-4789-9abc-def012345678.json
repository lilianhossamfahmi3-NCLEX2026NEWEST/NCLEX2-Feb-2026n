        "correct": "Administer a rapid IV fluid bolus: The patient's low blood pressure (88/52 mmHg) and decreased urine output (20 mL/hr) indicate hypovolemia, a key component of septic shock. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to improve perfusion and combat the effects of vasodilation. ClinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as crackles in the lungs. Administer a vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine): Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure remains critically low. Vasopressors are needed to increase systemic vascular resistance and raise blood pressure to maintain adequate organ perfusion, especially in the context of septic shock. ClinicalPearl: Titrate vasopressors carefully to achieve the target MAP while monitoring for signs of ischemia. Initiate airborne precautions: The patient's productive cough with purulent sputum raises concerns about a potential airborne infection, such as drug-resistant pneumonia. Implementing airborne precautions is essential to prevent the spread of infection to healthcare personnel and other patients. ClinicalPearl: Ensure proper fit-testing and use of N95 respirators for healthcare personnel.",
        "incorrect": "Administer acetaminophen for fever: While the patient has a fever (38.9°C), addressing the underlying septic shock and improving perfusion takes priority over symptom management. Acetaminophen can be administered later if the fever persists after initial interventions to stabilize the patient. QuestionTrap: Students may be distracted by the fever, but addressing the shock is more critical. Increase the oxygen flow rate: The patient's SpO2 is 90% on 4L NC. While supplemental oxygen is important, the priority is to address the underlying cause of hypoxemia, which in this case is likely related to impaired perfusion and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Increasing oxygen flow alone will not resolve the shock or address potential respiratory complications. QuestionTrap: Students may focus on the SpO2 without considering the underlying cause. Prepare the patient for intubation: While the patient's respiratory rate is elevated (32 breaths/min) and ABGs are concerning (pH 7.30, PaCO2 50 mmHg, PaO2 70 mmHg), intubation should be considered if the patient's respiratory status worsens despite initial interventions. The priority is to address the hypotension and improve perfusion first, as this may improve respiratory function. QuestionTrap: Students may jump to intubation without considering less invasive interventions first.",
