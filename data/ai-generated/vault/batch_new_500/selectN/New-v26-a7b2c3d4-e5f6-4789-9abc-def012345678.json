Of note, the patient has a productive cough with thick, purulent sputum. B: Mr. Smith initially responded well to antibiotic therapy; however, over the past six hours, his condition has deteriorated significantly. He has a medical history significant for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A: At 0700, his vital signs are as follows: BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 32 breaths per minute, SpO2 90% on 4L via nasal cannula, and Temp 38.9°C (102°F). The patient is alert but confused. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. A central line was inserted yesterday. The patient is currently receiving maintenance IV fluids at a rate of 75 mL/hr. C: Immediately notify the physician regarding the patient's deteriorating condition. Increase the IV fluid administration rate as prescribed. Prepare for the potential administration of vasopressor medications. Continuously monitor vital signs and assess/document the patient's mental status. Obtain blood cultures and sputum cultures. Initiate airborne precautions due to the possibility of a resistant respiratory infection.",

    "correct": "Administer a rapid IV fluid bolus: The patient's low blood pressure and decreased urine output indicate hypovolemia, a key component of septic shock. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to improve perfusion and combat the effects of vasodilation. Administer a vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine): Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure remains critically low. Vasopressors are needed to increase systemic vascular resistance and raise blood pressure to maintain adequate organ perfusion, especially in the context of septic shock. Initiate airborne precautions: The patient's productive cough with purulent sputum raises concerns about a potential airborne infection, such as drug-resistant pneumonia. Implementing airborne precautions is essential to prevent the spread of infection to healthcare personnel and other patients.",
    "incorrect": "Administer acetaminophen for fever: While the patient has a fever, addressing the underlying septic shock and improving perfusion takes priority over symptom management. Acetaminophen can be administered later if the fever persists after initial interventions to stabilize the patient. Increase the oxygen flow rate: The patient's SpO2 is 90% on 4L NC. While supplemental oxygen is important, the priority is to address the underlying cause of hypoxemia, which in this case is likely related to impaired perfusion and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Increasing oxygen flow alone will not resolve the shock or address potential respiratory complications. Prepare the patient for intubation: While the patient's respiratory rate is elevated and ABGs are concerning, intubation should be considered if the patient's respiratory status worsens despite initial interventions. The priority is to address the hypotension and improve perfusion first, as this may improve respiratory function.",
