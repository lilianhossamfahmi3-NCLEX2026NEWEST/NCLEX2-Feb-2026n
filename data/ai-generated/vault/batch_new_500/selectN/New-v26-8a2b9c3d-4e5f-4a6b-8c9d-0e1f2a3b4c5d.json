Background: Admitted at 07:00 with BP 160/110, proteinuria 3+, and a headache. Magnesium sulfate was initiated per protocol. Assessment: At 12:00, her BP is 150/100, pulse is 88, respirations are 18, and SpO2 is 98% on room air. She reports a mild headache. The fundus is firm, at the umbilicus, with moderate lochia rubra. Deep tendon reflexes are +2. Urine output has been 60 mL in the last two hours. Magnesium sulfate is infusing at 2 grams/hour. She is breastfeeding. Recommendation: Continue monitoring BP and magnesium sulfate infusion per protocol. Assess for signs of magnesium toxicity, especially respiratory depression. Monitor urine output closely. Administer acetaminophen as needed for headache. Encourage breastfeeding. Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage.",

Administering acetaminophen for headache PRN is appropriate for managing discomfort; acetaminophen is preferred over NSAIDs due to the risk of increased blood pressure with NSAIDs. Continuing the magnesium sulfate infusion as prescribed is essential to prevent seizures, the primary medication for preventing eclamptic seizures in preeclamptic patients. Hourly assessment of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) is necessary to monitor for magnesium toxicity; decreased or absent DTRs are an early sign.",

Methylergonovine is contraindicated in preeclampsia due to its hypertensive effects, worsening the condition instead of treating postpartum hemorrhage. Restricting fluids is not indicated unless fluid overload is evident; it can decrease renal perfusion and worsen the client's condition. Discontinuing magnesium sulfate prematurely can lead to seizures; it is typically continued for 24 hours postpartum.",
