        "sbar": "S: Jameson Tyrell is a 68-year-old male admitted for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg. He is currently receiving a continuous heparin infusion. He denies any known drug allergies.\n\nA: Mr. Tyrell has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed with oral medications. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. He reports a pain level of 2 out of 10 in his left calf.\n\nB: Mr. Tyrell was admitted yesterday at 18:00 with complaints of left leg pain and swelling. A lower extremity ultrasound confirmed the presence of a DVT. He was started on a heparin infusion per hospital protocol shortly after admission. He reports that the pain has decreased since starting the heparin.\n\nR: Mr. Tyrell is receiving a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin 25,000 units in 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. The current order is to administer heparin at a rate of 1200 units per hour. His vital signs are stable: blood pressure 140/88 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 96% on room air. Recent laboratory results are available on the 'Labs' tab. The next heparin drip rate check is scheduled for 08:00. Please assess the IV site for patency and signs of infiltration. Monitor for any signs of bleeding, such as hematuria or melena, and report any concerns. Ensure PTT levels remain within the target therapeutic range of 60-80 seconds.",
