Assessing for visual disturbances is crucial as it is a sign of worsening preeclampsia, which can occur postpartum. Monitoring intake and output is vital to assess for fluid retention or decreased kidney perfusion, both potential complications of preeclampsia. Assessing for clonus and deep tendon reflexes helps to monitor for central nervous system irritability, a sign of worsening preeclampsia. Notifying the healthcare provider is crucial to discuss further management of the elevated blood pressure and headache, as these may indicate a need for adjustments in treatment.  Clinical Pearl: Postpartum hypertension can lead to severe complications such as stroke or eclampsia if not promptly managed.",

Methylergonovine is contraindicated in clients with hypertension due to its vasoconstrictive effects, which can further elevate blood pressure. Administering oxygen is not indicated unless the client's oxygen saturation is low or they are experiencing respiratory distress. While maintaining a semi-Fowler's position is generally recommended postpartum, it is not a primary intervention for managing hypertension. Clinical Pearl: Methylergonovine should be avoided in patients with elevated blood pressure due to its potential to cause further vasoconstriction.",
