Verifying the expiration date of the medication ensures its potency and safety; expired medications may be less effective or even harmful. Confirming the dosage with another nurse, especially for high-alert medications like cefazolin, is a crucial safety measure to prevent medication errors and potential harm to the patient. A second nurse can verify the dose is appropriate for the patient's weight and condition, reducing the risk of incorrect administration. Cefazolin is a high-alert medication that requires careful verification to prevent errors.",

In this case, addressing potential allergies and verifying dosages are more critical than adhering strictly to the 60-minute window. Assessing Mr. Johnson's pain level is important for overall patient care, but it is not the MOST important action prior to administering medications, particularly when considering the immediate risks associated with medication allergies and potential medication errors. The antibiotic is not directly related to pain management. Pain assessment is important, but not the priority.",
