He is currently on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. 14:30 - Patient complained of muscle weakness and nausea. Noted peaked T waves on telemetry. 14:45 - Notified the physician. New orders received, awaiting implementation. Current medications include: Lisinopril 20mg daily, Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily. Vital signs at 14:50: BP 160/90, HR 98, RR 24, SpO2 94%, Temp 37.2°C.

Administering regular insulin with D50W promotes the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid back into the cells, temporarily lowering serum potassium levels. Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating its excretion through the feces, thereby reducing serum potassium levels. Monitoring telemetry for changes allows for early detection and management of life-threatening dysrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Assessing the patient's muscle strength helps to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and identify potential complications of hyperkalemia.",
        "incorrect": "Administering furosemide may not be effective immediately in the setting of AKI with minimal urine output. While furosemide can help excrete potassium, its effectiveness is limited by the patient's impaired renal function. Lisinopril can worsen hyperkalemia by inhibiting aldosterone, which promotes potassium excretion; holding this medication is more appropriate in this situation. Increasing the oxygen flow rate is unnecessary as the patient's SpO2 is currently acceptable at 94%. Although the patient is hypertensive, the focus needs to be on the electrolyte imbalance first.",
