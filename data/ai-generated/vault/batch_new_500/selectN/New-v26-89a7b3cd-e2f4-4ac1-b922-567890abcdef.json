The goal is to improve oxygenation without causing further lung injury. Higher PEEP can help recruit more alveoli for gas exchange.",
        "incorrect": "Decreasing the FiO2 to 50% is inappropriate because the patient's PaO2 is already low at 65 mmHg. Decreasing FiO2 would further compromise oxygenation. The goal is to improve oxygenation, not reduce it. Increasing the tidal volume to 600 mL may cause barotrauma, especially with an already elevated PIP of 35 cm H2O. The focus should be on improving oxygenation and CO2 removal without causing lung injury. Monitor PIP closely if considering changes to tidal volume. Administering a bolus of normal saline is not directly indicated based on the provided data. While the patient's blood pressure is slightly low, it is likely related to the propofol. Addressing oxygenation and ventilation is the priority. Fluid boluses should be based on signs of hypovolemia, which are not present here. Initiating chest physiotherapy is appropriate for clearing secretions but should be done in conjunction with other interventions to address the underlying oxygenation and ventilation issues. Chest physiotherapy alone will not correct the ABG abnormalities.",
