        "correct": "Administering a bolus of intravenous fluids is crucial to address the hypovolemia indicated by the elevated BUN and creatinine, negative I/O balance, and increased heart rate. NPO status is essential to reduce pancreatic stimulation and allow the inflammation to subside. Administering analgesics, especially as the patient reports significant pain despite current medication, is a priority. Monitoring serum calcium levels is important, as hypocalcemia is a common complication of acute pancreatitis due to saponification. Initiating continuous pulse oximetry monitoring is necessary given the patient's increasing respiratory rate and decreasing SpO2, suggesting potential respiratory compromise.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a high-protein diet is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis, as it stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and exacerbates inflammation. Encouraging ambulation is not appropriate at this time due to the patient's pain and unstable condition. Applying heat to the abdomen is generally avoided as it can increase inflammation and discomfort. While proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole are often used, administering an extra dose is not indicated without a specific order, and the medication schedule is already in place. Administering oral pancreatic enzymes is not appropriate during the acute phase of pancreatitis, as the goal is to reduce pancreatic stimulation.",
