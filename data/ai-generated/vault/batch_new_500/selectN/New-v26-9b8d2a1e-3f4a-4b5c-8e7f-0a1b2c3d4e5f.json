He completed a course of oral cephalexin for a UTI two weeks ago. O/A: At 07:00, patient is febrile (38.9°C/102°F), hypotensive (BP 88/50 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122 bpm), and tachypneic (RR 28). Urine culture pending. WBC is 18,000/uL with 15% bands. Lactate is 4.0 mmol/L. The patient is currently receiving 0.9% normal saline at 200 mL/hr. Assessment indicates septic shock. R: I recommend escalating antibiotic therapy, obtaining a repeat lactate level in two hours, and considering vasopressor support if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation. The patient requires close monitoring of vital signs and urine output.",

Increasing the rate of normal saline without assessing the patient's volume status (e.g., central venous pressure, pulmonary edema) may lead to fluid overload, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Administering a dose of cephalexin is inappropriate because the patient just finished a course of it, and the UTI is likely resistant.",
