        "correct": "Maintaining continuous visual observation is crucial for patients at high risk for suicide because it allows for immediate intervention if the patient attempts self-harm. Removing potentially dangerous items from the patient's environment minimizes the risk of the patient using them for self-harm. Encouraging the patient to express their feelings can help identify triggers and coping mechanisms while building rapport and trust. Documenting the patient's mood, behavior, and statements provides a comprehensive record of the patient's mental state and helps to track changes over time. Consulting with the mental health team ensures a collaborative approach to the patient's care, bringing specialized expertise to the situation. Acetaminophen overdose can cause liver damage, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, which can exacerbate mental status changes and increase suicide risk. Continuous monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are essential.",
        "incorrect": "Allowing the patient unsupervised time can provide an opportunity for self-harm and should be avoided in high-risk patients. Focusing solely on the physical symptoms of the overdose neglects the patient's underlying mental health needs, which are paramount in this situation. Administering PRN medications without assessing the patient's current mental state and consulting with the provider is inappropriate. While family support is important, involving them before assessing the patient's wishes and safety can be detrimental and potentially escalate the situation. Ignoring the patient's feelings of hopelessness can exacerbate their suicidal ideation and erode trust. Acetaminophen overdose can lead to acute liver failure, impacting mental status and increasing the risk of impulsive behavior.",
