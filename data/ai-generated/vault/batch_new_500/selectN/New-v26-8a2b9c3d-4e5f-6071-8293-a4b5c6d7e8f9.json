        "correct": "The Normal Saline infusion rate of 250 mL/hr should be questioned. In HHS, initial fluid resuscitation is crucial, but overly rapid infusion can lead to cerebral edema, especially in elderly patients like Sarah Miller. A rate of 100-200 mL/hr is generally more appropriate after the initial bolus.  Rapid correction of hypernatremia can also lead to cerebral edema. The Regular insulin IV bolus of 10 units should also be questioned. HHS patients are often very sensitive to insulin; therefore, a lower dose (e.g. 0.05-0.1 units/kg) is safer to prevent rapid glucose decline and hypoglycemia. The Discharge planning consult should also be questioned at this acute stage. Stabilizing the patient and addressing the immediate life-threatening condition is the priority; discharge planning should occur only after significant improvement.",
        "incorrect": "The Potassium Chloride 20 mEq IVPB is appropriate because the patient's potassium level is low (3.1 mEq/L), and insulin administration can further decrease potassium levels. Monitoring potassium is essential, but administration is warranted. The Regular insulin infusion at 5 units/hr is generally appropriate *after* the initial bolus is addressed, but the initial bolus itself is the primary concern and should be questioned.",
