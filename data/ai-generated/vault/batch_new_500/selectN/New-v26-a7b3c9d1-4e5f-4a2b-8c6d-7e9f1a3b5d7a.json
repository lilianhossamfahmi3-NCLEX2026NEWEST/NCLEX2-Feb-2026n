        "correct": "Administering hypertonic saline addresses the increased ICP by drawing fluid from the interstitial space into the intravascular space, thereby reducing cerebral edema. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are crucial to manage the patient's declining respiratory status (RR 10, PaCO2 50 mmHg) and maintain adequate oxygenation. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps to reduce ICP. Continuous neurological assessment is essential to monitor for further deterioration and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Notifying the physician of the change in status ensures timely intervention and adjustments to the treatment plan. The patient's elevated blood pressure requires prompt management to prevent further neurological damage; antihypertensive medications such as labetalol or nicardipine are typically used.",
        "incorrect": "Administering Acetaminophen for pain/fever is not the priority in this situation. While fever can increase metabolic demands and potentially worsen neurological outcomes, addressing the increased ICP and respiratory compromise are more immediate concerns. Administering Ondansetron for nausea/vomiting is not the priority. While nausea and vomiting can increase ICP, directly addressing the increased ICP and respiratory compromise are more immediate. Increasing oxygen flow rate to 6L via nasal cannula will not be sufficient to correct the hypoxemia and hypercapnia indicated by the ABGs; intubation and mechanical ventilation are required. Administering scheduled Aspirin is contraindicated during an acute deterioration related to increased ICP and potential hemorrhagic conversion. It can increase the risk of bleeding.",
