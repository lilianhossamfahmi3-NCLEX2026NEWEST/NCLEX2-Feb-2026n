His last bowel movement was two days ago.\nB: He sustained the SCI in a motor vehicle accident six months ago. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril.\nA: At 08:00, his BP was 110/70 mmHg. At 12:00, it's 210/110 mmHg, HR is 52 bpm. He's diaphoretic above the level of injury and states he feels 'awful.' Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Bladder scan reveals 450 mL urine.\nR: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I request an immediate order for PRN nifedipine and further assessment to identify and alleviate the cause. Please address immediately.",
