        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to lower the blood pressure and reduces cerebral perfusion pressure. Assessing for bladder distention is crucial as urinary retention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Catheterizing the client as prescribed will relieve bladder pressure, removing the noxious stimuli. Loosening tight clothing reduces external stimuli that can exacerbate the condition. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes allows for close observation of the client's response to interventions and guides further treatment.",

While documenting findings is important, it is not an initial intervention during a hypertensive crisis. Addressing the physiological emergency takes precedence.",
