A: His BP is 210/110 mmHg, and heart rate is 52 bpm. He has nasal congestion. He reports having a full bladder sensation. He had a bowel movement this morning but it was small and hard. He is on a bowel management program. B: Admitted three weeks ago following a motor vehicle accident resulting in T6 spinal cord injury. He has been stable, participating in rehabilitation. He uses an intermittent catheterization program every 4 hours and stool softeners daily. P: I'm concerned about autonomic dysreflexia. I need an order to catheterize him immediately and check for bowel impaction. I will continue to monitor his blood pressure and heart rate every 5 minutes.",
