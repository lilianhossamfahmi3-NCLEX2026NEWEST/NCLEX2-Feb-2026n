Given his history of hypertension and current heart failure exacerbation, this requires provider notification and potential intervention.\nConfirm the warfarin dose with another nurse. Warfarin is a high-alert medication, and the INR is within the therapeutic range (2.8), but it is crucial to have another nurse verify the dose before administration to prevent errors.",
