Establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial for building trust and encouraging Sergeant Miller to share his feelings and cooperate with treatment. This helps in gathering more information and developing an effective care plan. Documenting the suicidal ideation and plan is essential for accurate record-keeping and communication among the healthcare team. This information informs the care plan and helps monitor the patient's progress.",
    "incorrect": "While administering lorazepam may be appropriate for anxiety, it is not the immediate priority. Addressing the immediate risk of suicide takes precedence. Contacting the psychiatrist for restraints is premature. Restraints should only be considered as a last resort when all other interventions have failed to ensure the patient's safety and the safety of others. Restraints require a specific order and continuous monitoring.",
