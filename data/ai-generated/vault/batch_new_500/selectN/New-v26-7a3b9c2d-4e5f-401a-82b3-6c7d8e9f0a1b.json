        "sbar": "S: Eleanor Vance is a 48-year-old female admitted at 03:00 for uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, presenting with symptoms indicative of a possible thyroid storm. B: Ms. Vance has a history of Graves' disease and reports poor adherence to her prescribed methimazole regimen. Upon arrival, she exhibited noticeable palpitations, tremors, and an altered mental state characterized by increasing agitation. A: At 07:00, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.5°F (39.7°C), a heart rate of 180 bpm, and a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Laboratory results reveal significantly elevated T3 and T4 levels, confirming hyperthyroidism. The patient's agitation and confusion are worsening. R: Given the patient's history, clinical presentation, and recent lab results, I am highly concerned about thyroid storm. I strongly recommend immediately initiating aggressive cooling measures to reduce her dangerously high temperature. Additionally, I advise administering beta-blockers to manage the severe tachycardia and hypertension. I have already placed the patient on continuous cardiac monitoring and recommend contacting the provider immediately for further orders, potentially including the administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. Continuous monitoring for dysrhythmias and changes in her level of consciousness is essential.",

Administering beta-blockers is also critical to manage the severe tachycardia and hypertension associated with thyroid storm. Administering acetaminophen is appropriate for fever reduction, but only *after* addressing the dangerously high heart rate and core temperature. These interventions stabilize the patient and prevent further complications.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of normal saline addresses potential dehydration, but is not the *immediate* priority in thyroid storm, where cardiovascular stability and temperature control take precedence. Administering levothyroxine is contraindicated in thyroid storm as it would exacerbate the hyperthyroidism, worsening the patient's condition. Waiting for further provider orders delays critical interventions. While provider notification is important, the nurse must act immediately on standing orders and implement life-saving measures based on the patient's condition.",
