A: At 07:00, her temperature is 103.5°F (39.7°C), heart rate 180 bpm, BP 180/90 mmHg. Labs show elevated T3 and T4. Agitation and confusion are worsening. The MAR shows Acetaminophen 650mg PO PRN last given at 06:30 and Metoprolol 5mg IV PRN not yet administered. R: I'm concerned about thyroid storm. I recommend immediate cooling measures, beta-blockers for tachycardia and hypertension, and contacting the provider for further orders, possibly PTU. Continuous cardiac monitoring and LOC assessment are essential.",

Administering beta-blockers is also critical to manage the severe tachycardia and hypertension associated with thyroid storm. Administering acetaminophen is appropriate for fever reduction, but only *after* addressing the dangerously high heart rate and core temperature. These interventions stabilize the patient and prevent further complications.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of normal saline addresses potential dehydration, but is not the *immediate* priority in thyroid storm, where cardiovascular stability and temperature control take precedence. Administering levothyroxine is contraindicated in thyroid storm as it would exacerbate the hyperthyroidism, worsening the patient's condition. Waiting for further provider orders delays critical interventions. While provider notification is important, the nurse must act immediately on standing orders and implement life-saving measures based on the patient's condition.",
