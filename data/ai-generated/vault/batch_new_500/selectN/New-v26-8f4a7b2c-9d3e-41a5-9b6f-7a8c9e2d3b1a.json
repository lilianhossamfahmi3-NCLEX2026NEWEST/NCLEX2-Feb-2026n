B: History includes COPD, hypertension, and recent influenza A infection. O: At 06:00, SpO2 is 88% on 6L nasal cannula. Respiratory rate is 32, labored. Heart rate is 110, blood pressure is 160/90. Coarse crackles are auscultated bilaterally. ABG results: pH 7.28, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 25 mEq/L. The patient is increasingly anxious and restless. A: Acute respiratory failure, likely ARDS secondary to pneumonia, with increased CO2 retention. There's a potential need for intubation if the condition worsens. Elevate the head of the bed. Notify respiratory therapy for evaluation. Closely monitor vital signs, especially respiratory status. Obtain a STAT chest x-ray. Consider a BiPAP trial. Assess level of consciousness frequently. Prepare for potential rapid sequence intubation. Ensure suction equipment is readily available. At 06:15, the patient is becoming more confused. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.",
