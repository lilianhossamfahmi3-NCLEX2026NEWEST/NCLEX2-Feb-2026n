O: At 06:00, his SpO2 is 88% on 6L nasal cannula. RR 32, labored. HR 110, BP 160/90. Coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 25 mEq/L. Patient is increasingly anxious and restless. A: Acute Respiratory Failure, likely ARDS secondary to pneumonia. Increased CO2 retention. Potential for intubation if condition worsens. Elevate head of bed. Notify respiratory therapy for evaluation. Monitor vital signs closely, especially respiratory status. Obtain STAT chest x-ray. Consider BiPAP trial. Assess level of consciousness frequently. Prepare for potential rapid sequence intubation. Ensure suction equipment is readily available. At 06:15, patient is becoming more confused. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.",
