A: Possible fluid deficit, worsening acidosis, and hypokalemia despite treatment. R: Requesting orders for increased IV fluid rate, potassium replacement, and possible bicarb administration. Needs close monitoring and further intervention. Last BM 3 days ago. 07:15: Called provider.",

Administering IV potassium chloride is essential to correct the hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and further complications. The insulin infusion rate should be carefully evaluated, but not necessarily decreased immediately, as hyperglycemia still needs to be addressed while cautiously correcting the acidosis and potassium levels.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the insulin infusion rate may lead to a rebound in glucose levels, exacerbating the HHS. Administering sodium bicarbonate is controversial and not a first-line treatment for HHS-related acidosis; it can worsen hypokalemia and cause cerebral edema. Administering a bolus of furosemide would further deplete fluids and electrolytes in a dehydrated patient, exacerbating the existing hypovolemia and hypokalemia. Contacting the provider is already done, further actions must be taken based on that communication.",
