        "correct": "Monitoring blood pressure closely is crucial in the postpartum period for clients with preeclampsia, as it can remain elevated or even worsen in the days following delivery. Elevated blood pressure can lead to serious complications such as stroke or seizures. Assessing for signs of postpartum hemorrhage is vital, as preeclampsia can increase the risk of uterine atony and bleeding due to impaired coagulation. Early detection and intervention can prevent significant blood loss and associated complications. Administering labetalol as prescribed for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 160 mmHg is important to prevent complications such as stroke or seizures. Labetalol helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of end-organ damage. Assessing lochia frequently is important to monitor for hemorrhage.",
        "incorrect": "While assessing reflexes is important, it is less critical than managing blood pressure and monitoring for postpartum hemorrhage, especially since the magnesium sulfate has been discontinued. Assessing for signs of magnesium toxicity is no longer indicated, as the magnesium sulfate infusion has been discontinued. Restricting fluids is generally not recommended unless there are signs of fluid overload; preeclamptic patients need adequate hydration to maintain adequate renal perfusion. While patient comfort is important, administering acetaminophen for headache is less critical than managing blood pressure and monitoring for postpartum hemorrhage. The priority is to address the underlying cause of the headache (elevated blood pressure) and prevent complications.",
