Currently on Assist-Control (AC) mode, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 14 breaths/min. B: History of COPD and hypertension. Baseline SpO2 was 88% on room air. Improved to 94% after intubation, but now trending down to 90%. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. A: At 07:00, ABG results: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O. Patient is restless and intermittently agitated. Last suctioning was at 06:00, moderate amount of thick, white secretions obtained. R: Please evaluate and provide orders to optimize ventilation and address the declining SpO2 and ABG abnormalities. Consider interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation, manage secretions, and ensure patient comfort. Notify if further deterioration occurs.",

    "correct": "Increasing the FiO2 is crucial to improve the patient's hypoxemia (PaO2 65 mmHg, SpO2 90%). Addressing the low PaO2 is paramount. Assessing and managing the patient's pain and agitation is important as agitation can increase oxygen demand and affect ventilation synchrony. The MAR shows Morphine is available PRN but being held due to respiratory rate; alternate pain management should be investigated. Increasing the PEEP can help improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and increasing the surface area for gas exchange. However, it must be done cautiously, monitoring for barotrauma and decreased cardiac output. Performing endotracheal suctioning is indicated given the coarse crackles and the report of thick secretions obtained during the last suctioning. Clearing the airway of secretions will improve ventilation and oxygenation.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the tidal volume would likely worsen the hypercapnia (PaCO2 55 mmHg). While lung protection is important, acutely lowering the tidal volume without addressing the underlying cause of hypercapnia is not the priority. Administering a bronchodilator would be appropriate if there were evidence of bronchospasm (e.g., wheezing). However, the auscultation findings and ABG suggest the primary issues are hypoxemia, hypercapnia and secretion management. Changing the ventilator mode to SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) may be considered later, but is not the immediate priority. The patient is currently on AC, which provides support for every breath. The immediate need is to address the hypoxemia and hypercapnia.",
