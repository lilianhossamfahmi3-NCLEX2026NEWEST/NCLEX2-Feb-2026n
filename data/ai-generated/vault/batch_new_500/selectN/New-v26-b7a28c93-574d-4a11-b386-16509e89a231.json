Current Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 11. B: History includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Stroke confirmed by CT scan on admission. Received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within three hours of symptom onset. A: At 07:00, GCS is 11 (E3, V3, M5). Right-sided weakness noted. Pupils are equal and reactive, but sluggish. Blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 24 and labored, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula. ICP monitoring reads 22 mmHg. Patient denies headache. R: Recommend immediate notification of provider regarding increased ICP. Continue hourly neurological assessments. Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage. Strict intake and output monitoring is crucial. Administer prescribed medications, including mannitol for ICP and labetalol for hypertension. Monitor for seizure activity and implement precautions. Consider further imaging or interventions per provider assessment.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering prescribed mannitol helps reduce ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Maintaining a neutral head position prevents jugular vein compression, facilitating venous drainage and reducing ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes indicating worsening ICP or complications.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a fluid bolus could worsen cerebral edema and increase ICP. Clustering nursing activities can increase ICP due to stimulation and increased metabolic demands. Encouraging coughing can transiently increase ICP, which is detrimental in this situation. Lowering the head of the bed would increase ICP by increasing cerebral blood volume.",
