Received tPA upon arrival. Currently on telemetry and continuous BP monitoring. A: At 06:00 this morning, the patient was noted to have a decreased level of consciousness. GCS score is now 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5) compared to 15 yesterday. Right-sided weakness persists. Pupils are now unequal, with the right pupil being dilated and sluggish to light. BP trending upwards: currently 180/100 mmHg. Heart rate is 55 bpm. RR 10 and shallow. O2 sat 92% on 2L NC. Physician notified at 06:15. R: Anticipate orders for a repeat CT scan of the head, possible mannitol administration, and further neurological assessment. Considering interventions to manage increased ICP. Will continue to monitor closely and document changes.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering prescribed hyperosmolar medications like mannitol draws fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, decreasing ICP. Maintaining a neutral head position prevents obstruction of venous outflow from the brain, which can exacerbate ICP. These actions directly address the Monroe-Kellie doctrine, which states that the total volume of brain, blood, and CSF must remain constant. Reducing any one of these components (in this case, brain tissue fluid) will reduce ICP.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of hypotonic IV fluids (e.g., 0.45% NaCl) can worsen cerebral edema by causing fluid to shift into the brain tissue, increasing ICP. Clustering nursing activities can increase ICP due to stimulation and stress, leading to increased metabolic demands and cerebral blood flow. Encouraging coughing can transiently increase intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain and elevate ICP. These actions can disrupt the delicate balance within the skull and exacerbate the patient's condition.",
