His blood pressure has been declining despite an initial fluid bolus. R: The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. He initially responded to a 1L crystalloid bolus but now exhibits worsening hypotension and reduced urine output. O: At 07:30, his blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 bpm, respiratory rate is 28, and SpO2 is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. He is lethargic but responsive to verbal stimuli. Urine output is 15 mL/hr. His temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C). Initial lactate was elevated at 4.0 mmol/L. Labs are pending. A: The patient is exhibiting signs of worsening septic shock. I: I recommend initiating vasopressors, obtaining blood cultures, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continuing fluid resuscitation while closely monitoring his hemodynamic status.",

        "correct": "Initiating vasopressors is crucial to increase the patient's blood pressure and maintain adequate tissue perfusion in the face of persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. Obtaining blood cultures is essential to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly is vital in treating sepsis and preventing further deterioration. Continuing fluid resuscitation is important to optimize preload and improve cardiac output, but it should be done cautiously while monitoring for fluid overload. Monitoring urine output closely is essential to assess renal perfusion and guide fluid management. These actions directly address the life-threatening consequences of septic shock.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker would be contraindicated as it will further decrease the heart rate and blood pressure, exacerbating the shock state. Beta-blockers are used to lower heart rate and blood pressure, which is the opposite of what is needed in septic shock. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can impair respiratory function and does not improve cardiac output or tissue perfusion. Elevating the legs might transiently increase venous return, but Trendelenburg can compromise breathing. Decreasing the oxygen flow rate is inappropriate, given the patient's oxygen saturation of 92% and increased respiratory rate, which indicate respiratory distress. The patient needs supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate saturation.",
