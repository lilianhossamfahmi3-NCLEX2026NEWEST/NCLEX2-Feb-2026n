He reports severe abdominal pain (8/10) radiating to his back, along with nausea and vomiting. His BP is 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and temp 38.5°C (101.3°F). The patient is NPO. Morphine 4mg IV was administered at 04:00 for pain, with minimal relief reported. Abdominal assessment reveals guarding and tenderness to palpation. Amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated. The patient is at risk for fluid volume deficit and electrolyte imbalances. Notify the provider if pain is uncontrolled or vital signs worsen. Anticipate orders for IV fluids and electrolyte replacement. Maintain strict NPO status. Monitor for complications such as ARDS. Assess respiratory effort and oxygen saturation frequently.",

IV fluids correct fluid volume deficit from vomiting, third spacing, and decreased intake. Monitoring electrolytes is crucial as pancreatitis can cause imbalances like hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Assessing pain and medication effectiveness ensures patient comfort and evaluates analgesic efficacy. Monitoring respiratory status is vital due to potential complications like ARDS or pleural effusion.",
        "incorrect": "Oral analgesics are contraindicated due to NPO status and potential for increased nausea/vomiting. Ambulation isn't a priority in the acute phase due to pain and instability. A high-fat diet exacerbates pancreatitis by stimulating pancreatic enzyme secretion. Enteral feedings are contraindicated in the acute phase as they further stimulate pancreatic secretions. Antidiarrheals aren't indicated as diarrhea isn't a primary symptom; constipation is more common due to decreased intake and opioid use.",
