Strict monitoring and management are crucial to prevent complications like DKA. Administer pain medication as prescribed: Pancreatitis causes severe abdominal pain due to inflammation and pancreatic enzyme release. Adequate pain relief reduces stress and promotes healing. Maintain NPO status: NPO status reduces pancreatic stimulation, minimizing enzyme secretion and allowing the pancreas to rest and heal. This prevents further inflammation and complications. Monitor serum potassium levels: Hypokalemia can occur due to vomiting, nasogastric suctioning, and fluid shifts. Low potassium impairs cellular function and can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Provide oxygen therapy as needed: Pancreatitis can cause respiratory distress due to inflammation, fluid accumulation, and potential ARDS. Oxygen therapy maintains adequate oxygenation to prevent hypoxia.",
