Temperature is 38.2°C, and his WBC is elevated at 14,500/µL. He is on continuous IV sedation with propofol. I’m concerned about the increased volume and purulence of his sputum, along with a new onset of coarse crackles in the lower lobes. I’ve already suctioned him, but the secretions are tenacious.

        "correct": "Implementing strategies to prevent VAP is crucial for mechanically ventilated patients. Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees minimizes the risk of aspiration by promoting gravitational drainage and reducing reflux. Performing frequent oral care with chlorhexidine reduces the bacterial load in the oral cavity, preventing colonization of the respiratory tract. Ensuring adequate endotracheal cuff pressure (20-30 cm H2O) prevents leakage of contaminated secretions around the endotracheal tube into the lower respiratory tract. Regular suctioning removes secretions that can harbor bacteria, preventing their accumulation and potential aspiration. Minimizing sedation helps facilitate weaning and reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation, a major risk factor for VAP. This is because lighter sedation allows for better cough and gag reflexes, which are protective against aspiration. ClinicalPearl: VAP is defined as pneumonia that develops more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering prophylactic antibiotics is generally discouraged due to the risk of promoting antibiotic resistance and the development of multi-drug resistant organisms. Routine changes of ventilator circuits are not recommended, as they have not been shown to reduce VAP rates and may increase the risk of contamination by introducing new pathogens. Maintaining a supine position increases the risk of aspiration and should be avoided; elevating the head of the bed is a key preventative measure. Limiting suctioning to only when absolutely necessary can lead to secretion build-up and increase the risk of VAP; regular suctioning is important to clear secretions. While proton pump inhibitors can prevent stress ulcers, they can also alter the gastric pH, potentially increasing the risk of bacterial overgrowth and subsequent respiratory infections. QuestionTrap: Be careful not to select interventions that are generally good nursing practice but do not directly address VAP prevention. For example, monitoring vital signs is important, but it doesn't directly prevent VAP.",
