BACKGROUND: Samuel has intermittent cyanosis triggered by crying or feeding. He receives 1 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. ASSESSMENT: At 10:30, SpO2 dropped to 70%, with increased respiratory effort and agitation. Heart rate is 180 bpm. Circumoral and nail bed cyanosis are present. Mother reports inconsolable crying for 10 minutes. Labs show Hgb 18 g/dL, Hct 54%, PaO2 55 mmHg, PaCO2 38 mmHg, pH 7.32. Vitals at 10:30: HR 180, RR 48, SpO2 70%, BP 80/50, Temp 37.2°C. MAR shows morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV PRN, propranolol 0.25 mg/kg PO Q6H (last dose 06:00), and continuous oxygen. RECOMMENDATION: Immediate interventions for hypercyanotic spell are needed: knee-chest positioning, increasing oxygen, and considering morphine per protocol. Requesting immediate assessment and further orders.",

        "correct": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing right-to-left shunting and improving pulmonary blood flow, thus increasing oxygen saturation. Administering 100% oxygen via face mask maximizes oxygen uptake into the bloodstream to combat desaturation. Morphine sulfate IV reduces pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, breaking the hypercyanotic spell cycle and calming the infant, reducing oxygen demand. An IV bolus of normal saline increases preload and improves cardiac output, potentially improving oxygen delivery. Tet spells can cause relative hypovolemia due to systemic vasodilation. Clinical Pearl: Knee-chest position is a cornerstone of initial management.",
        "incorrect": "Restricting fluids worsens hypovolemia and decreases cardiac output. Assessing lung sounds is not the priority during an acute hypercyanotic spell; focus is on improving oxygenation and reducing the shunt. Obtaining a blood gas sample delays immediate interventions. Waiting for the provider delays critical interventions; the nurse should initiate interventions immediately per established protocols. Propranolol is for long-term management, not acute hypercyanotic spells. Question Trap: Nurses may focus solely on oxygen administration and overlook the importance of positioning and medication. How to overcome: Recognize the need for a multi-faceted approach.",
