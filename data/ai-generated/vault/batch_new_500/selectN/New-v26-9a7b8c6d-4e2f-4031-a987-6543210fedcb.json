Labs show TSH <0.01 mIU/L, Free T4 6.2 ng/dL, Free T3 28 pg/mL. A: Physician notified at 03:15, verbal orders received: IV fluids, cooling blanket, propranolol 1mg IV push q5 min until HR < 120, then q4h; propylthiouracil (PTU) 200mg PO q6h; continuous EKG monitoring; assess level of consciousness hourly; airborne precautions initiated. B: Patient is increasingly agitated; respiratory status is concerning. Continue close monitoring of vital signs and administer medications as ordered. Prepare for potential intubation if respiratory status declines. Consider transfer to higher level of care if no improvement.",
