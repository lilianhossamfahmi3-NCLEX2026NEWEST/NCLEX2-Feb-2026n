CABG was performed yesterday due to significant blockage. The initial post-operative period was stable.\nA: At 07:00, the patient's BP is 80/50 mmHg, HR is 120 bpm, RR is 32 and labored, and SpO2 is 88% on 6L NC. CVP is 18 mmHg, and UO is 15 mL/hr. The patient appears pale, cool, and clammy. New onset bilateral crackles are auscultated. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with occasional PVCs. The patient reports chest pain (4/10).\nR: Anticipate orders for inotropic support and afterload reduction. Further evaluation for potential complications such as cardiac tamponade or pump failure is needed. STAT ABG and echocardiogram have been ordered. Continue close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status. Notify the attending physician of any changes.",

        "correct": "Initiating dobutamine is crucial as it is an inotrope that increases myocardial contractility, improving cardiac output and blood pressure. Administering supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask addresses the hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) more effectively than a nasal cannula. Reducing preload with a diuretic like furosemide is beneficial to alleviate pulmonary congestion. Nitroglycerin can be used to reduce afterload, thereby decreasing the workload on the heart. Monitoring hourly urine output helps assess renal perfusion and the effectiveness of interventions. Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock as it increases preload and cardiac workload, potentially worsening pulmonary edema. \n\nclinicalPearl: Dobutamine increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output, while nitroglycerin reduces afterload, easing the heart's workload. Furosemide reduces preload by diuresis, alleviating pulmonary congestion.",
        "incorrect": "Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock; it worsens pulmonary edema. While morphine can alleviate chest pain, it can also cause hypotension and respiratory depression, which are detrimental in this situation. A fluid bolus is generally contraindicated in cardiogenic shock unless severe hypovolemia is present, as it can exacerbate pulmonary edema and further compromise cardiac function. While oxygen is needed, 2L via nasal cannula is insufficient given the patient's SpO2 of 88% and labored breathing. Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor that would increase afterload, further burdening the already failing heart. \n\nclinicalPearl: Avoid interventions that increase cardiac workload or preload in cardiogenic shock, as they can worsen the patient's condition.",
