History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous MI (2 years ago).\n\nB: Patient has a known ejection fraction of 30%. Home medications include lisinopril 20mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID, and atorvastatin 40mg daily. He missed his medications for the past 3 days due to a family emergency.\n\nA: Patient is in severe respiratory distress. Vitals at 14:00: BP 170/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 32 breaths/min, SpO2 88% on room air. Crackles auscultated bilaterally. Labs show elevated BNP and troponin. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with ST-segment depression in V1-V4.\n\nR: I recommend immediate interventions to reduce preload and afterload, improve oxygenation, and prevent further cardiac damage. Consider IV furosemide, nitrates, and NIPPV. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.",

The patient’s SpO2 of 88% on room air and high respiratory rate indicate significant respiratory distress requiring ventilatory support to improve gas exchange.\nElevate the head of the bed to promote venous return and reduce pulmonary congestion.

The patient's elevated troponin and ST-segment depression suggest potential ongoing myocardial ischemia, necessitating close cardiac monitoring for early detection of complications.\n\nClinical Pearl: Early intervention with diuretics and ventilatory support can significantly improve outcomes in ADHF by addressing the underlying pathophysiology of fluid overload and respiratory compromise.",
