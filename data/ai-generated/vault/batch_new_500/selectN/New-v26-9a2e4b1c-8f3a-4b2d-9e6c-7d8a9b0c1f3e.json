Breastfeeding well. B/P trending up. \nB: History of preeclampsia in previous pregnancy, managed with oral antihypertensives. Discontinued postpartum. No other significant medical history.\nA: At 12:00, patient reports feeling lightheaded and anxious. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air. Moderate lochia rubra with small clots. Fundus boggy at 2 cm above the umbilicus, displaced to the right. Bladder palpable. Patient reports pain 3/10.\nR: I am concerned about the possibility of postpartum hemorrhage and worsening preeclampsia. I recommend a stat CBC, magnesium sulfate level, and possible antihypertensive medication. Please assess the patient.",

    "correct": "Initiating fundal massage is crucial to contract the uterus and control bleeding. A boggy fundus indicates uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Administering Labetalol is indicated for blood pressure control. The patient's blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg warrants immediate intervention to prevent complications associated with severe hypertension. Inserting a Foley catheter is essential to empty the bladder, which can displace the uterus and hinder its ability to contract. A distended bladder can exacerbate uterine atony and increase the risk of hemorrhage. Notifying the healthcare provider of the patient's condition is paramount to ensure timely medical intervention. The elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and low hemoglobin/hematocrit require prompt evaluation and management by the healthcare provider. Monitoring oxygen saturation continuously is important to assess for adequate tissue perfusion, especially given the blood loss and potential for hypovolemia. Oxygen saturation below 95% may indicate impaired oxygen delivery.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging ambulation at this time is contraindicated due to the patient's lightheadedness, potential hypovolemia from blood loss, and elevated blood pressure. Ambulation could increase the risk of falls. Encouraging breastfeeding is beneficial, but it is not the priority intervention at this time. Addressing the hemorrhage and blood pressure are more critical. Administering Rho(D) Immune Globulin is not indicated based on the current data. This medication is administered to Rh-negative mothers with Rh-positive babies to prevent Rh sensitization.",
