Monitoring urine output hourly assesses renal perfusion and response to treatment. Drawing repeat blood cultures after antibiotic administration assesses treatment efficacy. Maintaining strict contact and airborne precautions prevents MRSA spread. Monitoring vancomycin trough levels ensures therapeutic drug levels and prevents toxicity. \n\nclinicalPearl: Early vasopressor use is key in septic shock to support blood pressure and organ perfusion. Norepinephrine is often the first-line vasopressor.",

Discontinuing antibiotics due to persistent fever is contraindicated; complete the antibiotic course. Initiating a blood transfusion solely based on a low platelet count (100,000) without active bleeding is not indicated. Providing a high-carbohydrate meal is inappropriate given the patient's unstable condition and aspiration risk; the patient requires nutritional support via alternative routes.\n\nclinicalPearl: Remember the sepsis bundle: measure lactate, obtain blood cultures before antibiotics, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, begin rapid administration of 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥4 mmol/L, and apply vasopressors if hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP ≥65 mm Hg.",
