        "correct": "Administering a beta-blocker (e.g., Propranolol) is crucial to block the effects of excessive thyroid hormone on the heart, reducing heart rate and blood pressure. Administering IV fluids (0.9% NS) is essential to address dehydration resulting from HHS and to improve tissue perfusion. Initiating an insulin drip as per protocol addresses the hyperglycemia in HHS by facilitating glucose uptake into cells. Administering potassium chloride is essential due to the hypokalemia evidenced by the lab results, which can be exacerbated by insulin administration. Applying cooling blankets or ice packs is important to manage hyperthermia associated with thyroid storm.",
        "incorrect": "Administering dextrose is contraindicated as the patient is already hyperglycemic. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate due to the patient's altered mental status, increasing the risk of aspiration. Administering a thiazide diuretic is contraindicated due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances associated with HHS. Monitoring urine output every 4 hours is insufficient; hourly monitoring is needed to assess fluid resuscitation effectiveness. Administering oral antidiabetic medications is inappropriate in the acute setting of HHS; IV insulin is required.",
