    "sbar": "S: Mr. John Smith, a 72-year-old male admitted two days ago for a right-hemispheric stroke, is now showing signs of increased ICP. His neurological status is declining rapidly, requiring immediate attention.\nB: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He was admitted with left-sided weakness and facial droop, indicative of the stroke. His initial NIHSS score was 14. A CT scan confirmed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.\nA: Over the past few hours, neuro checks every hour reveal a declining level of consciousness; his pupils are now sluggishly reactive. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score has dropped to 10. His blood pressure is trending upwards, currently at 180/100 mmHg, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 12, and SpO2 of 95% on 2L NC. He experienced new-onset vomiting at 16:30. His temperature is 37.9°C. We have also noted some restlessness and irritability.\nR: I am highly concerned about the increasing intracranial pressure and the potential for further neurological deterioration. I strongly recommend a stat neuro consult to evaluate the need for more aggressive interventions. We need orders for mannitol to reduce cerebral edema and a possible transfer to the ICU for closer monitoring and management. I will continue to closely monitor his neurological status, manage his blood pressure according to the stroke protocol, and implement measures to reduce ICP.",

    "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering prescribed mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, helps to decrease ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular system. Maintaining a neutral head position prevents jugular vein compression, facilitating venous outflow from the brain. Avoiding clustering nursing activities reduces stimulation that can increase ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes indicating worsening ICP.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of NS could exacerbate cerebral edema and increase ICP. Encouraging coughing can increase intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain and elevate ICP. Suctioning should be performed only when necessary, as it can stimulate coughing and increase ICP. Routine oral care is important, but aggressive oral suctioning can increase ICP.",
