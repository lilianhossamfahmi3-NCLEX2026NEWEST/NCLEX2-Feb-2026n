Neurological status declining rapidly, requiring immediate attention.\nB: History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Admitted with left-sided weakness and facial droop, indicative of stroke. Initial NIHSS score was 14. CT scan confirmed right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.\nA: Over past few hours, neuro checks every hour reveal declining level of consciousness; pupils are now sluggishly reactive. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score dropped to 10. Blood pressure trending upwards, currently at 180/100 mmHg, with heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 12, and SpO2 of 95% on 2L NC. Experienced new-onset vomiting at 16:30. Temperature is 37.9°C. Noted restlessness and irritability.\nR: Highly concerned about increasing intracranial pressure and potential for further neurological deterioration. Strongly recommend a stat neuro consult to evaluate need for more aggressive interventions. Need orders for mannitol to reduce cerebral edema and possible transfer to ICU for closer monitoring and management. Will continue to closely monitor neurological status, manage blood pressure according to stroke protocol, and implement measures to reduce ICP.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering prescribed mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, helps to decrease ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular system. Maintaining a neutral head position prevents jugular vein compression, facilitating venous outflow from the brain. Avoiding clustering nursing activities reduces stimulation that can increase ICP. Monitoring neurological status frequently allows for early detection of changes indicating worsening ICP. Limiting fluid intake helps to manage cerebral edema and reduce ICP.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of NS could exacerbate cerebral edema and increase ICP. Encouraging coughing can increase intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain and elevate ICP. Suctioning should be performed only when necessary, as it can stimulate coughing and increase ICP. Routine oral care is important, but aggressive oral suctioning can increase ICP.",
