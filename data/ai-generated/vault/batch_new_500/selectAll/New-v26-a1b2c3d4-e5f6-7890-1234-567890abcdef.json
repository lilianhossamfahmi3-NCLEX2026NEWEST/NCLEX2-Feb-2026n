B: Patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a prior MI three years ago. He presented with severe dyspnea and orthopnea. A: Currently, his vital signs are: BP 170/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 88% on 2L nasal cannula. He's restless and coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Labs show elevated BNP (1500 pg/mL) and troponin (0.8 ng/mL). EKG shows sinus tachycardia with ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. He received furosemide 40mg IV push at 07:00 with minimal urine output. R: I'm concerned about his worsening respiratory status and persistent hypertension. I recommend increasing oxygen to a non-rebreather mask, considering a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trial, and further evaluation for afterload reduction strategies. I will continue to monitor his vital signs and urine output closely.",

    "correct": "Initiating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing by providing positive pressure to keep alveoli open. Administering morphine sulfate can help reduce anxiety, decrease preload, and improve breathing in patients with acute heart failure, but requires careful monitoring for respiratory depression and hypotension. Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and reduces venous return, decreasing preload. Preparing for the administration of IV nitroglycerin can help reduce afterload and improve cardiac output by dilating blood vessels. Monitoring hourly urine output is essential to assess the effectiveness of diuretic therapy and fluid status.",
