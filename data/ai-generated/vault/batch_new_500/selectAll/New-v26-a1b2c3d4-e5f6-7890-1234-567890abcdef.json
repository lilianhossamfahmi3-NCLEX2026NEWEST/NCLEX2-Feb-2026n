Fundus firm, 1 cm below umbilicus, midline. Moderate lochia rubra with small clots noted. Patient reports headache and blurred vision. Background: Admitted with mild preeclampsia at 38 weeks gestation. Received magnesium sulfate during labor, discontinued 1 hour postpartum. Current orders include monitoring BP q2h, assessing lochia q1h, and administering PRN hydralazine for SBP >160 mmHg. Assessment: Increased BP, headache, and visual disturbances suggest potential worsening of preeclampsia postpartum. Recommendation: Please evaluate patient for possible postpartum preeclampsia and consider further interventions to manage hypertension. Monitor closely for signs of postpartum hemorrhage given lochia amount. Alerted provider at 14:15. New orders pending.",
