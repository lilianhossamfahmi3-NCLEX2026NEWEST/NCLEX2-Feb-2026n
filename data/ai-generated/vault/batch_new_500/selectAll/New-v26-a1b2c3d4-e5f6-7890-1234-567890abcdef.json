He presented to the ED at 06:30 complaining of substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm, rated 8/10. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I was elevated at 2.5 ng/mL. He received aspirin 325 mg and nitroglycerin sublingually in the ED. ASSESSMENT: At 10:00, the patient reports continued chest pain, now 5/10. BP is 90/60 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Skin is cool and clammy. The patient is drowsy. ECG shows persistent ST elevation. Current medications include metoprolol 25mg PO BID and atorvastatin 40mg PO daily. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate intervention to address the bradycardia and hypotension, and further evaluation for possible reperfusion therapy.",

Atropine is a first-line treatment for symptomatic bradycardia.\n\nPrepare for transcutaneous pacing if atropine is ineffective. Given the patient's persistent bradycardia and hypotension despite initial interventions, pacing may be necessary to stabilize the heart rate and improve perfusion.\n\nNotify the physician immediately about the patient's condition. The patient's persistent chest pain, hypotension, and bradycardia, along with ST-segment elevation, indicate a critical situation requiring immediate medical intervention.\n\nElevate the patient's legs. Raising the legs can help increase venous return to the heart, which can improve cardiac output and blood pressure, especially in hypotensive patients.\n\nWithhold the next dose of metoprolol. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can further decrease the heart rate and blood pressure. Given the patient's bradycardia and hypotension, holding the metoprolol is appropriate to prevent further hemodynamic compromise.",

While ensuring adequate oxygenation is important, the patient's SpO2 is 94% on 2L NC, which is acceptable.
