This includes wearing gloves and gowns upon entering the patient's room and proper hand hygiene after removal. ClinicalPearl: MDROs require vigilant infection control.\nAdministering prescribed vasopressors will help to increase the patient's blood pressure, improving perfusion to vital organs, which is critical in septic shock. The low BP indicated in the SBAR shows this is a high priority intervention. ClinicalPearl: Septic shock necessitates BP support.\nMonitoring urine output hourly is essential to assess renal function and the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Low urine output can indicate inadequate perfusion to the kidneys. ClinicalPearl: Urine output reflects kidney perfusion.\nDrawing blood cultures from two different sites helps identify the specific organism causing the infection and guides antibiotic therapy. This is important, especially given the MDRO. ClinicalPearl: Blood cultures guide antibiotic choice.\nTitrating oxygen to maintain SpO2 >95% is important. While the patient is currently at 91% on 2L NC, titrating the oxygen to a higher setting will help to improve oxygenation and reduce the risk of tissue hypoxia. ClinicalPearl: Adequate oxygenation prevents hypoxia.",
