Initial CXR showed bilateral infiltrates. He was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\nA: Patient is developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ABG at 14:00 showed pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58, HCO3 24. Vitals at 14:15: HR 122, BP 100/60, Temp 38.8°C. Chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates.\nR: Anticipate need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Prepare for potential transfer to a higher level of care. Contact respiratory therapy for immediate assistance. Consider proning the patient after intubation. Obtain orders for sedation and paralytics as indicated.

These values confirm acute respiratory failure, necessitating ventilatory support. Prone positioning improves oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, reducing atelectasis. Obtaining orders for sedation and paralytics is essential to facilitate mechanical ventilation, minimize patient discomfort, and prevent ventilator dyssynchrony during rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Increasing the FiO2 further is unlikely to be effective as the patient is already on 60% FiO2 with minimal improvement in oxygen saturation. ClinicalPearl: ARDS often requires high levels of PEEP and FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation.",

Administering a bolus of intravenous fluids may worsen pulmonary edema in ARDS, exacerbating respiratory distress. Bronchodilators are not the primary treatment for ARDS and would not address the underlying alveolar damage and inflammation. Encouraging deep breathing and coughing may be difficult and ineffective given the patient's severe respiratory distress and fatigue.
