B: Sgt. Davis has a history of anxiety and PTSD, diagnosed 6 months ago. He reports increased anxiety and depressive symptoms over the past two weeks, triggered by nightmares and flashbacks related to combat. A: At 09:00, Sgt. Davis is oriented to person, place, and time but appears anxious and tearful. He admits to feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. He states, \"I don't see a way out.\" He denies current self-harm, but admits to having a plan to overdose on sleeping pills. Vital signs are stable. R: I recommend initiating suicide precautions, a psychiatric evaluation, and medication review. We need to create a safe environment and develop a therapeutic relationship with Sgt. Davis.",

    "correct": "Initiate one-on-one observation to ensure patient safety. Rationale: Continuous observation is crucial to prevent Sgt. Davis from acting on his suicidal ideations. This provides immediate intervention if needed.\nAdminister Lorazepam 1mg PO PRN for anxiety as prescribed. Rationale: Sgt. Davis is experiencing anxiety, which contributes to his distress and suicidal thoughts. Lorazepam can help reduce his anxiety levels, promoting a sense of calm.\nRemove potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment. Rationale: This includes items that could be used for self-harm, such as sharp objects, belts, or medications not dispensed by nursing staff. Creating a safe environment is a priority.\nEncourage the patient to verbalize his feelings and concerns. Rationale: Providing a safe space for Sgt. Davis to express his emotions can help him process his experiences and identify coping strategies. Active listening and empathy are essential.\nCollaborate with the psychiatric team for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Rationale: A thorough psychiatric evaluation is necessary to assess Sgt. Davis's mental health status and develop an individualized treatment plan, including medication management and therapy.",
    "incorrect": "Offer the patient a caffeinated beverage to help him stay awake and alert. Rationale: Caffeine can increase anxiety and agitation, which is counterproductive in a patient with suicidal ideation.\nEncourage the patient to isolate himself in his room to process his thoughts. Rationale: Isolation can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, increasing the risk of self-harm. Social interaction and support are important.\nReassure the patient that everything will be okay and his problems will eventually resolve themselves. Rationale: This minimizes the patient's feelings and may not be realistic. It's important to acknowledge his distress and offer support without false reassurance.",
