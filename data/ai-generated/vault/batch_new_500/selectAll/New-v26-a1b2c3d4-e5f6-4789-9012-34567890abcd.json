    "sbar": "Situation: Mr. Jones, a 68-year-old male, was admitted for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Background: He has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving a continuous intravenous heparin infusion. At 07:00, his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 78 seconds, which is within the therapeutic range of 60-80 seconds. The current heparin infusion rate is 1200 units/hour. Assessment: At 08:00, the patient reported slight bruising at the IV site, but no active bleeding was observed. His vital signs were: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, and SpO2 96% on room air. Current orders include daily complete blood count (CBC), aPTT, and basic metabolic panel (BMP). His last heparin bolus was administered 24 hours ago. At 08:30, the patient denied pain at the IV site, but the nurse noted mild redness. Recommendation: Continue close monitoring of aPTT levels and adjust the heparin infusion rate according to the established protocol. Notify the provider of any significant changes in the patient's condition or signs of bleeding. The next scheduled heparin dose is due at 09:00.",
