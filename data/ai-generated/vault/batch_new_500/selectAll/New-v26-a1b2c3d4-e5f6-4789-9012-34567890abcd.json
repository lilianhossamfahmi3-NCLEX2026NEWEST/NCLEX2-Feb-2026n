            "Confirm the patient's penicillin allergy before administering Vancomycin. Rationale: Vancomycin is contraindicated in patients with a penicillin allergy due to potential cross-reactivity or hypersensitivity reactions. Verifying the allergy status is crucial for patient safety.",
            "Check the patient's blood pressure before administering Labetalol. Rationale: Labetalol is an antihypertensive medication, and administering it without checking the blood pressure could lead to hypotension. The medication is prescribed PRN for SBP >160, so assessment is essential.",
            "Review the patient's creatinine and BUN levels before administering Vancomycin. Rationale: Vancomycin is nephrotoxic, and elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate impaired renal function. Administering Vancomycin in this situation could further damage the kidneys. Dose adjustment or alternative antibiotics may be necessary.",
            "Assess the patient's pain level and response to the previously administered Acetaminophen. Rationale: Assessing pain and the effectiveness of previous analgesics helps determine if additional pain management strategies are needed. This ensures adequate patient comfort and pain control.",

            "Administer the Insulin Aspart without checking the most recent blood glucose level. Rationale: Insulin Aspart is administered based on a sliding scale, which requires a current blood glucose level. Administering insulin without this information could lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia."
