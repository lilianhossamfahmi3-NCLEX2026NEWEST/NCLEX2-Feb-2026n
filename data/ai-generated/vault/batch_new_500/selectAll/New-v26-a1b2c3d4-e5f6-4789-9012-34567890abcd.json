B: Mr. Smith has a medical history significant for COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He is currently receiving oxygen at 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula. A: At 07:00, his vital signs were: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, SpO2 91% on 2L NC, and temperature 38.5°C. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count. The physician has prescribed IV antibiotics, antihypertensives, and insulin. He reported a pain level of 4 out of 10 at 07:30. R: The patient is due for scheduled IV medications at 08:00, including Vancomycin 1 gram IV every 12 hours, Labetalol 20 mg IV every 6 hours as needed for SBP greater than 160 mmHg, and Insulin Aspart 4 units subcutaneously now, based on the sliding scale protocol. Please review the medication administration record for any other concurrent medications and continue to monitor vital signs frequently.",
