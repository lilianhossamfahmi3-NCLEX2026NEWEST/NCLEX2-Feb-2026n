B: Liam has a history of 'tet spells', previously managed with oxygen and morphine. He's on continuous SpO2 monitoring. His baseline SpO2 has been consistently around 92%. A: At 14:15, Liam experienced a sudden drop in SpO2 to 68%. He's irritable, with circumoral cyanosis and cyanotic nailbeds. His current vital signs show a heart rate of 180 bpm and a respiratory rate of 60 bpm. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur, consistent with his known cardiac condition. Labs show elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. R: I believe Liam is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell. I recommend immediate interventions: knee-chest positioning, 100% oxygen administration, and morphine administration per physician order. I'm also concerned about potential dehydration and possible metabolic acidosis, warranting further assessment.",

    "correct": "Positioning the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood and increases pulmonary blood flow, thus improving oxygenation. Administering 100% oxygen can help increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, which can improve oxygen saturation. Administering morphine sulfate can help reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease the infant's respiratory rate and anxiety, thereby breaking the cycle of hyperventilation and hypoxemia. Calculating and preparing the morphine dose is crucial before administration to ensure accurate and timely intervention. Hypercyanotic spells can lead to cerebral hypoxia, which can cause permanent brain damage or death. Prompt administration of medications is crucial.",
    "incorrect": "Auscultating breath sounds, while important for a comprehensive assessment, is not the priority during a hypercyanotic spell. The immediate need is to improve oxygenation and reduce the shunt. Contacting the provider is essential, but the nurse should initiate interventions concurrently, not as a first step. Waiting for the provider to arrive delays critical treatment and can worsen the infant's condition. Documenting the event is important but secondary to initiating immediate interventions to stabilize the infant. Documentation should occur after the immediate crisis is addressed.",
