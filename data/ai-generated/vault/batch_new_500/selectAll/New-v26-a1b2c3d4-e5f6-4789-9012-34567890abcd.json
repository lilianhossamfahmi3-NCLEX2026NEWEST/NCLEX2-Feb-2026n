His current vitals include a BP of 100/60, HR of 120, RR of 36 (labored), SpO2 of 88% on 6L nasal cannula, and a temperature of 38.8°C. A: Mr. Tyrell has a history of COPD. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. Arterial blood gas results from 06:00 reveal pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 55, and HCO3 24. O: Auscultation reveals diffuse bilateral crackles and wheezes. A chest X-ray indicates bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Current ventilator settings are FiO2 60%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, and Tidal Volume 400 mL. At 07:00, the patient is agitated and requires frequent suctioning due to copious secretions. R: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. It is recommended to titrate ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Consider proning the patient. Continue to closely monitor for any complications.",

    "correct": "Increasing the PEEP can improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and increasing the surface area for gas exchange. Prone positioning improves oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, reducing atelectasis, and promoting drainage of secretions. Administering a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) can improve oxygenation and ventilation by reducing patient-ventilator asynchrony and decreasing oxygen consumption. Increasing the FiO2 may be necessary to improve oxygenation, but should be done judiciously to avoid oxygen toxicity. Maintaining adequate sedation helps to reduce the patient's anxiety and agitation, decreasing oxygen demand and improving ventilation.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the tidal volume would worsen the hypercapnia by not providing adequate ventilation. Maintaining the head of the bed at 30 degrees is a standard practice to prevent aspiration but is not a primary intervention to improve oxygenation in ARDS. Suctioning every 15 minutes without assessment could cause trauma to the airway and increase the risk of infection. Administering a bronchodilator may not be effective in this case as the patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated; the primary issue is ARDS, not bronchospasm.",
