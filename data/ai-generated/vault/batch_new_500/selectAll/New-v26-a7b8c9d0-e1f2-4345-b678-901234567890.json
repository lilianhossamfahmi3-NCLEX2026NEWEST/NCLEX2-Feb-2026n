    "sbar": "Situation: Robert Miller, a 68-year-old male, is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Background: Mr. Miller was admitted three days ago with a productive cough, fever, and shortness of breath. He has a history of COPD and hypertension. Assessment: At 07:00, his vital signs are: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 16 (ventilator settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 500 mL), SpO2 92%. He is on continuous sedation with propofol. Lung sounds reveal coarse crackles bilaterally. ETCO2 is 38 mmHg. Current medications include vancomycin and azithromycin. Recommendation: Please assess for signs of VAP and continue vigilant respiratory care. At 08:00, note increased secretions and decreased oxygen saturation to 89%. Consider suctioning and potential changes in ventilator settings. Assess sedation level per RASS scale.",

    "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees reduces the risk of aspiration. Performing regular oral care with chlorhexidine decreases the bacterial load in the mouth, reducing the risk of VAP. Suctioning secretions when needed prevents pooling of secretions and bacterial colonization in the lower airways. Ensuring proper hand hygiene before and after patient contact is crucial to prevent the spread of infection. Assessing endotracheal tube cuff pressure regularly (aiming for 20-30 cm H2O) prevents leakage of secretions into the lower airway.",
    "incorrect": "Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended due to the risk of antibiotic resistance. While repositioning is important for preventing pressure ulcers, it does not directly address VAP prevention. Increasing the FiO2 to 100% is not a preventative measure for VAP and can lead to oxygen toxicity. Instilling normal saline before suctioning is no longer recommended as it can dislodge bacteria deeper into the lungs.",
