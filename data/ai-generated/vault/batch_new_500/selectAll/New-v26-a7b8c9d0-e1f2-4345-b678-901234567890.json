Background: Mr. Miller was admitted three days ago with a productive cough, fever, and shortness of breath. He has a history of COPD and hypertension. Assessment: At 0700, his vital signs are: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 16 (ventilator settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 500 mL), SpO2 92%. He is on continuous sedation with propofol. Lung sounds reveal coarse crackles bilaterally. ETCO2 is 38 mmHg. Current medications include vancomycin and azithromycin. Recommendation: Please assess for signs of VAP and continue vigilant respiratory care. At 0800, note increased secretions and decreased oxygen saturation to 89%. Consider suctioning and potential changes in ventilator settings. Assess sedation level per RASS scale.",

Oral care with chlorhexidine reduces oral bacterial colonization, decreasing the risk of lower respiratory tract infection. Suctioning removes accumulated secretions, preventing bacterial pooling and colonization. Hand hygiene prevents the transmission of pathogens. Maintaining appropriate endotracheal tube cuff pressure (20-30 cm H2O) prevents leakage of contaminated secretions into the lower airway. Clinical Pearl: VAP significantly increases morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients.",

Repositioning prevents pressure ulcers but does not directly prevent VAP. Increasing FiO2 to 100% can cause oxygen toxicity and does not prevent VAP. Instilling normal saline before suctioning can push bacteria deeper into the lungs and is not recommended. Question Trap: Some options are general nursing interventions, but the question asks specifically about VAP prevention.",
