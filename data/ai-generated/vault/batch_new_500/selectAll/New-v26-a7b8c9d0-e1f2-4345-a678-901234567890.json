BACKGROUND: Liam was diagnosed with TOF at birth and is scheduled for surgical repair next month. He has had previous TET spells managed at home with knee-chest positioning. ASSESSMENT: At 08:00, the infant is cyanotic, irritable, with increased respiratory rate (60 breaths/min) and heart rate (180 bpm). Oxygen saturation is 65%. Current medications include PRN morphine sulfate. The infant's mother reports the spell started approximately 15 minutes ago. Recent lab values show a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit. RECOMMENDATION: Please assess and implement interventions to manage the hypercyanotic spell, including administering oxygen, positioning, and administering morphine sulfate as needed. Notify the provider immediately if there is no improvement in the patient’s condition.",

Fluid boluses are not the first-line treatment and could potentially worsen the situation by increasing preload without addressing the underlying cause.",
