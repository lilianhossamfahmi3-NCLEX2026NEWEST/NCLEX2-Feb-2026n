He reports a severe, throbbing headache, rated 8/10, and nasal congestion. Background: He has a history of neurogenic bowel and bladder and was at rehab post spinal cord injury. His last bowel movement was three days ago. He denies recent medication changes and reports feeling anxious. Assessment: Current vital signs at 13:45: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 98.8°F (37.1°C). He is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of his injury. He is on continuous cardiac monitoring. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to address his elevated blood pressure, including elevating the head of the bed and assessing for potential triggers like bladder distension or bowel impaction. We need orders to address the autonomic dysreflexia and manage his pain. Please review his PRN medication orders upon admission.",

It is the immediate priority.\nAssess for bladder distension or bowel impaction. These are common triggers for autonomic dysreflexia and should be addressed promptly. Catheterize the client if needed and check for bowel impaction.\nLoosen any constrictive clothing or devices. Anything that is tight or restrictive can exacerbate the hypertensive response. This includes blood pressure cuffs and abdominal binders.\nAdminister antihypertensive medication as prescribed. While medication is important, addressing the underlying cause and positioning are higher priorities.\nMonitor blood pressure every 5 minutes. Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any changes in the client's condition.",

While oxygen may be considered if the client's oxygen saturation is low, it is not the priority intervention in this scenario, as the client's SpO2 is 98%.\nNotify the healthcare provider. While it is important to keep the healthcare provider informed, the nurse should initiate immediate interventions to address the client's critical condition *before* contacting the provider. The nurse should notify the provider after initiating interventions.\nDocument the findings in the electronic health record. Documentation is important, but it is not the priority intervention.
