His last bowel movement was three days ago. He denies any recent medication changes and reports feeling anxious and restless. Assessment: Current vital signs at 13:45 are: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, and Temp 98.8°F (37.1°C). He is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of his injury (T6). Continuous cardiac monitoring is in place. Recommendation: I recommend immediate interventions to address his severely elevated blood pressure. This includes elevating the head of the bed to at least 45 degrees and urgently assessing for potential triggers such as bladder distension or bowel impaction. Please review his PRN medication orders and provide orders for managing autonomic dysreflexia, including potential antihypertensive medications. Consider a rectal exam to assess for impaction.",

        "correct": "Elevate the head of the bed. Rationale: Elevating the head of the bed helps to immediately reduce blood pressure by promoting venous pooling and decreasing venous return to the heart, thus lowering cardiac output and blood pressure. This is the priority intervention to minimize the risk of cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Assess for bladder distension or bowel impaction. Rationale: These are common triggers for autonomic dysreflexia. Bladder distension stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to a hypertensive crisis. Bowel impaction can have a similar effect. Catheterize the client if needed and check for bowel impaction. Loosen any constrictive clothing or devices. Rationale: Anything that is tight or restrictive can exacerbate the hypertensive response. This includes blood pressure cuffs and abdominal binders. Removing these helps to reduce external stimuli contributing to the dysreflexia. Administer antihypertensive medication as prescribed. Rationale: While medication is important, addressing the underlying cause and positioning are higher priorities. Antihypertensives will help lower blood pressure but do not address the underlying trigger. Monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes. Rationale: Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any changes in the client's condition. This allows for timely adjustments to the treatment plan.",
        "incorrect": "Administer oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. Rationale: While oxygen may be considered if the client's oxygen saturation is low, it is not the priority intervention in this scenario, as the client's SpO2 is 98%. Autonomic dysreflexia primarily involves a hypertensive crisis, not hypoxemia. Notify the healthcare provider. Rationale: While it is important to keep the healthcare provider informed, the nurse should initiate immediate interventions to address the client's critical condition *before* contacting the provider. The nurse should notify the provider after initiating interventions. Document the findings in the electronic health record. Rationale: Documentation is important, but it is not the priority intervention. The nurse must first address the client's critical condition.",
