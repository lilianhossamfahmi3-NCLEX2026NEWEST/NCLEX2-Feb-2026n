        "correct": "Administer 0.9% Normal Saline intravenously: HHS causes severe dehydration due to osmotic diuresis. Rapid rehydration is crucial to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion to vital organs. Normal saline is preferred initially due to the patient's hypernatremia. Initiate continuous IV insulin infusion: While no ketones are present, the extremely elevated glucose level requires insulin to facilitate glucose uptake by cells and lower serum glucose. A continuous infusion allows for precise titration. Monitor serum potassium levels closely: HHS can cause potassium shifts. Insulin administration drives potassium into cells, potentially leading to hypokalemia. Replacement is essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Implement seizure precautions: The combination of hyperosmolality and electrolyte imbalances increases the risk of seizures. Taking precautions to prevent injury is paramount. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring: Electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and potential for arrhythmias necessitate continuous cardiac monitoring to detect and respond to any changes promptly.",
        "incorrect": "Administer a bolus of D50W intravenously: While hypoglycemia can occur during treatment of HHS, the patient's initial glucose is extremely elevated. Administering D50W would worsen hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. Restricting fluids to 1000 mL per 24 hours: Fluid restriction is contraindicated in HHS. The patient is severely dehydrated and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation. Administer sodium bicarbonate intravenously: While the patient's pH is slightly low, it does not meet the criteria for bicarbonate administration in HHS. Bicarbonate is generally reserved for cases of severe acidosis (pH < 7.0). Encourage oral intake of clear liquids: The patient is lethargic and at risk for aspiration. Oral intake is contraindicated until the patient's mental status improves and swallowing can be safely assessed.",
