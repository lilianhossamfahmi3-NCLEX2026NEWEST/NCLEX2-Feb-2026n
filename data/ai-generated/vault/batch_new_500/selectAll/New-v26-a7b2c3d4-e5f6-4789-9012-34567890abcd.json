        "correct": "Administer furosemide 40 mg IV STAT: Furosemide is a loop diuretic that reduces preload by promoting fluid excretion, thereby alleviating pulmonary congestion and improving oxygenation in ADHF. Clinical Pearl: Monitor potassium levels as furosemide can cause hypokalemia.\nAdminister morphine sulfate 2 mg IV PRN pain: Morphine reduces pain and anxiety, which can decrease myocardial oxygen demand and improve cardiac output. It also causes vasodilation, further reducing preload and afterload. Clinical Pearl: Monitor respiratory rate and blood pressure as morphine can cause respiratory depression and hypotension.\nElevate the head of the bed to a high Fowler's position: Elevating the head of the bed promotes lung expansion and reduces venous return to the heart, decreasing preload and easing breathing. Clinical Pearl: Ensure patient comfort and prevent skin breakdown with proper positioning.\nMonitor vital signs every 5 minutes: Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the patient's response to interventions and detect any deterioration in condition, such as worsening hypotension or dysrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Document vital signs accurately and promptly report significant changes.\nPrepare for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation: The patient's SpO2 is low despite supplemental oxygen, and RR is high. This indicates potential respiratory failure, necessitating advanced airway management. Clinical Pearl: Have intubation equipment readily available and ensure staff are trained in advanced airway management.",
        "incorrect": "Administer a bolus of normal saline: Administering a fluid bolus is contraindicated in ADHF as it can worsen pulmonary congestion and increase cardiac workload, potentially leading to further decompensation. The patient needs preload reduction, not expansion. Question Trap: Nurses may think fluids are needed for hypotension, but ADHF-related hypotension requires diuresis.\nEncourage the patient to ambulate to the bathroom: Ambulation is contraindicated due to the patient's acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemodynamic instability. It could exacerbate the patient's condition and increase myocardial oxygen demand. Question Trap: Promoting early ambulation is generally good, but not in acute, unstable conditions.\nReduce oxygen delivery to 2 L via nasal cannula: The patient's current SpO2 is low (90% on 4L), indicating inadequate oxygenation. Reducing oxygen delivery would worsen hypoxemia and could lead to further complications. The goal is to improve, not reduce, oxygenation. Question Trap: Nurses may reduce oxygen if SpO2 is 'okay,' but 90% is the lower limit in this case.\nAdminister potassium chloride 20 mEq IV: While the patient's potassium is slightly low, other interventions take priority. Administering KCl without assessing renal function and cardiac monitoring could lead to hyperkalemia, especially if the patient's renal perfusion is compromised due to low BP. Question Trap: Addressing electrolyte imbalances is important, but not the priority in this acute situation.",
