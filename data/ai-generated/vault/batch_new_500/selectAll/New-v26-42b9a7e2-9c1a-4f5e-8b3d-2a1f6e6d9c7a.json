BACKGROUND: Michael was diagnosed at birth and is scheduled for surgical repair at 9 months. He has a history of 'tet spells' managed at home with supplemental oxygen. ASSESSMENT: At 07:00, his SpO2 is 78% despite 2L nasal cannula. He is tachypneic (RR 60), HR 180, and irritable. Weight is 7 kg. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. Capillary refill is prolonged at 4 seconds. Mother reports a prolonged crying episode prior to this exacerbation. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate interventions to manage the hypercyanotic spell, including positioning, oxygen adjustments, and morphine administration per physician order if SpO2 doesn't improve. Please provide orders for medication and further interventions needed. Plan for surgical consult.",
