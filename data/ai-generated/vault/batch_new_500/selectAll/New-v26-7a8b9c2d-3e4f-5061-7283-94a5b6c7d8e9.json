        "correct": "Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees: This is the initial intervention to reduce blood pressure by promoting venous pooling and decreasing cardiac workload. This helps to immediately counteract the hypertensive crisis.\nAssess for bladder distension: Bladder distension is the most common cause of autonomic dysreflexia. Catheterize the patient if indicated to relieve pressure. The distended bladder triggers a cascade of autonomic responses leading to hypertension.\nLoosen any tight clothing: Removing restrictive clothing, such as abdominal binders or tight socks, can improve circulation and reduce blood pressure. Tight clothing can exacerbate the hypertensive response.\nCheck the patient's bowel for impaction: Bowel impaction is another common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Perform a digital rectal examination to assess for and remove any impaction. The stimulation from the impaction causes a sympathetic nervous system surge.\nAdminister PRN Hydralazine 10mg IV as ordered: Hydralazine is an antihypertensive medication used to treat severe hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia. Given the elevated BP, this is warranted after initial interventions to address the underlying cause. Hydralazine directly relaxes arteriolar smooth muscle, reducing peripheral resistance.",

Delaying critical interventions while waiting to notify the physician could lead to serious complications. This action delays immediate treatment.\nAdminister oxygen at 2L/min via nasal cannula: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on room air, indicating adequate oxygenation. Administering supplemental oxygen is not indicated at this time and would not address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Oxygen administration is not indicated based on the provided data.",
