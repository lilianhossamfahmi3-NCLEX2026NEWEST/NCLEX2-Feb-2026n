    "sbar": "S: James Riley, a 28-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury, is experiencing symptoms indicative of autonomic dysreflexia, including a severe headache and nasal congestion. He reports feeling unwell.\nB: Mr. Riley has a history of a T6 spinal cord injury sustained three years ago in a motor vehicle accident. He independently manages his bowel program and intermittent catheterization at home. He is familiar with the signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and typically manages episodes at home.\nA: At 14:00, the patient's vital signs are significantly elevated: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm. He presents with a flushed face, diaphoresis above the T6 level, and nasal congestion. He is alert and oriented but reports a throbbing headache.\nR: I recommend immediate interventions to address the dangerously elevated blood pressure and identify the underlying trigger for this episode of autonomic dysreflexia. I will continue to closely monitor his vital signs, neurological status, and implement interventions per protocol.",

    "correct": "Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees: This is the initial intervention to reduce blood pressure by promoting venous pooling and decreasing cardiac workload.\nAssess for bladder distension: Bladder distention is the most common cause of autonomic dysreflexia. Catheterize the patient if indicated to relieve pressure.\nLoosen any tight clothing: Removing restrictive clothing, such as abdominal binders or tight socks, can improve circulation and reduce blood pressure.\nCheck the patient's bowel for impaction: Bowel impaction is another common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Perform a digital rectal examination to assess for and remove any impaction.\nAdminister PRN Hydralazine 10mg IV as ordered: Hydralazine is an antihypertensive medication used to treat severe hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia. Given the elevated BP, this is warranted after initial interventions to address the underlying cause.",
    "incorrect": "Notify the physician: While notifying the physician is important to update them on the patient's status and response to treatment, the nurse should first implement interventions to address the immediate threat to the patient's safety. Delaying critical interventions while waiting to notify the physician could lead to serious complications.\nAdminister oxygen at 2L/min via nasal cannula: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on room air, indicating adequate oxygenation. Administering supplemental oxygen is not indicated at this time and would not address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia.",
