        "correct": "Assess for bladder distension: Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Check catheter patency and resolve any kinks. ClinicalPearl: Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia due to the stimulation of sensory receptors in the bladder wall, which sends signals to the spinal cord, triggering a massive sympathetic response. QuestionTrap: Overlooking bladder distension can lead to a delay in addressing the primary cause of autonomic dysreflexia, potentially worsening the patient's condition.\nElevate the head of the bed: Elevating the head of the bed to a high-Fowler's position helps lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. ClinicalPearl: Elevating the head of the bed can quickly reduce blood pressure by increasing venous return and decreasing cardiac output. QuestionTrap: Failing to elevate the head of the bed can delay the reduction of dangerously high blood pressure, increasing the risk of complications.\nMonitor blood pressure every 5 minutes: Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect further changes in blood pressure. ClinicalPearl: Close monitoring allows for timely adjustments to the treatment plan and helps prevent severe complications. QuestionTrap: Infrequent monitoring can result in delayed recognition of worsening hypertension, leading to potential end-organ damage.\nLoosen any restrictive clothing: Restrictive clothing can exacerbate the hypertensive response. Removing or loosening clothing can help reduce the stimulus. ClinicalPearl: Restrictive clothing can act as a noxious stimulus, triggering or worsening autonomic dysreflexia. QuestionTrap: Ignoring restrictive clothing can perpetuate the hypertensive crisis, hindering the effectiveness of other interventions.\nCheck for bowel impaction: Bowel impaction is another common trigger. Perform a digital rectal examination to assess for impaction after bladder issues are ruled out. ClinicalPearl: Bowel impaction stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to a hypertensive crisis in patients with spinal cord injuries. QuestionTrap: Neglecting to assess for bowel impaction can prolong the hypertensive episode and increase the risk of complications.",
        "incorrect": "Administer acetaminophen 650mg PO: While the patient reports a headache, the priority is to address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Acetaminophen will not resolve the hypertension. ClinicalPearl: Acetaminophen addresses the symptom (headache) but not the underlying cause (autonomic dysreflexia). QuestionTrap: Focusing solely on the headache can distract from the more critical interventions needed to manage the hypertensive crisis.\nIncrease IV fluid rate: Increasing IV fluids may worsen the hypertension. Fluid overload is contraindicated in this situation. ClinicalPearl: Increasing IV fluids can exacerbate hypertension by increasing circulating volume. QuestionTrap: Administering fluids can worsen the hypertensive crisis and potentially lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.",

            "trap": "The question trap lies in focusing solely on the headache without recognizing it as a symptom of the more serious condition of autonomic dysreflexia.

Recognize that the severe headache, blurred vision, and elevated blood pressure in a patient with a T6 spinal cord injury strongly suggest autonomic dysreflexia, necessitating interventions to address the hypertensive crisis."
