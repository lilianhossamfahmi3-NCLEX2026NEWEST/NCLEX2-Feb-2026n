The patient rates the headache as an 8/10 at 10:00. B: He sustained the spinal cord injury in a motor vehicle accident 5 years ago and typically manages at home with assistance for daily activities. A: Current vital signs at 10:00 are: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 20 breaths per minute, and SpO2 98% on room air. The skin is flushed above the level of the injury and pale and cool below. The patient is also diaphoretic. Catheterized urine output has been 30 mL over the last hour. The patient reports a bowel movement two days ago. O: I suspect the patient is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. This requires immediate nursing interventions and notification of the healthcare provider STAT due to the risk of stroke or seizure.",

    "correct": "Assess for bladder distension: Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Catheter patency should be checked and any kinks resolved.\nElevate the head of the bed: Elevating the head of the bed to a high-Fowler's position helps to lower the blood pressure by promoting venous pooling.\nMonitor blood pressure every 5 minutes: Frequent monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to detect further changes in blood pressure.\nLoosen any restrictive clothing: Restrictive clothing can exacerbate the hypertensive response. Removing or loosening clothing can help to reduce the stimulus.\nCheck for bowel impaction: Bowel impaction is another common trigger. A digital rectal examination should be performed to assess for impaction after bladder issues are ruled out.",
    "incorrect": "Administer acetaminophen 650mg PO: While the patient reports a headache, the priority is to address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Acetaminophen will not resolve the hypertension.\nIncrease IV fluid rate: Increasing IV fluids may worsen the hypertension. Fluid overload is contraindicated in this situation.",

      "trap": "The question trap lies in focusing solely on the headache without recognizing it as a symptom of the more serious condition of autonomic dysreflexia.

Recognize that the severe headache, blurred vision, and elevated blood pressure in a patient with a T6 spinal cord injury strongly suggest autonomic dysreflexia, necessitating interventions to address the hypertensive crisis."
