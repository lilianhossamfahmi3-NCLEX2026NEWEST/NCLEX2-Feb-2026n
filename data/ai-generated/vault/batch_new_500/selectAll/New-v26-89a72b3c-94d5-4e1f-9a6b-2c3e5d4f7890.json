        "correct": "Administering the prescribed cefepime is crucial to target the suspected bacterial infection causing the sepsis. Timely antibiotic administration is a cornerstone of sepsis management, improving patient outcomes by reducing the bacterial load and preventing further organ damage. Increasing the rate of IV fluids is essential to address the patient's hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. Sepsis often leads to vasodilation and fluid shifts, necessitating aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ function. Monitoring urine output is vital to assess the patient's renal function and response to fluid resuscitation. Decreased urine output can indicate inadequate perfusion or kidney injury, requiring further intervention. Drawing blood cultures helps identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures should be obtained before antibiotic administration whenever possible to ensure accurate identification of the pathogen. Monitoring the patient's lactate level helps assess the severity of sepsis and the effectiveness of treatment. Elevated lactate levels indicate tissue hypoxia, reflecting the body's inadequate oxygen supply to tissues due to impaired circulation and oxygen utilization.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is not a priority at this time. While fever management is important, addressing the underlying sepsis and stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status are the immediate concerns. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees may be considered for comfort and to improve respiratory function, but it is not a priority intervention in this scenario given the patient's hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is critically low, and Trendelenburg position is contraindicated. It may worsen respiratory distress and increase intracranial pressure, further compromising the patient's condition.",
