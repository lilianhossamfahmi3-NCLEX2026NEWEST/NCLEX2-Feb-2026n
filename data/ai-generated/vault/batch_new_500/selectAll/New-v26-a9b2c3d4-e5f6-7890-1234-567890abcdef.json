Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that can further decrease blood pressure and exacerbate hypovolemia. Reviewing the potassium level (3.2 mEq/L) is essential before administering furosemide, as the medication can lead to further potassium loss, potentially causing cardiac arrhythmias. Contacting the provider to report the patient's hypotension, palpitations, and low potassium level is a priority. This warrants a re-evaluation of the furosemide order and potassium replacement strategy. Assess the patient's orthostatic blood pressure to further evaluate the extent of his hypovolemia and guide fluid replacement strategies. Palpating peripheral pulses helps assess perfusion status.",
