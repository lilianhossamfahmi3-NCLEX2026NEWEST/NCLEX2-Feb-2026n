B: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, well-managed with medications at home. He was started on IV ceftriaxone and furosemide 40mg IVP BID at 08:00 today. A: Currently, he is alert and oriented, but complaining of palpitations and slight dizziness. His BP is 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, and SpO2 is 94% on 2L nasal cannula. I&O are being closely monitored. His potassium level is also concerning. R: I'm concerned about Mr. Jones' low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and low potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L. His next dose of furosemide is due at 20:00. I am requesting an order change for the furosemide, possibly holding the dose, and an assessment for further potassium replacement. Could you please review the 12:00 lab results, which are now available?",

    "correct": "Withholding the furosemide dose is crucial due to the patient's current hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that can further decrease blood pressure and exacerbate hypovolemia. Reviewing the potassium level (3.2 mEq/L) is essential before administering furosemide, as the medication can lead to further potassium loss, potentially causing cardiac arrhythmias. Contacting the provider to report the patient's hypotension, palpitations, and low potassium level is a priority. This warrants a re-evaluation of the furosemide order and potassium replacement strategy. Assess the patient's orthostatic blood pressure to further evaluate the extent of his hypovolemia and guide fluid replacement strategies.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the potassium chloride as scheduled is appropriate to address the patient's hypokalemia. However, it does not address the immediate concern of hypotension. Auscultating lung sounds, while important for assessing pneumonia, is not the priority action in the context of hypotension and hypokalemia. Documenting the medication administration after ensuring patient safety is standard practice but secondary to addressing the immediate concerns. Palpating peripheral pulses is part of a comprehensive assessment, but is not the MOST critical action before administering the medications in this scenario.",
