Urine output has been minimal (15 mL/hr) for the past 2 hours. Patient appears pale and diaphoretic. A: Patient is hypotensive and tachycardic, showing signs of hypovolemic shock. Recent blood loss during surgery and inadequate fluid resuscitation are suspected. B: History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and AAA. Surgical repair yesterday. Baseline BP was typically 140/90 mmHg. Received 2 units PRBCs intraoperatively. C: I am concerned about the patient's deteriorating condition and suspect hypovolemic shock. I recommend immediate intervention to stabilize his hemodynamics. Would like orders for fluid bolus and possible vasopressor support. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are trending down.",
