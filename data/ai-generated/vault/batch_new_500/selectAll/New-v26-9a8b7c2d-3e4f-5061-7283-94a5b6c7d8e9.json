His current oxygen saturation is 78% on room air. Respiratory rate is 48 breaths per minute, and heart rate is 180 beats per minute. O: Upon assessment, the infant exhibits circumoral cyanosis and nasal flaring. B: The mother reports that Bobby has been more irritable and feeding poorly over the past 24 hours. She indicates a history of “tet spells.” Bobby was diagnosed with TOF at 2 weeks of age and has been followed by cardiology. A: Currently, Bobby is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell, likely due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Immediate interventions are crucial to improve oxygenation and stabilize his condition. R: I am requesting orders for morphine sulfate IV, oxygen administration via nasal cannula, and guidance on knee-chest positioning. I have prepared Propranolol IV for possible administration if the spell continues. Please notify me immediately if there is no improvement within 5 minutes. Labs were drawn at 07:15. The current time is 07:20.",

    "correct": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which helps to decrease the right-to-left shunt and subsequently improve pulmonary blood flow, leading to increased oxygen saturation. Administering morphine sulfate helps to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and reduce agitation, further improving oxygenation. Administering oxygen helps to increase the oxygen saturation. Frequent monitoring of vital signs is crucial to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect any deterioration in the infant's condition. Preparing to administer Propranolol IV will help to decrease HR and decrease the severity of the hypercyanotic spell.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging the mother to breastfeed during a hypercyanotic spell is contraindicated because it increases the infant's oxygen demand and can exacerbate the spell. Drawing arterial blood gases (ABGs) is important for monitoring the infant's overall status, but it is not the immediate priority during a hypercyanotic spell. Applying a cool compress to the forehead will not help to resolve a hypercyanotic spell, although it could be used to address fever. Elevating the head of the bed alone is not sufficient to improve oxygenation during a hypercyanotic spell; the knee-chest position is more effective in this situation.",
