A: Patient unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation. UOP 15 mL/hr. Lactate 4.8 mmol/L. WBC 18,000/µL. Blood cultures pending. Vasoactive support initiated at 04:00 with norepinephrine at 5 mcg/min. B: Continue to monitor vital signs closely. Increase norepinephrine as needed per protocol. Obtain repeat lactate level in 2 hours. Consider arterial line insertion for continuous BP monitoring. Broad-spectrum antibiotics ordered; ensure timely administration. Assess for source of infection. Monitor urine output hourly. Check peripheral perfusion and mental status frequently. Evaluate need for advanced airway management.

    "correct": "Increasing the norepinephrine infusion rate is appropriate to maintain adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion. The patient's current BP of 92/56 is still low, indicating a need for further vasopressor support. Initiating continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring allows for real-time assessment of BP and titration of vasoactive medications. The patient's urine output of 15 mL/hr indicates inadequate renal perfusion, necessitating close monitoring. Administering scheduled antibiotics promptly is crucial to combat the underlying infection and prevent further deterioration. Obtaining a repeat lactate level in 2 hours is important to assess the effectiveness of interventions and guide further treatment. A decreasing lactate level indicates improved tissue perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a rapid fluid bolus of 1000 mL of normal saline may worsen pulmonary edema or fluid overload, particularly given the patient's marginal response to the initial fluid bolus and decreased urine output. While supplemental oxygen is important, increasing the oxygen flow rate may not address the underlying issue of poor tissue perfusion caused by shock. The patient is already on 4L NC; further interventions may be needed if oxygenation does not improve. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can impair respiratory function and increase intracranial pressure without significantly improving blood pressure. Decreasing the norepinephrine infusion is inappropriate because the patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating a need for continued vasopressor support.",
