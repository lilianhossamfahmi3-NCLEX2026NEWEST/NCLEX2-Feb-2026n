B: He presented to the ED complaining of epigastric pain radiating to his back. His amylase and lipase levels were significantly elevated. He's been NPO since admission. A: At 07:00, the patient reports pain level of 7/10. His abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Vital signs are stable: BP 130/80, HR 92, RR 20, SpO2 97% on room air, Temp 38.2°C (100.8°F). He received morphine 4mg IV at 04:00. O: I've assessed his pain, vital signs, and abdominal status. I’ve reviewed his labs and current orders. I recommend continued pain management, NPO status, and monitoring for complications such as hypocalcemia.",

    "correct": "Administering intravenous fluids is crucial to maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances often seen in pancreatitis. NPO status helps to reduce stimulation of the pancreas, allowing it to rest and heal. Monitoring serum calcium levels is essential because hypocalcemia is a common complication of pancreatitis due to saponification. Administering analgesics, such as opioids, is necessary to manage the severe abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis. Inserting a nasogastric tube for suction can help to relieve abdominal distention and remove gastric secretions, further reducing pancreatic stimulation.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis as it stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion, worsening the inflammation. Providing a high-fat diet would also stimulate pancreatic enzyme release, exacerbating the condition. Administering oral antacids may not be effective in managing the pain and inflammation associated with acute pancreatitis, and may interfere with the absorption of other medications. Ambulation would increase metabolic demand, and may be too painful for the patient in this condition.",
