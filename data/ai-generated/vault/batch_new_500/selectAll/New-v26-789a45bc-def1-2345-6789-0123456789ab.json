O2 saturation dropping despite increased FiO2.\nR: He has a history of COPD and hypertension. He developed a severe cough and shortness of breath prior to admission. Initial blood cultures positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. He's been on vancomycin and azithromycin.\nA: At 07:00, his vital signs are: HR 122, RR 34, BP 90/60, SpO2 88% on FiO2 0.6 via mechanical ventilation, and temperature 38.9°C. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is elevated. P: I need recommendations for managing his ARDS, especially regarding ventilation strategies and potential interventions to improve oxygenation.",
