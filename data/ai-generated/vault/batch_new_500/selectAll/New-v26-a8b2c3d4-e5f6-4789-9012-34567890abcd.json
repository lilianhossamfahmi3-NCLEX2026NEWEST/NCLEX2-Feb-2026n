B: Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on elevated amylase and lipase levels. He received morphine 4mg IV at 03:30 for pain. A: At 07:00, the patient reports persistent pain (7/10), remains nauseous. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 38.5°C. Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. I&O is being monitored. UOP is 20 mL/hr. Bowel sounds hypoactive. Awaiting lab results.

Potassium replacement is essential to maintain cardiac stability. Institute NPO status. NPO status is crucial to reduce pancreatic stimulation and allow the pancreas to rest and heal. Initiate insulin sliding scale. Hyperglycemia is common due to pancreatic cell damage and impaired insulin production. Insulin is needed to control blood glucose levels. Monitor serum calcium levels. Hypocalcemia is a potential complication of pancreatitis due to saponification. Monitoring allows for early detection and intervention. Administer IV fluids as prescribed.

While important for preventing complications like pneumonia and DVT, it may exacerbate pain and increase metabolic demand on the pancreas in the acute phase.
