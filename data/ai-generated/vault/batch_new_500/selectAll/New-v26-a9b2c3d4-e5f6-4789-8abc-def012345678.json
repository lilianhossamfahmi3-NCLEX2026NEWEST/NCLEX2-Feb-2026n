Settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 16. Saturation 94% on current settings. 1300 ABG: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55, PaO2 88, HCO3 25. Patient is receiving continuous sedation with propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and fentanyl 50 mcg IV q1hr PRN pain. 1430 Oral care performed with chlorhexidine. NG tube placed for gastric decompression. Patient is hemodynamically stable. Noted copious secretions with frequent suctioning. Current lung sounds with diffuse rhonchi. Please continue to monitor respiratory status and prevent complications associated with mechanical ventilation. Maintain head of bed elevation at 30-45 degrees. Next fentanyl due at 1600 if needed. Notify for any changes.",

    "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed at a 30-45 degree angle reduces the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. Regular oral care with chlorhexidine can reduce the bacterial load in the oral cavity, decreasing the risk of VAP. Routine suctioning of secretions helps to remove pooled secretions that can harbor bacteria and contribute to VAP. Ensuring proper hand hygiene before and after any patient contact is crucial to prevent the spread of infection. Assessing the patient's readiness for extubation daily can help to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is a major risk factor for VAP.",
    "incorrect": "Administering prophylactic antibiotics to all ventilated patients is not recommended as it can lead to antibiotic resistance and may not be necessary for all patients. Normal saline instillation before suctioning can disrupt the mucociliary clearance mechanism and does not effectively remove secretions. It can also increase the risk of introducing bacteria deeper into the lungs. Changing ventilator circuits daily is not recommended as it does not significantly reduce the risk of VAP and can increase the risk of contamination. Avoiding sedation altogether is not always possible or appropriate, as sedation may be necessary to ensure patient comfort and synchrony with the ventilator. However, minimizing sedation and using daily sedation vacations are recommended to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.",
