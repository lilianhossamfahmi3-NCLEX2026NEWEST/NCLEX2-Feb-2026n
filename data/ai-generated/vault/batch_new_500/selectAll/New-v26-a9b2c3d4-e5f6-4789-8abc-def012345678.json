He's currently on mechanical ventilation, FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL, rate 16. Saturation is fluctuating between 90-92%. He's on continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl. His last ABG at 14:00 showed pH 7.32, PaCO2 50, PaO2 65, HCO3 24. He has a new onset of purulent sputum. Temperature is 38.5°C. Chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates. White blood cell count is elevated at 15,000. We are awaiting culture results. I'm concerned about possible VAP. Patient is on contact and droplet precautions. He is also hypotensive with a MAP of 60. I have started a bolus of NS per orders. I need orders for possible antibiotics and vasopressors.",

    "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees reduces the risk of aspiration and VAP. Performing regular oral care with chlorhexidine helps reduce the bacterial load in the oral cavity. Suctioning secretions when needed prevents accumulation and reduces the risk of aspiration. Assessing endotracheal tube cuff pressure ensures adequate sealing to prevent leakage of secretions. Minimizing sedation helps reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the risk of complications.",
    "incorrect": "Using sterile water for oral care can increase the risk of bacterial growth. Routine instillation of normal saline into the endotracheal tube is not recommended and can dislodge secretions deeper into the lungs. Changing ventilator circuits daily is not necessary and can increase the risk of contamination. Administering prophylactic antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.",
