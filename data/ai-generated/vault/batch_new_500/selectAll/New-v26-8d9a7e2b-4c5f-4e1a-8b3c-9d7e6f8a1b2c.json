            "correct": "Administer prescribed vasopressors if fluid resuscitation fails to maintain adequate blood pressure.: Vasopressors, such as norepinephrine, are often required in septic shock to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) when fluid resuscitation alone is insufficient. The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid bolus indicates a need for vasopressors. ClinicalPearl: Persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation is a key indicator for vasopressor use in septic shock.\nImplement contact precautions.: MRSA is highly contagious, and contact precautions are essential to prevent its spread to other patients and healthcare personnel. This includes wearing gloves and gowns upon entering the patient's room and proper hand hygiene. ClinicalPearl: Contact precautions are vital in preventing the spread of MRSA in healthcare settings.\nMonitor serum creatinine and BUN levels closely.: Elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest kidney injury, which is common in sepsis and can be exacerbated by nephrotoxic antibiotics like vancomycin. Close monitoring is crucial to detect worsening renal function and adjust medication dosages as needed. ClinicalPearl: Vancomycin is nephrotoxic; monitor renal function closely, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions.\nAssess IV site frequently for signs of phlebitis or infiltration.: Vancomycin is a vesicant and can cause irritation and damage to the vein if it infiltrates. Regular assessment helps prevent complications. ClinicalPearl: Vancomycin can cause phlebitis and infiltration; use a central line if peripheral IV access is poor.\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE).: While the patient has MRSA, the use of Vancomycin increases the risk of developing VRE. Monitoring for new or worsening infections, especially in the urinary tract or bloodstream, is important. ClinicalPearl: Broad-spectrum antibiotic use increases the risk of VRE; monitor for new infections.",
            "incorrect": "Discontinue Vancomycin if fever persists after 24 hours.: Vancomycin is the appropriate antibiotic for MRSA. While persistent fever warrants further investigation, discontinuing the antibiotic without consulting the provider is inappropriate. It typically takes longer than 24 hours for antibiotics to show significant effects in severe infections like septic shock. QuestionTrap: Discontinuing antibiotics prematurely can lead to antibiotic resistance and treatment failure.",
