Check the Foley catheter for kinks or obstruction. A full bladder can trigger autonomic dysreflexia by causing increased pressure and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Administer hydralazine IV per physician's order. This medication is a direct-acting peripheral arterial vasodilator that will help lower the blood pressure quickly.
