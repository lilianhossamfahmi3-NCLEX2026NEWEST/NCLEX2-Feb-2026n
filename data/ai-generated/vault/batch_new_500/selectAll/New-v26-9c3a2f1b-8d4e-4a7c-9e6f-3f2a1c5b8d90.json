Magnesium sulfate infusion was initiated during labor and discontinued 2 hours postpartum. Assessment: At 16:00, BP is 158/96, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 99.8°F (37.7°C). Deep tendon reflexes are +2. Urine output has been 80 mL in the last 2 hours. Fundus is firm at the umbilicus, with moderate lochia rubra. Patient reports a headache and blurred vision, potentially indicating neurological involvement. Recommendations: Continue to closely monitor BP and neurological status, assessing for worsening preeclampsia or postpartum hemorrhage. Strict intake and output monitoring is crucial. Manage pain, minimize stimuli, and maintain seizure precautions. Consider further lab evaluations based on trends. Notify the provider of any significant changes.",

    "correct": "Administering Labetalol IV per standing order is appropriate due to the client's elevated blood pressure (158/96 mmHg). Labetalol is an antihypertensive medication used to manage hypertension in preeclampsia. Monitoring intake and output is crucial for assessing fluid balance and kidney function, especially with preeclampsia. The low urine output (80 mL in 2 hours) is concerning and requires close monitoring. Assessing for signs of postpartum hemorrhage is essential, although the fundus is firm, the moderate lochia and borderline low platelets warrant vigilant monitoring. Preeclampsia increases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Implementing seizure precautions is necessary due to the client's preeclampsia, headache, and blurred vision, all indicating potential central nervous system irritability. These symptoms suggest a higher risk for seizures. Darkening the room and minimizing stimuli will help prevent seizures.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging ambulation is contraindicated due to the client's elevated blood pressure and potential for falls or complications from preeclampsia. Ambulation should be deferred until the blood pressure is better controlled and the patient is stable. Administering methylergonovine is contraindicated because it is a uterotonic that causes vasoconstriction, which would further elevate the client's blood pressure and exacerbate preeclampsia. It is used to treat postpartum hemorrhage related to uterine atony, not preeclampsia-induced hypertension.",
