Labs show hyponatremia, hypokalemia, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and elevated BNP. A: Acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to medication non-adherence and dietary indiscretion. R: I recommend immediate furosemide 40mg IV push, oxygen via non-rebreather, continuous cardiac monitoring, strict I&O, provider notification, and ABG consideration if SpO2 doesn't improve.

        "correct": "Administer furosemide 40mg IV push: The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload (crackles, elevated BP, low urine output), making a loop diuretic essential to reduce preload and pulmonary congestion. IV administration ensures rapid onset of action.\nInitiate oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask: The patient's SpO2 is 88% on room air, indicating hypoxemia requiring immediate intervention with a high-flow oxygen delivery system to improve oxygenation.\nContinuous cardiac monitoring: Given the history of MI and current ADHF, continuous monitoring is vital to detect arrhythmias or ST-segment changes, which can occur due to electrolyte imbalances or myocardial ischemia.\nStrict I&O monitoring: Accurately monitoring fluid balance is crucial to assess the effectiveness of diuretic therapy and guide further interventions. This helps prevent over-diuresis or persistent fluid overload.\nElevate head of bed to high Fowler's position: This position promotes lung expansion and reduces venous return, easing the patient's work of breathing and improving oxygenation. It decreases preload and pulmonary congestion.",
        "incorrect": "Administer potassium chloride 20 mEq PO: While the patient's potassium is low (3.2 mEq/L), IV administration would be preferred given the emergent situation and potential for poor absorption via the oral route in a patient with compromised circulation and respiratory distress. More importantly, addressing the fluid overload and oxygenation are higher priorities. Oral potassium is also slower to take effect.\nEncourage oral fluid intake: This is contraindicated in ADHF as it will exacerbate fluid overload and worsen the patient's respiratory distress. The patient is already volume overloaded, as evidenced by crackles and elevated blood pressure.",
