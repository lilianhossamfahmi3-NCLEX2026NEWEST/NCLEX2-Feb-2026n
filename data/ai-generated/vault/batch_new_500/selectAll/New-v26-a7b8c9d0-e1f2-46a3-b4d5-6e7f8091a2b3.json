O: At 07:00, patient is restless, exhibiting labored breathing. Oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. Heart rate 110 bpm, BP 170/100 mmHg. Urine output 30 mL/hr. A: Acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to non-adherence to medication regimen and possible dietary indiscretion. R: I recommend immediate administration of furosemide 40mg IV push, initiation of oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask, continuous cardiac monitoring, strict I&O monitoring, and notifying the provider of the patient's current status. Consider arterial blood gas (ABG) if SpO2 does not improve with oxygen therapy. Elevate head of bed to high fowler's position. Labs are pending.",

    "correct": "Administer furosemide 40mg IV push: The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload (crackles, elevated BP, low urine output), making a loop diuretic essential to reduce preload and pulmonary congestion.\nInitiate oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask: The patient's SpO2 is 88% on room air, indicating hypoxemia requiring immediate intervention with a high-flow oxygen delivery system.\nContinuous cardiac monitoring: Given the history of MI and current ADHF, continuous monitoring is vital to detect arrhythmias or ST-segment changes.\nStrict I&O monitoring: Accurately monitoring fluid balance is crucial to assess the effectiveness of diuretic therapy and guide further interventions.\nElevate head of bed to high Fowler's position: This position promotes lung expansion and reduces venous return, easing the patient's work of breathing.",
    "incorrect": "Administer potassium chloride 20 mEq PO: While the patient's potassium is low, IV administration would be preferred given the emergent situation and potential for poor absorption via the oral route in a patient with compromised circulation and respiratory distress. More importantly, addressing the fluid overload and oxygenation are higher priorities.\nEncourage oral fluid intake: This is contraindicated in ADHF as it will exacerbate fluid overload and worsen the patient's respiratory distress.",
