The provider has ordered furosemide 40mg IV push STAT, digoxin 0.125mg IV push STAT, and potassium chloride 20mEq PO BID. Current BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 58 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min. Last digoxin level was 0.7 ng/mL drawn this morning at 06:00. Potassium is 3.2 mEq/L at 08:00. Creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL at 08:00. Patient is alert and oriented x3.\nR: I recommend holding the digoxin dose and notifying the provider due to the low heart rate and borderline low blood pressure. The potassium chloride should be given after provider approval. ",
