The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation indicate respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdose, even after Narcan administration. Further intervention is needed to prevent hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest, which directly threaten the patient's life. This takes priority over other important interventions such as suicide risk assessment or involving mental health services, although those are crucial next steps.",
        "incorrect": "While performing a thorough suicide risk assessment is essential, it is not the immediate priority. The patient's physiological stability must be ensured first. A comprehensive assessment can be conducted once the patient is breathing adequately and is more responsive. \nAlthough involving the mental health crisis team is important for long-term care and management of the patient's underlying mental health issues, it is not the priority in the immediate resuscitation phase. \nInitiating continuous cardiac monitoring is a reasonable intervention, but it is secondary to ensuring adequate oxygenation. Respiratory depression is the more immediate threat to this patient's life.",
