Presented with chest pain radiating to left arm, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. A: 07:00 - Complaining of worsening chest pain (8/10), unrelieved by previous nitroglycerin administration. Noted increased dyspnea and new onset bibasilar crackles on auscultation. Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 90% on 2L nasal cannula. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. 07:15 - Patient is increasingly anxious and restless. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, and morphine. Assessment reveals possible cardiogenic shock. R: Physician notified. Requesting orders for further management of hypotension and respiratory distress. Possible need for intubation and vasopressor support. STAT ABG ordered.",

The patient is hypotensive (BP 90/60 mmHg) despite nitroglycerin administration and exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock (worsening chest pain, dyspnea, crackles, hypoxia, elevated BNP). Increasing oxygen is important, but the patient requires hemodynamic support to maintain organ perfusion. Fluid bolus could worsen pulmonary edema. Preparing for intubation is likely necessary but is secondary to stabilizing the patient's blood pressure with vasopressors.",
    "incorrect": "Preparing for immediate endotracheal intubation is incorrect. While intubation may be necessary in the near future to manage the patient's respiratory distress, the immediate priority is to address the hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. Improving blood pressure with vasopressors may improve oxygenation and reduce the immediate need for intubation. Intubation can be initiated if vasopressors are ineffective in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",
