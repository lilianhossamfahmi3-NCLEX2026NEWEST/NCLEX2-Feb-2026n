            "correct": "Initiating vasopressor support is the most appropriate initial action. The patient is hypotensive (BP 90/60 mmHg) despite nitroglycerin administration and exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock (worsening chest pain, dyspnea, crackles, hypoxia, elevated BNP, and metabolic acidosis on ABG). Vasopressors will increase systemic vascular resistance and improve blood pressure, thereby enhancing coronary and systemic perfusion. Increasing oxygen is important, but hemodynamic support is paramount. A fluid bolus could exacerbate pulmonary edema. Preparing for intubation may be necessary but is secondary to stabilizing blood pressure.",
            "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow rate alone will not address the underlying problem of cardiogenic shock. While improving oxygenation is important, the patient's hypotension and poor perfusion require immediate hemodynamic support. The ABG shows hypoxemia, but the primary issue is inadequate cardiac output. Administering a 500 mL bolus of normal saline could worsen pulmonary edema, given the presence of bibasilar crackles and elevated BNP. Cardiogenic shock impairs the heart's ability to effectively pump blood, and increasing fluid volume can lead to fluid overload and further respiratory compromise. Preparing for immediate endotracheal intubation is incorrect. While intubation may be necessary to manage respiratory distress, the immediate priority is to address hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. Vasopressors may improve oxygenation and reduce the need for intubation. Intubation can be initiated if vasopressors are ineffective in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",
