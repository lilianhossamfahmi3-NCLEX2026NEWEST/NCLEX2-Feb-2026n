    "sbar": "S: Jameson Cole, a 72-year-old male, admitted at 03:00 with acute onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech, concerning for stroke. His last known well time was 23:00 yesterday. B: Mr. Cole has a significant past medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently prescribed warfarin for anticoagulation due to his atrial fibrillation, as well as amlodipine and atorvastatin for his other chronic conditions. A: At 07:00, Mr. Cole's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 12 (E3, V4, M5), indicating a decline from earlier assessments. He continues to exhibit right-sided weakness. His pupils are equal and reactive, although sluggish. Blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg, heart rate is 90 bpm, respiratory rate is 22, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. The neurosurgeon has been promptly notified regarding these changes. R: We need to continue close neurological monitoring, with particular attention to any further decline in GCS or changes in pupillary response. Strict blood pressure control is essential to prevent further neurological damage. The patient should be prepared for potential transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for closer monitoring and management. A repeat CT scan of the head should be ordered if his neurological status deteriorates. Maintain NPO status due to risk of aspiration. Check blood glucose levels every 6 hours and keep the head of the bed elevated to promote venous drainage and minimize intracranial pressure.",

    "correct": "A: Administering stool softeners as prescribed is appropriate because it prevents straining during bowel movements. Straining can increase intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure, which in turn elevates ICP. C: Maintaining the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees is crucial to promote venous drainage from the brain, thereby reducing ICP. This position facilitates cerebral blood flow and minimizes cerebral edema. E: Monitoring serum osmolality is important because hyperosmolar solutions (like mannitol) might be used to decrease cerebral edema. Maintaining appropriate osmolality helps manage ICP by drawing fluid out of the brain tissue.",
    "incorrect": "B: Clustering nursing activities can increase ICP due to increased stimulation and oxygen demand. Spacing out activities allows for periods of rest and recovery, preventing sudden spikes in ICP. D: Encouraging coughing and deep breathing exercises can transiently increase ICP. While pulmonary hygiene is important, these activities should be approached cautiously and avoided if ICP is elevated or if the patient demonstrates signs of increased ICP. Controlled coughing, if necessary, is preferred. F: Administering hypotonic intravenous fluids can worsen cerebral edema by causing fluid to shift into brain cells, exacerbating ICP. Isotonic fluids are generally preferred in patients with increased ICP to maintain intravascular volume without increasing cerebral edema.",
