Pre-op SpO2 was 75% on room air. Vitals stable during surgery. ASSESSMENT: At 08:00, current SpO2 is 92% on 30% FiO2 via nasal cannula. Heart rate 130 bpm, regular. Respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, even and unlabored. BP 90/60 mmHg. Chest tube output 5 mL/hr serosanguineous. Incision clean, dry, and intact. Pain score 2/10 (FLACC scale), medicated with scheduled acetaminophen at 06:00. Last dose of morphine IV 0.5mg given at 02:00. Alert and irritable. Recent ABG at 07:30 showed pH 7.36, PaCO2 42 mmHg, PaO2 78 mmHg, HCO3 23 mEq/L. Hemoglobin 12 g/dL, Hematocrit 36%. RECOMMENDATION: Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Consider weaning FiO2 as tolerated. Monitor for signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, and arrhythmias. Notify provider for any significant changes.",

        "correct": "Maintaining adequate respiratory function and oxygenation is paramount in the immediate postoperative period following Tetralogy of Fallot repair. The infant's oxygen saturation (92% on 30% FiO2) and ABG values (PaO2 78 mmHg) indicate that the infant is maintaining adequate oxygenation, but close monitoring is essential to detect any early signs of respiratory compromise or hypoxemia, which can lead to significant complications in a post-operative cardiac patient. Weaning FiO2 is important but not the priority.",
        "incorrect": "While pain management is important, it is not the immediate priority compared to ensuring adequate respiratory function. The infant's current pain score (2/10) suggests that pain is adequately controlled with scheduled acetaminophen and PRN morphine. Assessing for signs of infection is important, but not the immediate priority. Assessing for bleeding is also important, but the chest tube output is minimal and the incision site appears normal, making respiratory monitoring the priority at this moment.",
