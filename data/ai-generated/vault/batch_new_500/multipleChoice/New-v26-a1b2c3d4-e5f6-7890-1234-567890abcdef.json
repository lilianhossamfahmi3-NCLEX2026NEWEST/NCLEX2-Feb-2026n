While fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement are crucial, insulin deficiency underlies DKA. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter cells, leading to hyperglycemia and fat breakdown for energy, causing ketone production and acidosis. An insulin infusion will lower blood glucose, correct metabolic acidosis, and halt ketone production.",

Rapid correction of acidosis with bicarbonate can lead to paradoxical CNS acidosis and hypokalemia. The focus should be on addressing the underlying cause of the acidosis with insulin and fluid resuscitation. Bicarbonate may be considered if the pH does not improve with these interventions, but it is not the initial priority.",
