He's been managed with propranolol. Assessment: At 0700, Liam's SpO2 is 78% on room air. Heart rate is 180 bpm, respiratory rate is 60 bpm, and he's irritable. He has 2+ edema in lower extremities. Labs show Hgb 18 g/dL, Hct 54%, and PaO2 50 mmHg. He had a 'tet' spell at 0630, resolved with knee-chest position and oxygen. Recommendation: I recommend we increase his propranolol dose and consider morphine for pain and anxiety. Prepare for possible surgical intervention if his condition doesn't improve. Vital signs were taken at 0715 and are stable after oxygen administration.",

Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt and improving pulmonary blood flow.

    "incorrect": "Encouraging vigorous crying can exacerbate cyanosis by increasing oxygen demand. Fluid restriction is generally not indicated unless there are signs of heart failure unresponsive to diuretics, and in this case, furosemide is already ordered PRN. Propranolol should not be discontinued abruptly without consulting the physician, even if the heart rate is elevated, as it helps to manage pulmonary stenosis and prevent 'tet' spells.",
