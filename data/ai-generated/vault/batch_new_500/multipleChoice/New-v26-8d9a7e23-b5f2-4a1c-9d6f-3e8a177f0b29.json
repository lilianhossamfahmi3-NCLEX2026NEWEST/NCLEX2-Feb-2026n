    "sbar": "S: Jameson Cole is a 58-year-old male admitted two days ago with acute pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol abuse. His past medical history includes hypertension and alcohol dependence. B: He presented with severe abdominal pain, intractable nausea, and frequent vomiting. His last alcoholic beverage was three days prior to admission. Vitals at 06:00: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and Temp 38.5°C. Pain is reported as 8/10. A: Mr. Cole is currently NPO and receiving continuous IV fluids and morphine via PCA for pain management. His abdomen is distended and markedly tender to palpation. Laboratory findings reveal significantly elevated amylase and lipase levels. R: Continue close monitoring of vital signs and pain levels. Implement strategies to prevent complications associated with pancreatitis. The dietitian has been consulted to plan for eventual nutritional support. Please notify the provider immediately for any signs of clinical deterioration or new concerning symptoms.",

This can manifest as Chvostek's or Trousseau's sign, and severe hypocalcemia can lead to tetany and seizures. Prompt recognition and treatment of hypocalcemia are essential to prevent complications.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging coughing and deep breathing exercises is important for all post-operative patients to prevent pneumonia, but not the MOST important intervention in this scenario. Early enteral feeding is usually avoided in the acute phase of pancreatitis. Administering pancreatic enzyme supplements is indicated for pancreatic insufficiency, which might be a later concern but not the immediate priority in acute pancreatitis. ",
