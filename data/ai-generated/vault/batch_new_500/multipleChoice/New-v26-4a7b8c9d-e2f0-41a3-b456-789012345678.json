BACKGROUND: Liam has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and was scheduled for a surgical repair consultation next week. His mother reports that he became acutely cyanotic during feeding at 10:15 this morning. ASSESSMENT: At 10:20, vital signs are as follows: heart rate 180, respiratory rate 60 with increased work of breathing, and SpO2 68% on room air. Physical examination reveals circumoral cyanosis and clubbing. Current weight is 7 kg. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. He is irritable and pulling at his chest, indicating discomfort. Labs are currently pending. RECOMMENDATION: I strongly recommend immediate intervention for a hypercyanotic spell, prioritizing interventions to improve oxygenation and reduce distress. Consider immediate knee-chest positioning, followed by morphine sulfate administration to calm the infant and reduce respiratory effort. Oxygen administration via face mask should also be initiated. Please notify the cardiology team immediately for further guidance and potential escalation of care. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation is crucial.",

        "correct": "Place the infant in the knee-chest position. Knee-chest position reduces venous return from the legs and increases systemic vascular resistance. This helps to decrease the right-to-left shunting of blood through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow and oxygen saturation. This should be the FIRST intervention as it is easily implemented, non-invasive, and has a rapid effect on improving oxygenation.",
        "incorrect": "Administer morphine sulfate IV: While morphine is an important adjunctive treatment to help calm the infant, reduce respiratory effort, and decrease metabolic demand, positioning is the immediate priority to address the physiological shunting. Morphine can be administered after initial positioning.\n\nApply oxygen via nasal cannula: While supplemental oxygen is crucial, it is less effective in significantly improving oxygen saturation during a Tet spell due to the persistent right-to-left shunting of blood. Addressing the shunt with positioning is the priority before maximizing oxygen delivery.\n\nPrepare for endotracheal intubation: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if the initial interventions are unsuccessful in resolving the hypercyanotic spell, but it is not the first-line intervention. More conservative and immediate measures, like positioning, should be attempted first.",
