BACKGROUND: Liam has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and is scheduled for surgical repair next week. At 10:15, his mother reported acute cyanosis during feeding. ASSESSMENT: At 10:20, HR is 180, RR 60 with increased work of breathing, SpO2 68% on room air. Physical exam: circumoral cyanosis and clubbing. Weight is 7 kg. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. He is irritable, pulling at his chest. Labs are pending. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate intervention for a hypercyanotic spell. Prioritize knee-chest positioning, morphine sulfate to calm the infant and reduce respiratory effort, and oxygen via face mask. Notify cardiology immediately for further guidance. Continuous monitoring of vitals and SpO2 is crucial.",

This action decreases right-to-left shunting through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), increasing pulmonary blood flow and oxygen saturation. It's easily implemented, non-invasive, and rapidly improves oxygenation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering morphine sulfate IV can help calm the infant, reduce respiratory effort, and decrease metabolic demand, but positioning addresses the physiological shunting first. Morphine follows initial positioning.\n\nApplying oxygen via nasal cannula is less effective during a Tet spell due to persistent right-to-left shunting. Addressing the shunt with positioning is the priority before maximizing oxygen delivery.\n\nEndotracheal intubation may be needed if initial interventions fail, but it's not first-line. Conservative measures like positioning should be attempted first.",
