B: His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He received tPA upon arrival to the emergency department. A: At 0700, Mr. Tyrell's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score decreased significantly from 14 to 9. He now presents with new left-sided weakness, unequal pupils with a dilated right pupil, and irregular breathing patterns. His 0715 vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 188/102 mmHg, heart rate 52 bpm, respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute, and SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Recent lab results are pending. R: I am highly concerned about a potential increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to cerebral edema. I strongly recommend an immediate neurological assessment by the neurosurgery team, consideration for intubation to protect the airway and optimize ventilation, and stat orders for mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce ICP. I also require guidance on blood pressure management, as I am cautious about rapidly decreasing his blood pressure given his recent stroke. I am paging neurosurgery STAT for urgent evaluation. The current time is 0720.",

        "correct": "Administering mannitol or hypertonic saline is crucial to reduce cerebral edema and ICP. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Hyperventilation (within controlled limits) can temporarily reduce PaCO2, causing vasoconstriction and decreasing cerebral blood flow, thus lowering ICP. Continuous neurological assessment is vital to monitor the patient's response to interventions and detect further deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) while the heart rate is already low (52 bpm) could cause further bradycardia and hypotension, potentially worsening cerebral perfusion. Increasing oxygen flow will improve the oxygen saturation, but the primary problem is not hypoxemia, but rather hypercapnia and increased ICP. Lowering the blood pressure too aggressively in the acute phase of a stroke can reduce cerebral perfusion and worsen the ischemic penumbra. The target BP should be based on provider orders. While Acetaminophen is appropriate for fever, it does not directly address the immediate neurological deterioration and increased ICP.",
