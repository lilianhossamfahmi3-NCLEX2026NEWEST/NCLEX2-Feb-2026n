A: On arrival, SGM Miller was alert and oriented to person, place, and time but expressed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. He stated, \"I'm tired of fighting; everyone would be better off without me.\" His wrist lacerations have been cleaned and bandaged. Vitals: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 98.8°F (37.1°C). He denies current suicidal ideation but admits to having passive suicidal thoughts for the past week.

SGM Miller has a recent history of a suicide attempt, expressed feelings of hopelessness, and admits to passive suicidal ideation. While other interventions are important, ensuring the patient's immediate safety is paramount. Constant monitoring allows for immediate intervention if SGM Miller's suicidal ideation escalates or if he attempts self-harm.",
        "incorrect": "A: Initiating a no-harm contract can be a useful tool in suicide prevention, but it is not the priority in this situation. The patient's immediate safety must be ensured first through continuous observation. A contract is a verbal agreement and does not replace direct observation when the risk is high. \nB: Administering sertraline is important for addressing the underlying depression, but it is not the immediate priority. Sertraline takes several weeks to reach therapeutic effect, and the patient's immediate safety is the primary concern. \nD: Group therapy can be beneficial for long-term support, but it is not the priority in the acute phase after a suicide attempt. The patient needs individual monitoring and support to ensure safety and stability before participating in group activities.",
