He reports severe abdominal pain, rated 8/10, despite receiving opioid analgesics. He also reports nausea. B: Patient has a history of cholelithiasis. Vital signs are stable, but his heart rate is elevated. He is NPO. O: At 07:00, the patient reports pain 8/10. Abdomen is distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. Labs are pending. Urine output has been low in the last 8 hours. A: Acute pancreatitis with poorly controlled pain and decreased urine output, indicating potential dehydration. Elevated amylase and lipase levels confirm pancreatic inflammation. Risk for further complications including fluid imbalance and infection. Plan: 07:15: Administer pain medication per order. Await lab results for further evaluation. 07:30: Contact the provider if pain remains unrelieved or if the patient's condition worsens. Monitor urine output closely. 08:00: Reassess pain level and perform abdominal assessment. Monitor vital signs and lab results.",

    "correct": "Initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is the most appropriate intervention. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis are often unable to tolerate enteral nutrition due to pancreatic inflammation and pain, which leads to increased pancreatic stimulation. TPN provides nutritional support while minimizing pancreatic stimulation, allowing the pancreas to rest and recover. The elevated amylase and lipase, coupled with persistent pain and NPO status, indicate the need for advanced nutritional support beyond IV fluids alone.",
    "incorrect": "Discontinuing opioid analgesics is inappropriate. The patient reports significant pain, and withholding pain medication would be unethical and detrimental to their comfort and recovery. While addressing the underlying cause of pain is important, pain management should be prioritized. The question asks for the MOST appropriate intervention, and TPN addresses both nutrition and indirectly assists with decreasing pain by resting the pancreas. The nurse can anticipate that opioid analgesics would be required until the pancreas has recovered.\n\nAdministering a bolus of IV fluids might seem reasonable given the potential for dehydration, but it does not address the underlying need for nutritional support and pancreatic rest. While hydration is important, TPN addresses a more critical need in this scenario.\n\nStarting enteral feedings via nasogastric tube is contraindicated in severe acute pancreatitis because it can stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion, exacerbating the inflammation and pain.",
