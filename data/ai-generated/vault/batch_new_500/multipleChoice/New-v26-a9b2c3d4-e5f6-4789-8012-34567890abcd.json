Currently on warfarin 5mg daily. ASSESSMENT: At 08:30, the patient reported increased pain and swelling in her left leg. Doppler ultrasound confirmed acute DVT. Her current INR is 1.2. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 94% on room air. The provider was notified and prescribed heparin IV infusion. RECOMMENDATION: Begin the prescribed heparin infusion at 1200 units/hour. Monitor aPTT levels every 6 hours. Assess the patient's leg for changes in pain, swelling, and circulation. Provide pain medication as needed. Watch for any signs of bleeding, including hematuria, melena, or bruising. Ensure the patient remains on bed rest with the affected leg elevated.",

Therefore, the nurse should set the infusion pump to 24 mL/hour. This ensures the patient receives the prescribed dose of heparin to prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers usually stem from misinterpreting the concentration, inverting the ratio, or making an arithmetic error. For example, selecting 10 mL/hour indicates the student likely divided 500 mL by 25,000 units to get the mL/unit ratio and then multiplied by 1200 units, which is incorrect. Choosing 48 mL/hour would indicate that the student doubled the correct infusion rate, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the dosage or calculation error.",
