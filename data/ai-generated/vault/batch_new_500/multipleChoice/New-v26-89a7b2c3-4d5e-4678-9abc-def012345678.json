    "sbar": "Situation: I'm calling about Maria Rodriguez, a 28-year-old G1P1 who delivered vaginally at 0100 today. Background: She had an uncomplicated pregnancy until 36 weeks when she developed mild preeclampsia. She received magnesium sulfate during labor, which was discontinued 1 hour postpartum. Assessment: At 0600, her BP was 160/100, HR 98, RR 18, Temp 99.2°F (37.3°C). Fundus is boggy and 2 cm above the umbilicus, shifted to the right. Lochia rubra is heavy with several large clots. She reports blurred vision and a headache. A Foley catheter is in place with 50 mL urine output in the last hour. She's alert and oriented but anxious. Recommendation: I'm concerned about postpartum hemorrhage and potential worsening of her preeclampsia. I've already performed fundal massage, but the uterus remains boggy. Could you provide further recommendations for managing her condition, considering the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and her elevated blood pressure?",

    "correct": "Administer the ordered methylergonovine 0.2 mg IM. Given the client's persistent boggy uterus despite fundal massage and the heavy lochia with clots, along with a history of preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage is a significant concern. Methylergonovine is an uterotonic medication that promotes uterine contractions, helping to control bleeding. Although the elevated blood pressure warrants careful monitoring, in this situation, controlling the hemorrhage is the priority to prevent further complications. Vital signs should be monitored closely after administration of methylergonovine.",
    "incorrect": "Administer acetaminophen 650 mg PO for headache: While the client reports a headache, addressing the potential postpartum hemorrhage is the priority to stabilize the patient. Acetaminophen will not address the underlying cause of the headache, which could be related to preeclampsia or fluid shifts. Addressing the hemorrhage is crucial before managing the headache.\n\nIncrease the oxytocin infusion rate: The oxytocin infusion is already running. While increasing it might seem logical, the fundus remains boggy, suggesting that further intervention with a different uterotonic agent is needed. Methylergonovine works through a different mechanism than oxytocin and may be more effective in this situation to contract the uterus and reduce bleeding.\n\nContact the healthcare provider to report the elevated blood pressure: While the elevated blood pressure is concerning and the provider has been contacted (SBAR indicates the nurse is calling for recommendations), directly addressing the postpartum hemorrhage is the immediate priority. The nurse should implement appropriate interventions based on the client's condition and standing orders to stabilize the patient.",
