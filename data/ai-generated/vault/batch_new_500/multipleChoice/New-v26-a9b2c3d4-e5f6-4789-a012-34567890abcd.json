Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr for the last 2 hours. Labs pending. 07:15: New order for blood cultures x2 and lactate level obtained. 07:20: Patient reports feeling dizzy. IV access patent in left forearm. Surgical wound site on abdomen (from prior appendectomy) with mild redness and purulent drainage noted. A: Possible septic shock secondary to healthcare-associated infection. Requires immediate intervention. Requesting urgent evaluation. Blood cultures sent to lab. New order for fluid bolus received.

The patient's blood pressure (90/50 mmHg), elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L), decreased urine output (20 mL/hr), and altered mental status are indicative of septic shock. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to improve perfusion, increase blood pressure, and prevent further organ damage. Addressing hypovolemia is paramount in managing septic shock.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen flow rate is important but secondary to fluid resuscitation. While the patient is hypoxic (SpO2 92%), improving perfusion with fluids will address the underlying issue and improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Cool compresses and antipyretics can help reduce fever, but fever management is not the immediate priority in septic shock. Addressing the hypotension and hypoperfusion is crucial first.",
