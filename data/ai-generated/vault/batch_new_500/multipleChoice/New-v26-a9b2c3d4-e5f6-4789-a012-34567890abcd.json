B: History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Initial UTI treated with oral ciprofloxacin. U: 07:15: Patient's current vital signs: Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C), HR 120 bpm, RR 28, BP 88/52 mmHg, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Labs show WBC 15,000/μL, Lactate 3.5 mmol/L. Urine culture pending, but patient is producing scant, dark, concentrated urine (30 mL/hr). A: Patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, and febrile, suggestive of sepsis secondary to possible antibiotic-resistant UTI. R: I recommend immediate initiation of IV fluids, obtaining blood cultures prior to administering broad-spectrum antibiotics (excluding penicillin derivatives), and escalation of care to the ICU for closer monitoring and potential vasopressor support.",

The patient presents with hypotension (88/52 mmHg), tachycardia (120 bpm), and elevated lactate (3.5 mmol/L), all indicative of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Rapid fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of initial sepsis management to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. While other interventions are also necessary, addressing the hypovolemia is the priority to stabilize the patient.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen addresses the fever but does not directly address the life-threatening hypotension and hypoperfusion associated with sepsis. Discontinuing ciprofloxacin may be necessary later based on culture results, but immediate hemodynamic stabilization takes precedence. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter will provide more accurate urine output monitoring, but it is not the priority in the initial management of sepsis. Fluid resuscitation comes first.",
