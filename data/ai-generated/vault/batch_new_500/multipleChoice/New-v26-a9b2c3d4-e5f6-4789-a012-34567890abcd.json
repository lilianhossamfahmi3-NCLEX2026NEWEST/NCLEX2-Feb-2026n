B: His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His initial NIHSS score upon admission was 8. At 0600 this morning, the patient was stable and resting comfortably. A: At 0730, the nurse contacted me with concerns. The patient is increasingly lethargic, now only responsive to painful stimuli. The right-sided weakness is more pronounced compared to earlier assessments. Upon examination, the left pupil is dilated to 6mm and has a sluggish response to light. The right pupil is 3mm and reactive. Current vitals are: BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 10 breaths per minute, and SpO2 is 92% on 2L NC. The last dose of aspirin 81mg PO was administered at 0600. P: I am requesting an immediate evaluation for possible increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and further management. A stat CT scan of the head has been ordered. I am particularly concerned about impending brain herniation given the rapid decline in neurological status and vital sign changes. Please expedite the CT and neurological consult.",

        "correct": "The patient's GCS is rapidly declining, respiratory rate is low (10 breaths/min), and SpO2 is suboptimal despite supplemental oxygen. This suggests impending respiratory failure secondary to increased ICP and potential brainstem compression. Immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary to secure the airway, maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and prevent further neurological deterioration and potential herniation. This is the priority intervention to support life.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is not the priority as the patient's respiratory and neurological status are acutely deteriorating. Increasing oxygen to 4L may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation with a RR of 10 and declining GCS. Lisinopril should be held due to the acute neurological changes and the already elevated blood pressure which may be compensatory. Furthermore, administering oral medications to a patient with a rapidly declining level of consciousness is contraindicated due to the risk of aspiration.",
