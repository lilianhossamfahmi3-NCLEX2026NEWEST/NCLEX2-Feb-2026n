        "correct": "The patient's ABGs (pH 7.25, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg) indicate acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Despite a non-rebreather mask, SpO2 is 88%, and respiratory rate is elevated. Declining mental status suggests worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient isn't responding to maximal oxygen therapy and requires mechanical ventilation to support gas exchange and prevent further deterioration. Intubation provides definitive airway control and allows positive pressure ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Clinical Pearl: Early intubation in ARDS can prevent further lung injury and improve outcomes.",
        "incorrect": {
            "optionA": "Increasing FiO2 to 100% via non-rebreather is unlikely to be effective, as the patient shows signs of respiratory failure despite maximal oxygen therapy. The underlying problem is likely alveolar dysfunction (ARDS) or severe V/Q mismatch, requiring mechanical ventilation. Question Trap: This option may seem logical, but it only addresses oxygen delivery, not the underlying ventilation issue.",
            "optionC": "While hypotension is present, the primary issue is respiratory failure. A fluid bolus may transiently improve blood pressure but won't address hypoxemia and hypercapnia and could worsen pulmonary edema if ARDS is present. Lung sounds should be assessed before administering fluids. Clinical Pearl: Fluid overload can exacerbate ARDS. Question Trap: Addresses a symptom (hypotension) but not the root cause (respiratory failure).",
            "optionD": "Prone positioning can improve oxygenation in some ARDS patients but isn't the priority in this acute situation. The patient requires immediate airway control and mechanical ventilation to stabilize his condition. Prone positioning can be considered after intubation and stabilization.
