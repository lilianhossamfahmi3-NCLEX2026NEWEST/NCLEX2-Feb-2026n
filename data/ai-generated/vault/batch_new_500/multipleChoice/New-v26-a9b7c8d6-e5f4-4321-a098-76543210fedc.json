The patient's vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea), lab values (low Hgb/Hct, elevated lactate), and clinical presentation (restlessness, decreased urine output, pallor, diaphoresis) strongly suggest hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss from the splenic laceration. Fluid resuscitation aims to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion, which is critical to prevent further organ damage and improve patient outcomes. The elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to poor perfusion.",

While nausea may be present, stabilizing the patient's blood pressure and perfusion is the priority. | Increasing the oxygen flow rate might marginally improve oxygen saturation, but it will not address the hypovolemia and impaired tissue perfusion. The patient needs volume replacement to improve oxygen delivery. The SpO2 of 92% on 2L NC is acceptable in this situation, making this choice a lower priority. | Preparing for a blood transfusion is a reasonable step, but it is not the immediate priority. Fluid resuscitation should be initiated first to stabilize the patient and improve perfusion.
