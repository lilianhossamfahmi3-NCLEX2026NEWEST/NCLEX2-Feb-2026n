EBL was estimated at 600 mL.\nA: Currently, patient reports a headache rated 6/10, blurred vision. Fundus is firm, 2 cm above the umbilicus, and slightly deviated to the right. Lochia rubra, moderate amount with small clots. Vital signs at 06:00: T 37.1°C, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, BP 162/98, SpO2 98% on room air. Urinary output since delivery is 150 mL. Pt voided 50 mL at 05:30.\nR: I am concerned about possible postpartum preeclampsia exacerbation and urinary retention.

Hypertension needs to be promptly addressed to prevent complications like stroke or seizures.

Accurate output measurement is important for assessing kidney function and fluid balance, especially in the context of preeclampsia.",

Encouraging ambulation is generally beneficial postpartum, but in this case, the patient's blurred vision and elevated blood pressure increase the risk of falls, making it unsafe without further assessment and stabilization. Continuing Magnesium Sulfate is not indicated as it was discontinued 2 hours prior and the patient is demonstrating signs of worsening hypertension, potentially masking symptoms.",
