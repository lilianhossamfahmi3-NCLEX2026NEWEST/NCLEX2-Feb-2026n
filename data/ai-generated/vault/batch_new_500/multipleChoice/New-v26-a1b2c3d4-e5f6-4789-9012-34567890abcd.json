Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, supported by peaked T waves on the EKG. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate lowers potassium by exchanging sodium for potassium ions in the intestine, promoting excretion in the stool. Given the severity, addressing hyperkalemia takes priority. \n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor for hypokalemia and sodium retention as potential side effects of sodium polystyrene sulfonate.",

Addressing the electrolyte imbalance is critical to prevent cardiac complications.\n\nElevating the head of the bed may improve oxygenation and comfort, but it does not address the life-threatening hyperkalemia. The SpO2 is 94% on room air, indicating adequate oxygenation currently.\n\nNotifying the provider about the change in mental status is important, but this has already been done per the SBAR. The nurse should independently act on the critical lab value (hyperkalemia) while awaiting further orders.",
