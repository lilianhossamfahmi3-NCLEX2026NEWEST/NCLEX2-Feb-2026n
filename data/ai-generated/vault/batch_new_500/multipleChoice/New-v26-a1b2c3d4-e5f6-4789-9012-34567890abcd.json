B: The patient was found confused at home by family at 06:00 this morning. His last known normal state was yesterday evening. He reports nausea. A: At 07:00, the patient is lethargic and only oriented to person. His blood pressure is 170/95 mmHg, heart rate is 98 bpm, respiratory rate is 24, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. Temperature is 37.2°C. EKG shows peaked T waves. Current medications include Lisinopril, Metformin, and Aspirin. Urine output has been scant over the last 2 hours, totaling 30mL. A: Possible hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on CKD, exacerbating confusion. R: STAT BMP and EKG were ordered. Nephrology was notified. Consider sodium polystyrene sulfonate administration. Reassess mental status frequently and monitor cardiac rhythm closely. Implement continuous cardiac monitoring. Initiate airborne precautions due to altered mental status of unknown origin.",

    "correct": "Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate is the most important intervention. The patient's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The peaked T waves on the EKG further support this. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate helps lower potassium levels by exchanging sodium ions for potassium ions in the intestine, promoting potassium excretion in the stool. Given the severity of the hyperkalemia, this takes priority.",
    "incorrect": "While monitoring urine output is important in patients with AKI and CKD, it is not the most immediate priority given the patient's hyperkalemia. Addressing the electrolyte imbalance is critical to prevent cardiac complications. \n\nElevating the head of the bed may improve oxygenation and comfort, but it does not address the life-threatening hyperkalemia. The SpO2 is 94% on room air, indicating adequate oxygenation currently. \n\nNotifying the provider about the change in mental status is important, but this has already been done per the SBAR. The nurse should independently act on the critical lab value (hyperkalemia) while awaiting further orders.",
