He has a 40-pack-year smoking history. \nAssessment: Alert and oriented x3. Temperature 101.5°F (38.6°C), HR 110/min, RR 24/min, BP 145/88 mmHg, SpO2 91% on 2L nasal cannula. Coarse crackles auscultated in the right lower lobe. Productive cough with yellow sputum. WBC count is 15,500/mm³.\nRecommendation: Initiate IV ceftriaxone and 0.9% sodium chloride per protocol.

Respiratory rate is 36/min and labored. Heart rate 120/min, BP 150/90 mmHg, SpO2 is 88% on 6L NC. Auscultation reveals diffuse bilateral crackles. An ABG obtained at 06:45 shows pH 7.28, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3 26 mEq/L. The client is alert but anxious, stating, \"I can't catch my breath.\"\nRecommendation: I am highly concerned about impending respiratory failure. Recommend immediate preparation for advanced respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or intubation, to correct severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

This is a life-threatening condition where the lungs cannot adequately remove carbon dioxide, leading to severe acidosis and hypoxemia. The priority action is to prepare for immediate advanced respiratory support (NIPPV or intubation) to restore adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Delaying this action to pursue less effective measures would be unsafe.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing the oxygen flow rate via nasal cannula will not correct the primary problem of hypercapnia (inadequate ventilation) and is insufficient for the degree of hypoxemia. Administering a nebulizer is not the priority, as the issue is ventilatory muscle fatigue, not primarily bronchospasm. Contacting the respiratory therapist is appropriate, but the nurse's independent priority is to prepare for the imminent life-saving intervention while awaiting the team.",

The combination of severe respiratory distress (RR 36, accessory muscle use), hypoxemia (PaO2 55), and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.28, PaCO2 60) indicates acute ventilatory failure. The only definitive treatment is mechanical ventilatory support. Preparing for this is the immediate life-saving priority.",
            "optionB": "Incorrect. A nasal cannula is a low-flow oxygen device and is already at its maximum effective flow rate (6L). It cannot correct the underlying problem of CO2 retention (hypercapnia). This action provides false reassurance and dangerously delays definitive treatment.",
            "optionC": "Incorrect. While the client has COPD, the primary problem is now ventilatory failure from muscle fatigue and parenchymal disease (pneumonia), not bronchospasm. A nebulizer treatment will not correct the severe gas exchange abnormalities and is not the priority intervention.",
            "optionD": "Incorrect. This is a 'pass the buck' distractor. While the respiratory therapist is a vital team member, the nurse must take immediate action to prepare for the necessary intervention.
