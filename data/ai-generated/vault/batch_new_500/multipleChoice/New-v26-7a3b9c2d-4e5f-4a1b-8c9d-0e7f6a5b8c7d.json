    "sbar": "Situation: Jameson Riley, a 68-year-old male, admitted 3 days ago for pneumonia, is now exhibiting increased respiratory distress. Background: Mr. Riley has a history of COPD and hypertension. He initially responded to antibiotics, but his condition has deteriorated in the past 12 hours. Assessment: At 07:00, the patient is restless and showing increased work of breathing, with an RR of 36, labored. His HR is 120, BP is 150/90, and SpO2 is 88% on 6L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. An ABG obtained at 06:45 shows pH 7.28, PaCO2 60, PaO2 55, and HCO3 26. The patient is on continuous cardiac monitoring and is alert but anxious. Recommendation: I am highly concerned about impending respiratory failure given his declining respiratory status and ABG results. I recommend immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation, including preparing for advanced respiratory support. Please assess promptly.",

    "correct": "The patient's ABG results (pH 7.28, PaCO2 60, PaO2 55) indicate acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, signifying respiratory failure. The increased respiratory rate and decreased SpO2 despite increased oxygen delivery suggest worsening ventilation and oxygenation. The MOST appropriate initial action is to prepare for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation to support ventilation and oxygenation. The rapid deterioration warrants immediate escalation of respiratory support before further interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing the oxygen flow rate via nasal cannula alone is unlikely to be sufficient given the patient's PaO2 of 55 mmHg and rising PaCO2. This intervention may delay necessary advanced respiratory support. While administering a PRN nebulizer treatment might provide some bronchodilation, it does not address the underlying issue of inadequate ventilation. Contacting the respiratory therapist is a reasonable action, but preparing for advanced airway management should occur concurrently. Assessing the patient's level of consciousness is important but secondary to addressing the immediate life-threatening respiratory compromise.",
