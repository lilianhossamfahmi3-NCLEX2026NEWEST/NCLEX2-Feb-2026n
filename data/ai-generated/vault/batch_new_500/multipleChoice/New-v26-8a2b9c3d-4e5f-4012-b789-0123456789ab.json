He is complaining of severe abdominal pain, rated 8/10. \nB: History of hypertension and alcohol use disorder. Admitted yesterday at 23:00 with elevated amylase and lipase. \nA: Currently, he is NPO, receiving IV fluids (Lactated Ringers at 100 mL/hr) and morphine 4mg IV q4hr PRN for pain. Vital signs at 06:00: BP 150/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 38.2°C (100.8°F). Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. \nR: I recommend assessing his fluid status, continuing pain management, and monitoring for complications. Consider the need for antibiotics if fever persists. The next morphine dose is due at 10:00, but I think he needs it now at 08:00.",
