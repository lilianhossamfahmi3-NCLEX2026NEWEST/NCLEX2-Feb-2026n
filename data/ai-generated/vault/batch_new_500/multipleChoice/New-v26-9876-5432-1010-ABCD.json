        "sbar": "SITUATION: Oliver Smith, a 6-month-old male diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), is currently experiencing a hypercyanotic spell characterized by increased cyanosis and respiratory distress. BACKGROUND: Oliver was admitted to the PICU at 07:00 today for observation following reports from his mother of increased cyanosis at home and poor feeding over the past 24 hours. He has a history of TOF and has experienced similar episodes previously. ASSESSMENT: At 14:00, Oliver's vital signs are concerning: SpO2 is 72%, heart rate is 180 bpm, and respiratory rate is 60 bpm. He is irritable and crying, indicating significant distress. Current orders include PRN morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg for hypercyanotic spells, prescribed at 07:30. The new RN is preparing to administer the morphine. Oliver's current weight is 7 kg. His CBC shows elevated WBC, Hgb and Hct, potentially indicative of chronic hypoxia. His ABG shows respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. RECOMMENDATION: The charge nurse needs to immediately assess the new RN's planned interventions and provide necessary guidance to ensure Oliver receives prompt and appropriate care during this critical hypercyanotic spell, focusing on rapid stabilization and minimizing potential complications related to TOF.",

        "correct": "Administering morphine via the subcutaneous route is inappropriate during a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell). The preferred route is intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) for faster absorption and effect. Subcutaneous absorption is slow and unreliable, especially in a compromised state like a 'tet spell' where peripheral perfusion may be diminished, delaying the drug's effect. Rapid intervention is crucial to break the cycle of hypoxemia and distress.",
        "incorrect": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position is a correct intervention to increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce right-to-left shunting, which subsequently improves pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation. Oxygen administration is a standard intervention to increase oxygen saturation, although its effectiveness might be limited due to the intracardiac shunting characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot. Preparing to administer the correct dose of morphine (0.7mg) after calculating based on the infant's weight is appropriate as morphine helps to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and relieve hyperpnea, contributing to improved oxygenation.",
