B: He has a history of COPD and hypertension. He has been receiving ceftriaxone for pneumonia and oxygen therapy. R: At 06:00, he exhibited increasing respiratory distress with SpO2 at 88% on 6L nasal cannula. He showed increased work of breathing, utilizing accessory muscles, and coarse crackles were auscultated bilaterally with a productive cough of thick, yellow sputum. At 06:15, he was placed on a non-rebreather mask at 15L. At 06:30, his SpO2 improved to 90%, but his RR is 34, HR is 120, and BP is 150/90. Arterial blood gas (ABG) was ordered. He appears anxious and restless. The physician was notified and further orders are anticipated. At 07:00, ABG results are pending, but his condition is worsening despite increased oxygen delivery, and lung compliance is decreasing. Based on current assessment, respiratory support is critical.",

The patient's ABG results (PaO2 55 mmHg, PaCO2 50 mmHg, pH 7.30) indicate acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Despite increased oxygen delivery, the patient is deteriorating, and mechanical ventilation is likely necessary to support gas exchange and prevent further respiratory compromise. This aligns with ARDS management guidelines.\n\nclinicalPearl: In ARDS, the lungs become stiff and less compliant, making it difficult for the patient to breathe effectively. Mechanical ventilation can provide the necessary support to improve oxygenation and ventilation.",

While the patient may have some fluid overload contributing to their respiratory distress, the primary problem is impaired gas exchange due to ARDS. Diuretics will not address the underlying alveolar dysfunction and may worsen hypovolemia, potentially leading to hypotension and further compromising oxygen delivery. Furosemide might be considered later, but is not the priority.\n\nclinicalPearl: Diuretics can be useful in managing fluid overload in ARDS patients, but they should be used cautiously and in conjunction with other therapies to address the underlying respiratory failure.",
