B: He has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation and is currently on warfarin, which was reversed with Vitamin K and Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC). The client had a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and a severe headache at home. A: His GCS is now 10 (E2, V3, M5). Pupils are equal and reactive, but sluggish. BP is 180/100 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, RR 24 and labored, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. The client is restless, moaning, and had an emesis of clear fluid at 07:30. O: I'm concerned about increasing ICP given his clinical presentation and recent emesis. Physician was notified at 07:45. I am requesting further orders for ICP management and blood pressure control. Current time is 08:00.",

The client's blood pressure is dangerously high and needs to be addressed, but hyperstimulation will make it worse. Clustering care increases ICP, so that is not the priority. Increasing the HOB increases venous return and decreases ICP. Therefore, the nurse should first dim the lights and reduce noise to minimize external stimuli and promote a calming environment.",

Clustering care is contraindicated in patients with increased ICP. Increasing the HOB to 30-degrees is important but not the priority over reducing external stimuli. Elevating the HOB is an important intervention that should be implemented shortly after reducing the stimuli.",
