Background: Mr. Miller has a history of COPD, hypertension, and a significant smoking history. He has been mechanically ventilated since admission due to acute respiratory failure secondary to his pneumonia. Assessment: At 0700 this morning, the patient is sedated with propofol, and he is currently tolerating the ventilator settings of FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, and Rate 16. His vital signs are: HR 92, BP 130/80, SpO2 96%. Lung auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. His sputum is thick and yellow in color. His WBC count is elevated at 14,000. He is currently receiving Vancomycin and Cefepime. Plan: We will continue the current ventilator settings, closely monitor his respiratory status, and review lab results as they become available. At 0900, the high-pressure alarm on the ventilator is sounding frequently. The patient's last suctioning was performed at 0600. His vital signs remain stable. The next dose of propofol is due at 1000. The nurse also notes an increase in the amount and thickness of the patient's secretions.",
