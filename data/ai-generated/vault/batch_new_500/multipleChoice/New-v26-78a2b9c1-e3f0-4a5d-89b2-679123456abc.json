His pre-op history includes hypertension and mild COPD. B: Admitted for CABG after experiencing unstable angina. Surgery was uncomplicated. He was extubated briefly yesterday but required reintubation due to increasing respiratory distress. A: At 06:00, his vital signs were stable. Current settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL, respiratory rate 14. At 07:30, the high-pressure alarm is sounding frequently. The patient appears increasingly agitated. His SpO2 has dropped from 98% to 91%. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side. ETCO2 is trending upward. O: Please assess and intervene as necessary. The current time is 07:45.",

        "correct": "Diminished breath sounds on the left side, coupled with increasing agitation, rising ETCO2, and a drop in SpO2, strongly suggests a pneumothorax. The high-pressure alarm further supports this, as a pneumothorax increases airway resistance. Immediate intervention is required to alleviate the pressure and prevent further respiratory compromise and potential cardiac arrest.",
        "incorrect": "While an elevated heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) may indicate pain or anxiety, they are secondary to the more critical finding of a potential pneumothorax. Addressing the respiratory distress is the priority. Increasing the propofol infusion rate could address agitation, but without addressing the underlying cause of respiratory distress, it is not the priority and could mask worsening condition. The ETCO2 is trending upward, but the change from 35 to 42 requires investigation and intervention, not just monitoring. This change, combined with other clinical signs (drop in SpO2 and diminished breath sounds), indicates acute respiratory distress.",
