        "correct": "Increase the IV fluid rate to at least 500 mL/hr and reassess blood pressure in 15 minutes. The patient exhibits signs of septic shock, including hypotension, elevated lactate, and decreased urine output. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to improve perfusion to vital organs and prevent further organ damage. The current IV fluid rate of 100 mL/hr is insufficient to address the patient's fluid deficit and life-threatening hypotension. Septic shock causes vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts from the intravascular space into the interstitial space. This results in decreased circulating volume and hypotension. Rapid administration of IV fluids helps to restore intravascular volume, increase cardiac output, and improve blood pressure. Reassessment of blood pressure after 15 minutes allows for evaluation of the patient's response to the intervention and guides further management.",
        "incorrect": "Administer Acetaminophen 650mg PO to reduce the fever. While fever management is important, addressing the patient's hypotension and signs of septic shock takes immediate precedence. Furthermore, the oral route is not the most effective due to the patient's lethargy and potentially compromised absorption due to decreased perfusion. In septic shock, the priority is to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status by addressing the underlying cause of the hypotension. Antipyretics can be administered later once the patient is more stable. The oral route is not ideal in this situation due to the patient's lethargy and potential for decreased absorption.",
