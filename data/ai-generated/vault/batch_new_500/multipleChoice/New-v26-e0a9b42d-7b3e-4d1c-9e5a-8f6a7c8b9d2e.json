Recommendation: Continuous observation and immediate consultation with the psychiatric provider for further evaluation and orders are needed.",

Given his expressed suicidal ideation, restlessness, and recent discontinuation of medication, he is at an elevated risk. Continuous observation allows for immediate intervention if his behavior escalates or he attempts self-harm. This action ensures the patient's safety and allows for ongoing assessment until further orders are obtained from the psychiatric provider.",
        "incorrect": "Administering lorazepam PRN without a thorough assessment of the current crisis and consultation with the provider may mask underlying issues and is not the most appropriate *initial* intervention. While lorazepam may be needed, safety is the first priority. \n\nContacting the patient's family without his consent violates patient confidentiality and might exacerbate his feelings of hopelessness and isolation. This action should only be taken with the patient's permission or if there is an immediate threat to the patient's safety or the safety of others.\n\nEncouraging the patient to participate in group therapy, while potentially beneficial in the long term, is not the priority when the patient is actively expressing suicidal ideation. The patient's immediate safety needs must be addressed first before introducing therapeutic interventions.",
