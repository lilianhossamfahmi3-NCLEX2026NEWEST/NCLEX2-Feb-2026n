Has been stable until this morning. \nA: Patient is now difficult to arouse, responding only to painful stimuli. Pupils are unequal, with the right pupil dilated and sluggishly reactive. Vital signs show a widening pulse pressure (BP 190/110 mmHg), bradycardia (HR 52/min), and decreased respiratory rate (10/min). SpO₂ has dropped to 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature is now 101.3°F (38.5°C). These findings are consistent with Cushing's triad, indicating a critical increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and impending brainstem herniation. \nR: Requesting immediate provider evaluation at the bedside.
