Received tPA upon arrival. A: At 0700, patient was alert and oriented x3. At 0830, patient is now exhibiting left-sided weakness, decreased level of consciousness (responds to painful stimuli only), and unequal pupils (right pupil dilated and sluggish). Vitals: BP 190/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 10, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Temperature is 38.5 C. Considering the sudden change in mental status, elevated temperature, and recent stroke, meningitis cannot be ruled out at this time. R: I am concerned about increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and the possibility of meningitis. Request immediate evaluation, STAT blood cultures, and orders to rule out infection and manage ICP. Consider lumbar puncture if no contraindications.",

Extubation is not indicated as the patient is not currently intubated. Attempting to increase oxygenation and decrease ICP should be the focus before resorting to intubation/ventilation. Furthermore, the patient may have increased secretions due to declining mental status and possible infection, so suctioning may be needed before intubation."
