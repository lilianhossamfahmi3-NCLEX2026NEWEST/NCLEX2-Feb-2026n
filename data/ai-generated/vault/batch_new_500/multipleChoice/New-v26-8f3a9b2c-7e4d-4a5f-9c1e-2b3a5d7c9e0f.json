B: Admitted at 06:00 for induction due to elevated blood pressure. Labetalol IV administered during labor. R: At 14:00, patient reports a severe headache and blurred vision. BP is 170/110 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air. Fundus is boggy and 2 cm above the umbilicus. Moderate lochia rubra with clots. Estimated blood loss is 400 mL. Patient is increasingly agitated and confused. Magnesium sulfate infusion was initiated per protocol at 14:15. Current rate 2 grams/hour. Urine output last hour was 20 mL. Deep tendon reflexes are +1. Report given to Dr. Smith at 14:20. Requesting immediate orders.",

    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of worsening preeclampsia, potentially progressing to eclampsia, complicated by postpartum hemorrhage. The elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred vision, altered mental status, and decreased urine output despite magnesium sulfate infusion indicate that the current treatment is insufficient. Furthermore, the low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes suggest HELLP syndrome. The boggy fundus and moderate lochia with clots indicate postpartum hemorrhage which could be exacerbated by HELLP syndrome. Administering hydralazine IV push is the most appropriate immediate action to rapidly lower the blood pressure and prevent further complications such as stroke or seizure. While other interventions are important, they are secondary to controlling the blood pressure in this critical situation.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing the magnesium sulfate infusion rate is incorrect because the patient is already receiving magnesium sulfate, and her deep tendon reflexes are already diminished (+1), indicating potential magnesium toxicity. Further increasing the rate without assessing magnesium levels could lead to respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. Administering methylergonovine IM is contraindicated in patients with hypertension and preeclampsia, as it can further elevate blood pressure and increase the risk of stroke. Preparing for a blood transfusion is important given the low hemoglobin and platelet count, but it does not address the immediate life-threatening hypertension and potential progression to eclampsia. Blood pressure control is the priority.",
