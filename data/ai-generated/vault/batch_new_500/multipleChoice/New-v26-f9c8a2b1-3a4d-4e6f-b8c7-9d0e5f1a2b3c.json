He has a history of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). B: Mr. Jackson received a 2-liter normal saline (NS) bolus over 2 hours. Labs drawn this morning show rising creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and he is now oliguric. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and insulin glargine. A: At 08:00, Mr. Jackson complained of muscle weakness and has developed an irregular heart rhythm on telemetry. His vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96% on room air. EKG shows peaked T waves. Urine output has been less than 20 mL/hr for the past 4 hours. O: I am concerned about potential electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function. I request orders for a stat electrolyte panel, including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate levels, and potential treatment options for hyperkalemia and AKI management. Please evaluate his current lisinopril dose considering his declining renal function and potential contribution to hyperkalemia.",

        "correct": "Hyperkalemia is the MOST likely electrolyte imbalance. The patient's reported muscle weakness, irregular heart rhythm (bradycardia with peaked T waves on EKG – although not explicitly provided, the SBAR hints it), oliguria, elevated creatinine and BUN, and a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L strongly suggest hyperkalemia. AKI is impairing the kidneys' ability to excrete potassium. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can also contribute to hyperkalemia by decreasing aldosterone production, further reducing potassium excretion. The rapid administration of normal saline may have exacerbated the hyperkalemia by diluting other electrolytes and relatively increasing potassium concentration.",
        "incorrect": "Hyponatremia is incorrect because the patient's sodium level is within normal limits (140 mEq/L). While hyponatremia can cause neurological symptoms, it doesn't align with the cardiac arrhythmias and elevated potassium.",
