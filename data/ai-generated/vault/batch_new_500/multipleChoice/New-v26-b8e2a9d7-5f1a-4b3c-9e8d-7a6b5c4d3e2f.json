Her fundus is boggy and located 2 cm above the umbilicus, deviated to the right. Lochia rubra is heavy with several small clots noted. Vital signs at 0630: BP 160/95, HR 98, RR 18, SpO2 97% on room air. She is currently receiving Oxytocin 20 units in 1000 mL Lactated Ringers IV at 125 mL/hr. The patient is alert and oriented x3, but seems anxious about her blood pressure. She voided 100 mL at 0500. No bowel movement yet.
