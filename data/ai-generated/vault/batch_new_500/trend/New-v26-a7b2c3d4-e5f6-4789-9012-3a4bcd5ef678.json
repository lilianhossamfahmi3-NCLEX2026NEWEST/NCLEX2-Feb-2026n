He initially presented with a productive cough and shortness of breath. R: This morning, the patient developed a fever and his cough worsened, producing purulent sputum. An initial dose of ceftriaxone was administered at 04:00. A: At 07:00, his vital signs were: Temp 102.5°F (39.2°C), HR 110 bpm, RR 28, BP 90/50 mmHg, and SpO2 91% on 2L NC. Labs were pending and urine output was 30 mL/hr. The patient was noted to be confused and restless. By 08:00, ceftriaxone administration was completed. Blood cultures returned positive for Gram-negative rods, WBC count was 18,000, and lactate level was 3.0 mmol/L. A: We suspect sepsis, possibly progressing to septic shock, given the patient's elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated lactate, and positive blood cultures. His blood pressure continues to decline. O: I anticipate orders for vasopressors to support blood pressure, repeat blood cultures to monitor the infection, and a potential change in antibiotic therapy to target the identified Gram-negative bacteria. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and mental status is essential. We should also consider transferring the patient to the ICU for closer observation and potential escalation of care.",

Increasing heart rate and respiratory rate are compensatory mechanisms for decreased oxygen delivery due to hypotension and possible acute respiratory distress.

The increasing temperature indicates the body's inflammatory response is continuing, even with antibiotic administration.",
