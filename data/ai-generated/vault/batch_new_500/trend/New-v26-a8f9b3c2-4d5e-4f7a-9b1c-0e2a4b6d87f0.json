Treated with IV antibiotics (vancomycin) for suspected MRSA prior to culture results.\nA: 07:00: Patient is increasingly lethargic, BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 32, SpO2 89% on 2L NC, Temp 38.9°C (102°F). Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr. New onset confusion noted at 06:30. WBC 18,000/µL. Lactate 4.2 mmol/L.\nR: Anticipate orders for fluid bolus, vasopressors, and repeat blood cultures. Patient requires close monitoring and potential transfer to ICU. Notify physician immediately of changes. Continue current antibiotic therapy and anticipate potential changes based on sensitivity reports. Monitor respiratory status closely and consider escalation of oxygen delivery.",
