Initial vent settings: FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Rate 14, Tidal Volume 450 mL. Arterial blood gas (ABG) at 07:00 revealed pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, and HCO3 24 mEq/L.\nA: At 08:30, the patient's SpO2 is 88%, and ETCO2 is trending up to 50 mmHg. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side. The patient is restless and appears to be fighting the ventilator. Vital signs at 08:30: HR 110 bpm, BP 150/90 mmHg, RR (vent) 14, Temp 37.5°C. Receiving a continuous IV infusion of propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min for sedation. The last dose of albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer was administered at 04:00.\nR: I am requesting orders for potential interventions to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and patient comfort. Please consider a chest X-ray to rule out a pneumothorax.",

        "correct": "Increasing the FiO2 is appropriate to address the patient's hypoxemia (PaO2 of 65 mmHg and SpO2 of 88%). The goal is to increase the PaO2 to an acceptable range (80-100 mmHg). Administering albuterol/ipratropium via nebulizer can help to open the airways and improve ventilation, addressing the elevated ETCO2 and diminished breath sounds. These medications are bronchodilators that relax the smooth muscles in the airways, reducing airway resistance. Assessing for a possible pneumothorax with a chest X-ray is crucial given the diminished breath sounds on the left and the increasing PIP, which could indicate a lung collapse. A pneumothorax can cause significant respiratory distress and requires immediate intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Decreasing the PEEP could worsen oxygenation by causing alveolar collapse. PEEP helps to keep the alveoli open, improving gas exchange. Decreasing it could lead to atelectasis and further hypoxemia. Increasing the propofol infusion rate without assessing the cause of the restlessness might mask underlying problems and increase the risk of hypotension. The patient's restlessness could be due to hypoxemia or pain, and these should be addressed first. Suctioning without assessing for secretions may cause trauma to the airway. While suctioning may be necessary, it should be guided by assessment findings. Paralytics should not be the first line of treatment. They can mask underlying problems and require careful monitoring and management.",
