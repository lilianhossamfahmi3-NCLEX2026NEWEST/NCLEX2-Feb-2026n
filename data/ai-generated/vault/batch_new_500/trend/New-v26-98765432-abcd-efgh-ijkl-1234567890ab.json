Initial vent settings: FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Rate 14, Tidal Volume 450 mL. ABG at 07:00 showed pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 65, HCO3 24.\nA: At 08:30, patient's SpO2 is 88%, ETCO2 trending up to 50 mmHg. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left. Patient is restless and appears to be fighting the ventilator. Vital signs at 08:30: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR (vent) 14, Temp 37.5°C. Receiving continuous IV infusion of propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min for sedation. Last dose of albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer was at 04:00.\nR: Requesting orders for potential interventions to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and patient comfort. Consider chest X-ray to rule out pneumothorax.",

    "correct": "Increasing the FiO2 is appropriate to address the patient's hypoxemia (PaO2 of 65 mmHg and SpO2 of 88%). Administering albuterol/ipratropium via nebulizer can help to open the airways and improve ventilation, addressing the elevated ETCO2 and diminished breath sounds. Finally, assessing for a possible pneumothorax with a chest X-ray is crucial given the diminished breath sounds on the left and the increasing PIP, which could indicate a lung collapse. The patient's restlessness could be due to pain, anxiety, or worsening respiratory status.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the PEEP could worsen oxygenation by causing alveolar collapse. Increasing the propofol infusion rate without assessing the cause of the restlessness might mask underlying problems and increase the risk of hypotension. Suctioning without assessing for secretions may cause trauma to the airway. Paralytics should not be the first line of treatment.",
