He presented with suicidal ideation following a recent job loss and the end of a significant relationship. B: Mr. Miller has a history of depression, diagnosed five years prior, and previously managed with sertraline. He discontinued the medication six months ago against medical advice. He denies any prior suicide attempts or hospitalizations for mental health issues. A: At 10:00, Mr. Miller expressed increasing feelings of hopelessness, stating, 'What's the point anymore?' He is tearful, withdrawn, and refusing to eat or engage in conversation. He exhibits noticeable psychomotor retardation. A current suicide risk assessment indicates a high risk for self-harm. His vital signs are currently stable: BP 120/80, HR 72, RR 16, and O2 Sat 98% on room air. The patient is currently on continuous observation, but his mental status is rapidly declining. R: I am requesting an immediate psychiatric evaluation to reassess his mental status and adjust his treatment plan, including potential medication adjustments or initiation of new therapies. I also recommend increased monitoring, implementation of suicide precautions, and consideration of crisis intervention strategies to ensure patient safety.",

    "correct": "Initiating one-on-one observation is crucial for maintaining patient safety when suicide risk is high.  Continuous monitoring allows for immediate intervention if the patient attempts self-harm. Notifying the psychiatrist for immediate evaluation allows for adjustment of the treatment plan, including medication and therapeutic interventions, based on the patient's deteriorating mental status. Removing potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment minimizes the risk of self-harm, creating a safer space. Documenting the patient's statements and behavior provides an accurate record for the healthcare team, facilitating communication and informed decision-making.",
    "incorrect": "Encouraging the patient to participate in group therapy might be beneficial later in the patient's recovery, but is not the priority when the patient is acutely suicidal and withdrawn. The patient is currently unable to participate meaningfully. Offering the patient a snack, while important for general well-being, does not address the immediate risk of suicide and may be refused given his current state. Contacting the patient's family might be considered, but is not the immediate priority in a crisis. Furthermore, it requires the patient's consent or a legal justification due to privacy regulations. Administering PRN haloperidol without assessing for agitation or psychosis is inappropriate and potentially harmful. The patient's primary issue is suicidal ideation and hopelessness, not agitation.",
