He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. \nA: At 07:00, the patient reports abdominal pain as 7/10. Vital signs are: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, and Temp 38.5°C. Lab results show elevated amylase (1500 U/L), lipase (2000 U/L), and total bilirubin (3.5 mg/dL). He's currently receiving continuous IV fluids (Lactated Ringers at 125 mL/hr), hydromorphone 2 mg IV q4h PRN for pain, and ondansetron 4 mg IV q6h PRN for nausea. Input and output are being monitored. At 08:00, assessment reveals abdominal distension and guarding.\nR: I recommend continuing pain management, closely monitoring for complications like hypovolemic shock and ARDS. We should consider escalating care if his condition worsens. A nutritional support consult and a social work referral for alcohol abuse counseling are also recommended.",
