        "correct": "1. Escalate concerns to the provider and mental health team. Rationale: Given the patient's increasing hopelessness, elevated vital signs, and refusal to eat, immediate escalation is crucial for reassessment and potential adjustment of the treatment plan. ClinicalPearl: Rapid changes in mental status, especially increased hopelessness, require immediate attention. 2. Reassess the patient's suicide risk factors and safety plan. Rationale: The patient's worsening mood necessitates a thorough reassessment of their suicide risk to identify any new or escalating risk factors. ClinicalPearl: Suicide risk assessment is a continuous process, not a one-time event. 3. Administer PRN medication (prazosin) if nightmares are reported. Rationale: Although not the highest priority, managing PTSD-related symptoms like nightmares can improve the patient's overall comfort and potentially reduce distress. ClinicalPearl: Addressing underlying PTSD symptoms can improve overall mental health. 4. Encourage the patient to participate in therapeutic activities. Rationale: Engaging the patient in activities, even if they express reluctance, can provide a distraction from negative thoughts and promote a sense of purpose. ClinicalPearl: Even small engagements in therapeutic activities can have a positive impact. 5. Document the patient's behavior, statements, and interventions. Rationale: Accurate and thorough documentation is essential for tracking the patient's progress, communicating with the healthcare team, and ensuring continuity of care. ClinicalPearl: Detailed documentation provides a clear picture of the patient's condition and the effectiveness of interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Offer breakfast again in 30 minutes. Rationale: While nutritional intake is important, the immediate concern is the patient's escalating suicide risk. Repeating the breakfast offer doesn't address the underlying issue. QuestionTrap: Nurses may focus on basic needs, overlooking the critical mental health crisis. HowToOvercome: Prioritize safety and mental health needs over routine care when a patient expresses suicidal ideation. / Review the patient's chart for family history of mental illness. Rationale: This information is helpful for long-term care planning but is not the most pressing concern in this acute situation. QuestionTrap: Focusing on historical data instead of the present crisis. HowToOvercome: Address the immediate threat to the patient's safety before delving into historical information. / Check the patient's room for contraband. Rationale: This is a standard suicide precaution but should already be in place as the patient is on level 1 observation; reassessment would be part of the risk reassessment. QuestionTrap: Assuming safety measures are sufficient without verifying their effectiveness. HowToOvercome: Always verify that safety measures are in place and effective, especially when a patient's condition worsens. / Contact the patient's family for support. Rationale: Family support can be beneficial, but the immediate priority is addressing the patient's current suicidal ideation and escalating symptoms. QuestionTrap: Deferring responsibility to external sources instead of taking immediate action. HowToOvercome: Prioritize direct intervention and assessment before involving external parties, unless immediate family notification is part of the safety plan. / Educate the patient on the benefits of medication adherence. Rationale: Patient education is important, but addressing the immediate crisis of suicidal ideation takes precedence. QuestionTrap: Focusing on long-term goals while ignoring the immediate crisis. HowToOvercome: Address the immediate crisis first, then focus on long-term goals like medication adherence.",
