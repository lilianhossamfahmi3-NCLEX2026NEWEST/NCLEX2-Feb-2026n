Rationale: Given the patient's increasing hopelessness, elevated vital signs, and refusal to eat, immediate escalation is crucial for reassessment and potential adjustment of the treatment plan. 2. Reassess the patient's suicide risk factors and safety plan. Rationale: The patient's worsening mood necessitates a thorough reassessment of their suicide risk to identify any new or escalating risk factors. 3. Administer PRN medication (prazosin) if nightmares are reported. Rationale: Although not the highest priority, managing PTSD-related symptoms like nightmares can improve the patient's overall comfort and potentially reduce distress. 4. Encourage the patient to participate in therapeutic activities. Rationale: Engaging the patient in activities, even if they express reluctance, can provide a distraction from negative thoughts and promote a sense of purpose. 5. Document the patient's behavior, statements, and interventions. Rationale: Accurate and thorough documentation is essential for tracking the patient's progress, communicating with the healthcare team, and ensuring continuity of care.",
        "incorrect": "Offer breakfast again in 30 minutes. Rationale: While nutritional intake is important, the immediate concern is the patient's escalating suicide risk. Repeating the breakfast offer doesn't address the underlying issue. / Review the patient's chart for family history of mental illness. Rationale: This information is helpful for long-term care planning but is not the most pressing concern in this acute situation. / Check the patient's room for contraband. Rationale: This is a standard suicide precaution but should already be in place as the patient is on level 1 observation; reassessment would be part of the risk reassessment. / Contact the patient's family for support. Rationale: Family support can be beneficial, but the immediate priority is addressing the patient's current suicidal ideation and escalating symptoms. / Educate the patient on the benefits of medication adherence. Rationale: Patient education is important, but addressing the immediate crisis of suicidal ideation takes precedence.",
