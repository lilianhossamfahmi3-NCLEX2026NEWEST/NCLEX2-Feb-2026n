B: His medical history includes hypertension, which is managed with lisinopril. The surgical procedure was reported as uneventful. A: At 07:15, the patient reported a sudden onset of dizziness and weakness. He was noted to be pale and diaphoretic. His current vital signs are: BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 28 breaths per minute, and SpO2 92% on room air. The dressing site has moderate serosanguinous drainage. Urine output since surgery is 50 mL. The patient is alert but anxious and reports pain level of 2/10 at the surgical site. R: I suspect hypovolemic shock secondary to possible blood loss. I am requesting an immediate assessment and orders for fluid resuscitation. STAT CBC and CMP have been ordered.",
