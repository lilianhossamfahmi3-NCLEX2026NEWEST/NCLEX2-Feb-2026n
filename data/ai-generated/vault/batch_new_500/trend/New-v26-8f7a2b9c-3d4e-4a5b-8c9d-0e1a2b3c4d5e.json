Bowel program initiated yesterday.\nA: Possible autonomic dysreflexia. BP is critically elevated. Heart rate is bradycardic. He is reporting severe headache and blurred vision. Assess for bladder distention and fecal impaction.

Failure to recognize the urgency of lowering the blood pressure and identifying the cause of the autonomic dysreflexia can lead to poor outcomes.
