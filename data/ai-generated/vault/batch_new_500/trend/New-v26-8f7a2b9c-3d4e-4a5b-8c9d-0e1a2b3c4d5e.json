He's flushed and diaphoretic above the injury level.\nB: Patient sustained a T6 spinal cord injury in a motor vehicle accident one week prior. No history of hypertension. A bowel program was initiated yesterday.\nA: Possible autonomic dysreflexia. Critically elevated BP and bradycardia are present. The patient reports a severe headache and blurred vision. Assess for bladder distention and fecal impaction. Administer PRN antihypertensive medication as prescribed.\nR: I recommend immediate intervention to address the elevated BP and identify the cause of autonomic dysreflexia. At 07:00, I called the MD and received new orders. At 07:05, I began implementing the orders.",
