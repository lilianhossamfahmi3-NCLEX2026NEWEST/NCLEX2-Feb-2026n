He reports a severe headache and feels flushed.\nB: Mr. Miller sustained the SCI six months ago in a motorcycle accident. He manages well but has had occasional UTIs. He's on scheduled baclofen and intermittent catheterization every 6 hours.\nA: At 07:00, his BP was 110/70 mmHg and HR 72 bpm. Now, at 07:30, his BP is 210/110 mmHg and HR is 50 bpm. He's diaphoretic above the injury level and has goosebumps below. I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. Last BM was two days ago. I elevated the head of the bed to 45 degrees.\nR: I request you evaluate him urgently for autonomic dysreflexia management. I'm prepared to administer nifedipine if ordered, after addressing potential triggers. Could you please provide further orders?",

        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. First, elevate the head of bed to at least 45 degrees to reduce blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Then, assess for and remove the triggering stimulus, beginning with the most common cause: bladder distension. Catheterize the patient to relieve any urinary retention. Monitor blood pressure closely during and after interventions. If BP remains elevated after addressing bladder issues, administer antihypertensive medication (nifedipine) as prescribed to lower blood pressure. Continuously reassess the patient's symptoms and BP to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying head elevation or addressing the potential trigger can lead to severe complications such as stroke or seizure due to uncontrolled hypertension. Administering medication before identifying and removing the cause may only temporarily mask the problem and not resolve the underlying issue, leading to rebound hypertension. Failing to reassess after each intervention prevents you from evaluating effectiveness and adjusting the plan of care, potentially missing persistent triggers or complications. Assuming the problem is resolved after the first intervention is dangerous, as autonomic dysreflexia can have multiple triggers or require further medical management.",
