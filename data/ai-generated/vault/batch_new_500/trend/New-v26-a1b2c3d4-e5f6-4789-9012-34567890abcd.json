B: Diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on elevated amylase and lipase levels. O: At 07:00, patient reports pain level of 8/10. Vital signs: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F). Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Last bowel movement was two days ago. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. Labs show elevated amylase and lipase, leukocytosis, and electrolyte imbalances. A: Hypovolemic shock secondary to acute pancreatitis. Risk for infection and electrolyte imbalance. I am concerned about his persistent hypotension and tachycardia. R: Continue to assess the patient, administer prescribed medications (pain and antiemetic), and closely monitor vital signs and urine output. Notify provider if BP remains low or urine output continues to decrease. Maintain NPO status and ensure IV fluids are infusing as prescribed.",
