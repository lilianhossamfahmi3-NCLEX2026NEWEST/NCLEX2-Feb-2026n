    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 52-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury, is experiencing a severe headache and elevated blood pressure, indicative of possible autonomic dysreflexia. Background: Mr. Smith was admitted 3 weeks ago for spinal cord injury rehabilitation. He typically manages well with intermittent catheterization. He has a pre-injury history of hypertension, which was well-controlled with medication prior to admission. Assessment: At 14:00, the patient reports a throbbing headache, rated 8/10. His blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm, and he is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of his injury. He reports feeling anxious. His last bowel movement was 3 days ago. Recommendation: Immediate assessment for autonomic dysreflexia is crucial. Check the patency of his indwelling urinary catheter, assess for bowel impaction, and administer the ordered PRN antihypertensive medication. Closely monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure. Notify the healthcare provider immediately if symptoms persist or worsen despite interventions.",

    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent severe complications. 1. Elevate the head of the bed to at least 45 degrees (or sit the patient upright) to help lower blood pressure through orthostatic effects. 2. Assess for and remove the noxious stimuli: Begin with checking for bladder distention by ensuring the indwelling catheter is patent and without kinks or obstructions. If the catheter is blocked, attempt to irrigate it gently. 3. Manually disimpact the bowel if bowel movement was more than 3 days ago, using anesthetic lubricant to avoid further irritation and carefully monitoring the patient's blood pressure during the procedure. 4. Administer ordered antihypertensive medication (Hydralazine) to reduce blood pressure if it remains dangerously high despite initial interventions. 5. Notify the healthcare provider to report the patient's condition, the interventions taken, and the patient's response, as further medical interventions may be necessary, including a more thorough evaluation for other potential causes and adjustments to medication.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying elevation of the head of the bed can lead to continued elevation of blood pressure and increased risk of stroke. Addressing the bowel impaction before ensuring catheter patency could delay relief of the immediate trigger, as bladder distention is a common cause of autonomic dysreflexia. Administering antihypertensives without removing the cause of the dysreflexia is a temporary fix and does not address the underlying problem. Delaying notification of the healthcare provider can result in delayed treatment and potentially life-threatening complications, especially if the initial interventions are not effective.",
