History includes hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\n\nO: At 07:00, the patient's temperature was 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate 110, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on room air. Urine appears cloudy with a strong odor. The provider was notified and ordered blood and urine cultures, IV fluids (Normal Saline 1000ml bolus), and antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 1g IV).\n\nA: The patient is exhibiting signs of sepsis, potentially progressing to septic shock, given the elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, and abnormal lab values (elevated WBC, lactate, creatinine, BUN, and procalcitonin).\n\nB: Continue monitoring vital signs, urine output, and level of consciousness closely, every 15-30 minutes. Administer ordered medications and fluids as prescribed. Re-evaluate patient response to interventions hourly. At 07:30, the patient became more lethargic, and blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mmHg. At 07:45, new onset confusion was noted, and urine output decreased to 10 mL/hr, indicating worsening kidney perfusion. The patient requires close observation and immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration.",

These findings indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction, requiring immediate intervention. The priority is to support blood pressure with IV fluids, administer oxygen to improve oxygen saturation, notify the provider of the changes, prepare for vasopressor administration if fluids are ineffective, and continue to monitor the patient closely. Timely intervention is critical in preventing septic shock and improving patient outcomes. The declining urine output and mental status changes are significant indicators of end-organ damage due to hypoperfusion.",

Notifying the provider without first stabilizing the patient, or focusing solely on temperature management without addressing the hypotension and hypoperfusion, are incorrect actions. Waiting for further deterioration before acting is also incorrect. Failing to recognize the significance of the decreasing urine output and mental status changes demonstrates a lack of understanding of sepsis progression and its impact on organ function.",
