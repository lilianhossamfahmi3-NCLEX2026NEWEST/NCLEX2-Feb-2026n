Current vent settings: FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 14. At 1430, he became agitated and tried to remove his ETT. Restraints were applied per the physician's order. At 1445, his respiratory rate increased, SpO2 slightly decreased, and peak inspiratory pressure increased. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV was given at 1450 for agitation. At 1455, diminished breath sounds were noted on the left side. Current vitals are stable except for the elevated respiratory rate. We are awaiting repeat ABG results. There is concern for complications related to ventilation or his underlying condition. Requesting immediate assessment and recommendations.",

An SpO2 of 89% indicates hypoxemia despite being on mechanical ventilation. A pH of 7.30 and PaCO2 of 50 mmHg indicate respiratory acidosis, suggesting inadequate ventilation. Diminished breath sounds on the left side may indicate a pneumothorax, atelectasis, or other lung collapse, potentially due to the mechanical ventilation. A PaO2 of 75 mmHg indicates hypoxemia.",

While the patient's history of pneumonia and the use of fentanyl are relevant, they do not directly indicate an acute problem requiring immediate action based on the provided data.
