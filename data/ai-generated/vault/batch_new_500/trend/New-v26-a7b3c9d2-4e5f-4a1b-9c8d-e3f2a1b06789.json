        "correct": "The aPTT at 11:00 is 65 seconds, which is above the therapeutic range of 50-88 seconds (assuming a target range of 1.5-2.5 times the control of 35 seconds). The heparin infusion rate should be decreased according to the hospital's heparin protocol. A typical protocol would suggest decreasing the infusion rate by 1-2 units/kg/hr for an aPTT in this range. The current rate is 1440 units/hr. Decreasing by 1 unit/kg/hr would reduce the rate by 80 units/hr (80 kg x 1 unit/kg/hr = 80 units/hr) and the new rate would be 1360 units/hr. Decreasing by 2 units/kg/hr would reduce the rate by 160 units/hr (80 kg x 2 unit/kg/hr = 160 units/hr) and the new rate would be 1280 units/hr. The nurse should document the rate adjustment and monitor the patient's aPTT regularly. Clinical Pearl: Always verify the hospital's specific heparin protocol.",
        "incorrect": "Maintaining the current rate would lead to an increased risk of bleeding due to supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Increasing the rate further would significantly increase the risk of bleeding. While vital signs are stable, they do not negate the need to adjust the heparin infusion based on the aPTT results. Delaying adjustment exposes the patient to unnecessary risk. Ignoring the lab values and focusing only on the patient's current stability overlooks the potential for future complications arising from inadequate anticoagulation.",
