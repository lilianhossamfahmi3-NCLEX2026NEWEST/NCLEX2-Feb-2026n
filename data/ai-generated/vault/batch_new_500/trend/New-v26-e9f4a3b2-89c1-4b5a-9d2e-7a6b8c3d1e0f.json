I'm calling about Samuel Ramirez, a 6-month-old male with Tetralogy of Fallot, scheduled for surgical repair tomorrow. B: Samuel was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for pre-operative assessment and stabilization. He has a history of cyanotic episodes, especially during feeding. O: At 07:00 today, his O2 saturation is 78% on room air. He is irritable and pulling at his IV site. Vital signs: HR 170, RR 52, Temp 37.8°C (100.0°F). Auscultation reveals a grade III/VI systolic murmur. Labs show Hgb 18.5 g/dL and Hct 55%. A: Samuel is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (“Tet spell”), likely triggered by pre-operative anxiety and agitation. The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit are consistent with chronic hypoxemia. P: I recommend administering morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV now, positioning him in a knee-chest position, increasing his IV fluids to 1.5 times maintenance, and obtaining an immediate repeat SpO2. Please provide orders to address the hypercyanotic spell and pre-operative anxiety. Also, ensure the surgical team is aware of this episode prior to surgery.",

        "correct": "Morphine sulfate is indicated to decrease respiratory effort and calm the infant, which reduces oxygen demand, thereby breaking the cycle of hyperventilation and hypoxemia. Knee-chest position is indicated to increase systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt and increasing pulmonary blood flow. Increasing IV fluids is indicated to increase preload and improve cardiac output, which helps to deliver more oxygen to the tissues. Monitoring O2 saturation is indicated to assess the effectiveness of interventions and guide further treatment. Preparing for immediate intubation is indicated as a proactive measure to secure the airway if the infant's respiratory status deteriorates despite initial interventions. A priority in Tetralogy of Fallot is to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and improve systemic vascular resistance.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker is contraindicated because beta-blockers decrease heart rate and contractility, which can worsen the infant's condition during a hypercyanotic spell by further reducing cardiac output. Administering furosemide is contraindicated because diuretics decrease preload, which can be detrimental in an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot already experiencing decreased pulmonary blood flow and increased right-to-left shunting. Supine position is contraindicated as it doesn't increase systemic vascular resistance as effectively as knee-chest, and it may compromise respiratory effort. Delaying intubation is contraindicated because rapid deterioration can occur in these patients, and timely airway management is crucial.",

            "howToOvercome": "Understand that in Tetralogy of Fallot, the primary goal is to increase pulmonary blood flow and systemic vascular resistance. Diuretics decrease preload and can exacerbate the right-to-left shunting, leading to increased cyanosis. Focus on interventions that increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce oxygen demand."
