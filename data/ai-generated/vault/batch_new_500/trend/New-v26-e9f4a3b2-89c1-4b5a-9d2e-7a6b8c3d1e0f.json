B: Samuel was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for pre-operative assessment and stabilization. He has a history of cyanotic episodes, especially during feeding. O: At 07:00, his O2 saturation is 78% on room air. He's irritable and pulling at his IV site. Vital signs: HR 170, RR 52, Temp 37.8°C (100.0°F). He has a grade III/VI systolic murmur. A: Samuel is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (“Tet spell”) likely triggered by agitation. Pre-operative anxiety is exacerbating his condition. P: I recommend administering morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV now, positioning him in a knee-chest position, and increasing his IV fluids to 1.5 times maintenance. Please provide orders to address the hypercyanotic spell and pre-operative anxiety. Also, ensure the surgical team is aware of this episode prior to surgery.",

Knee-chest position is indicated to increase systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt. Increasing IV fluids is indicated to increase preload and improve cardiac output. Monitoring O2 saturation is indicated to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Preparing for immediate intubation is indicated as a proactive measure to secure the airway if the infant's respiratory status deteriorates despite initial interventions. A priority in Tetralogy of Fallot is to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and improve systemic vascular resistance.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker is contraindicated because beta-blockers decrease heart rate and contractility, which can worsen the infant's condition during a hypercyanotic spell. Administering furosemide is contraindicated because diuretics decrease preload, which can be detrimental in an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot already experiencing decreased pulmonary blood flow. Supine position is contraindicated as it doesn't increase systemic vascular resistance as effectively as knee-chest. Delaying intubation is contraindicated because rapid deterioration can occur in these patients.",
