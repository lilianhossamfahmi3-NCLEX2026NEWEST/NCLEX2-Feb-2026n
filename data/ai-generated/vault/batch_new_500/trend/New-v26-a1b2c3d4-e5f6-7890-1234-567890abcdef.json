B: Patient has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He presented with left-sided weakness and slurred speech. Initial NIHSS score was 18. A: At 07:00, patient's GCS is 9 (E2, V2, M5). Right pupil is 3mm and reactive, left pupil is 5mm and sluggish. BP is 180/100 mmHg. Heart rate is 92 bpm, regular. Respiratory rate is 12 and shallow. Oxygen saturation is 94% on 2L nasal cannula. The physician was notified at 07:15. Current orders include mannitol 0.25 g/kg IV, continuous EEG monitoring, and frequent neurological assessments. His last dose of warfarin was 2 days ago. INR is elevated. R: I am concerned about increased ICP. I recommend repeating the CT scan and considering interventions to reduce ICP, such as elevating the head of the bed and adjusting the ventilator settings. I will continue to monitor closely.",

    "correct": "Maintaining the head of the bed (HOB) at 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering stool softeners prevents straining during bowel movements, which can increase ICP. Maintaining a calm environment reduces stimulation that can exacerbate ICP. Administering prescribed antihypertensives to control blood pressure is crucial, as hypertension can worsen cerebral edema and ICP. Hyperventilation, while sometimes used, is a critical intervention that requires precise control of PaCO2; it is not routinely indicated and can be harmful if PaCO2 is driven too low, causing cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia. Close neurological monitoring is vital for early detection of changes indicating worsening ICP.",
    "incorrect": "Lowering the head of the bed increases venous pressure in the brain, exacerbating ICP. Encouraging coughing can acutely raise ICP. Clustering nursing activities provides uninterrupted rest but involves multiple stimuli that can increase ICP. Administering hypotonic IV fluids (e.g., 0.45% NaCl) can cause fluid to shift into brain cells, increasing cerebral edema and ICP. Normal saline is acceptable, but must be cautiously administered to avoid fluid overload. Routine hyperventilation can cause cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia, which is detrimental to the patient. It is only used in specific, controlled circumstances.",
