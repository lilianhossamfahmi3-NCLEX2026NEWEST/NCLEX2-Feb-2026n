Current vent settings: FiO2 50%, TV 450 mL, RR 16, PEEP 5 cm H2O. \nB: History of COPD and hypertension. He was started on vancomycin and azithromycin. \nA: At 15:00, his SpO2 has dropped from 94% to 88%. End-tidal CO2 is trending upward. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 cm H2O to 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left. The patient appears increasingly agitated and is attempting to pull at the endotracheal tube. \nR: I'm concerned about possible pneumothorax or tube obstruction. I recommend stat chest x-ray and assessment for the need for increased sedation or paralysis.",

    "correct": "The decreasing SpO2, increasing EtCO2, elevated PIP, and diminished breath sounds suggest a serious respiratory compromise. Potential causes include pneumothorax, endotracheal tube obstruction (mucus plug, kinking), or worsening pneumonia. The patient's agitation may be due to hypoxia or discomfort. A stat chest x-ray is crucial to rule out pneumothorax. Suctioning the endotracheal tube is essential to clear any potential obstruction. Increasing sedation may be necessary to reduce the patient's anxiety and prevent self-extubation, but only after addressing the underlying respiratory issues. The ABG values confirm respiratory acidosis, further supporting the need for immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "While increasing the FiO2 might seem like a logical step to improve oxygenation, it's essential to first identify and address the underlying cause of the desaturation. Increasing FiO2 without addressing the primary issue could lead to oxygen toxicity. Paralysis should only be considered after other interventions have been attempted and the patient's agitation persists. While monitoring blood pressure is important, it's not the priority in this acute respiratory distress situation. Documenting the findings is always important, but immediate interventions take priority.",
