The patient’s wife found him unresponsive at home around 15:00. He has a history of depression, diagnosed 6 months ago but has not been consistent with therapy or medication management. At 16:15, the patient reported feeling hopeless and expressed passive suicidal ideation, stating, “I wish I could just disappear.” The patient denies current active plans, but his affect is flat, and he appears withdrawn. Vital signs at 16:30: BP 110/70, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 98.6°F (37°C). Acetaminophen level pending. The patient is currently on continuous cardiac monitoring. The provider has been notified. At 17:00, the patient is still exhibiting flat affect. The patient remains on suicide watch.",

    "correct": "1. Administer activated charcoal as prescribed STAT. Activated charcoal is a crucial intervention to minimize acetaminophen absorption in the gastrointestinal tract following an overdose. Given the recent ingestion and the pending acetaminophen level, rapid administration is essential to mitigate potential liver damage. 2. Implement continuous suicide precautions. Continuous monitoring is necessary due to the patient's expressed hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation. This involves maintaining constant visual observation to prevent self-harm. 3. Consult with the psychiatric team for evaluation. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential to assess the patient's mental state, determine the severity of the suicide risk, and develop an appropriate treatment plan. 4. Educate the patient about available mental health resources. Providing the patient with information about mental health resources, such as crisis hotlines, support groups, and outpatient therapy options, empowers them to seek help and support after discharge. This is a crucial step in preventing future suicide attempts.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying the administration of activated charcoal could result in increased acetaminophen absorption and potential liver damage. Discontinuing suicide precautions based on initial denial of active plans is dangerous due to the patient's expressed hopelessness and flat affect, which indicate a high risk for self-harm. Waiting for the acetaminophen level result before consulting with the psychiatric team delays the initiation of appropriate mental health treatment. Prioritizing education about mental health resources over immediate safety and treatment needs is inappropriate in this acute situation.",

      "Activated charcoal is most effective when administered within one hour of acetaminophen ingestion.",
