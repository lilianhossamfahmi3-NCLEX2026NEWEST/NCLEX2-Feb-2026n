He may have been exposed to RSV in the waiting room. BACKGROUND: Liam had a hypercyanotic spell three weeks ago, managed at home with knee-chest positioning and oxygen. He is scheduled for surgical repair next month. ASSESSMENT: At 07:00, his vital signs are: HR 180, RR 70, SpO2 78% on room air, Temp 37.5°C. He's irritable and has circumoral cyanosis. 07:15: SpO2 dropped to 70%. 07:30: SpO2 is now 65%, with increased work of breathing. 07:45: SpO2 at 60%, lethargic, and mottled skin noted. Parents are anxious. Hemoglobin 18 g/dL, Hematocrit 54%. Current medications: Propranolol 1 mg PO Q8H, PRN morphine sulfate available for IV administration. Given the potential RSV exposure, airborne precautions have been initiated. The care team is monitoring for any signs of respiratory infection or complications related to both the cardiac condition and potential viral exposure.",

    "correct": "The infant is experiencing a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell) evidenced by the rapidly decreasing SpO2, increased respiratory rate, and changes in level of consciousness. The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit indicate polycythemia, a compensatory response to chronic hypoxemia. The interventions of placing the infant in knee-chest position, administering oxygen, preparing to administer morphine sulfate, and notifying the provider are all appropriate. The elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, and decreasing oxygen saturation indicate decompensation and the need for immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the constellation of symptoms indicating a hypercyanotic spell can lead to delayed or inappropriate interventions. Normal WBC is not the priority at this time. Waiting to see if the SpO2 improves on its own risks further decompensation. While fluid bolus is appropriate if hypovolemia is suspected, it's not the immediate priority in a tet spell. Preparing for intubation may be needed if the spell doesn't resolve, but initial interventions should focus on reversing the hypercyanosis.",
