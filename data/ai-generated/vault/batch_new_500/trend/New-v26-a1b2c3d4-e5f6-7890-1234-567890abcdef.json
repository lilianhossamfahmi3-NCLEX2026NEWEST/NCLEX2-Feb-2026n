He reports taking 20 grams of acetaminophen over the past 24 hours due to chronic back pain. \nB: Patient has a history of chronic back pain and occasional alcohol use. No known liver disease prior to admission. \nA: Patient is currently lethargic but arousable to voice. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Skin is jaundiced. Currently on continuous cardiac monitoring. \nR: Labs are pending but initial acetaminophen level was highly elevated. Anticipate orders for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration. Monitor vital signs closely, assess neurological status frequently, and maintain strict intake and output. Be prepared for potential complications such as encephalopathy and bleeding. Notify provider of any significant changes. Last dose of NAC given at 11:00. Review updated labs stat.",

    "correct": "The elevated AST and ALT levels (2500 U/L and 3000 U/L, respectively) indicate significant hepatocellular damage, a direct result of the acetaminophen overdose. The appropriate intervention is to continue and potentially increase the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion, the antidote for acetaminophen toxicity. The elevated Total Bilirubin (8.0 mg/dL) indicates impaired bilirubin metabolism due to liver dysfunction. Monitoring for jaundice and pruritus is crucial. The elevated INR (2.5) suggests impaired synthesis of clotting factors by the liver, increasing the risk of bleeding. The appropriate intervention is to monitor for signs of bleeding and implement bleeding precautions. The elevated Ammonia level (150 mcg/dL) indicates impaired ammonia detoxification by the liver, leading to potential hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose administration helps reduce ammonia levels by promoting its excretion.",
    "incorrect": "While the patient's creatinine level is elevated (1.8 mg/dL), indicating possible renal impairment, it is not the most immediate concern compared to the liver dysfunction and associated complications. The primary focus should be on addressing the liver failure and its direct consequences. Treating nausea with ondansetron is appropriate but secondary to the other interventions. Increasing IV fluids may be warranted but only after addressing the priority issues of liver damage, bleeding risk, and ammonia levels. Monitoring vital signs is essential, but it is not an intervention in itself.",
