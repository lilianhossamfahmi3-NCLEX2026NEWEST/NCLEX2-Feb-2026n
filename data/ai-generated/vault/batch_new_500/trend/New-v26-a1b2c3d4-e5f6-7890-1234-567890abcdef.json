He recently returned from a 12-month deployment in a combat zone. He reports feeling isolated, hopeless, and experiencing flashbacks. He denies current intent or plan but admits to passive suicidal thoughts. The patient has a history of PTSD and mild depression, managed with sertraline 50mg daily prior to deployment, which he stopped taking two months ago due to perceived side effects. At 03:15, initial vital signs were: BP 140/90, HR 98, RR 22, SpO2 97% on room air, Temp 99.2°F (37.3°C). The patient is currently in a secure room under continuous observation. He is oriented to person, place, and time but appears anxious and withdrawn. At 04:00, the psychiatrist completed the initial assessment and ordered a safety contract and medication reconciliation.",
