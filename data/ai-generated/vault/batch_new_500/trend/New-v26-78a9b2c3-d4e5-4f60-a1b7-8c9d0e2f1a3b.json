Administering lorazepam can manage anxiety and agitation, contributing factors to suicidal ideation. Encouraging the patient to express feelings promotes therapeutic communication and allows for a deeper assessment of the patient's emotional state. Removing potentially harmful objects mitigates the immediate risk of suicide. Sertraline is a scheduled medication and should be administered as prescribed to maintain therapeutic levels.",

Delaying medication administration can exacerbate distress; medications should be administered as prescribed.",
