B: Mr. Miller has a five-year history of major depressive disorder. Recent stressors include job loss and a relationship breakup. He also has a documented history of prior suicide ideation. O: At 14:00, Mr. Miller expressed feelings of hopelessness, stating, 'What's the point of going on?' He is tearful and exhibiting psychomotor retardation. His vital signs are stable: BP 120/80, HR 72, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air. Acetaminophen levels are trending downwards, indicating the overdose is resolving physiologically. A: Mr. Miller is at high risk for suicide due to his current emotional state, recent stressors, and history. He requires close monitoring, therapeutic intervention, and immediate safety precautions. P: The plan of care includes continued suicide precautions, administration of scheduled medications as ordered, provision of supportive counseling and therapeutic communication, and a consult with the psychiatry team for further evaluation and potential adjustment of his medication regimen. We will also focus on creating a safe and supportive environment for Mr. Miller to express his feelings and work through his current crisis.",

    "correct": "Initiating one-on-one observation provides continuous monitoring to prevent self-harm, ensuring the patient's safety. Contacting the psychiatrist facilitates timely evaluation and potential adjustments to the treatment plan based on the patient's current condition. Administering lorazepam as prescribed can help manage anxiety and agitation, which are contributing factors to suicidal ideation. Encouraging the patient to express feelings promotes therapeutic communication, allows for a deeper assessment of the patient's emotional state, and can help the patient feel heard and understood. Removing potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment mitigates the immediate risk of suicide by limiting access to means of self-harm.",
    "incorrect": "Recommending group therapy might be a helpful intervention later in the patient's treatment, but it is not the priority in an acute suicidal crisis where immediate safety is paramount. Leaving the patient alone to rest is unsafe due to the high suicide risk and the need for continuous monitoring. Ignoring the patient's statements and hoping they will pass is negligent and potentially fatal; all expressions of suicidal ideation must be taken seriously and addressed. Documenting the patient's statements without further action is insufficient; documentation is important, but it must be accompanied by appropriate interventions. Delaying medication administration can exacerbate the patient's distress and potentially worsen their suicidal ideation; medications should be administered as prescribed and on time.",
