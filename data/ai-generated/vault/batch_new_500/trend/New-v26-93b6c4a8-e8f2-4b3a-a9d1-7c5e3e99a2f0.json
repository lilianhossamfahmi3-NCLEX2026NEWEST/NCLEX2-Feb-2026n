B: Patient was found diaphoretic and complaining of 8/10 chest pain at home. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. A: Received aspirin 325mg PO in the ED at 02:15. Currently on oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula. Pain is now 3/10 after morphine 4mg IV at 02:30. Vitals at 03:00: BP 90/50, HR 55 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96%. A new episode of chest pain occurred at 03:45, rated 7/10. Vitals at 04:00: BP 85/45, HR 52 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 95%. Labs indicate elevated Troponin I and BNP. R: I'm concerned about possible cardiogenic shock and symptomatic bradycardia. Requesting orders for further management of hypotension and chest pain.",

Atropine is indicated to increase heart rate and improve cardiac output in symptomatic bradycardia. A fluid bolus is contraindicated due to the elevated BNP, indicating heart failure, which could lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Initiating vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) is crucial to increase blood pressure and maintain organ perfusion. Holding metoprolol is appropriate due to the bradycardia and hypotension; administering it would further decrease heart rate and blood pressure, worsening the shock state. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess renal perfusion and the effectiveness of interventions.",

Holding metoprolol is necessary because it will further decrease heart rate and blood pressure, exacerbating the shock state.
