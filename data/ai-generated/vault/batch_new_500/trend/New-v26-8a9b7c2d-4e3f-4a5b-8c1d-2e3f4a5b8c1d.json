        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia, a medical emergency, presents with sudden, severe hypertension due to a noxious stimulus below the spinal cord injury level. The body's compensatory mechanisms are impaired, leading to uncontrolled sympathetic nervous system activity. Key interventions include elevating the head of the bed to promote orthostatic hypotension and reduce blood pressure, identifying and removing the triggering stimulus (e.g., bladder distention, bowel impaction), closely monitoring blood pressure, and administering antihypertensive medications as prescribed. Untreated autonomic dysreflexia can lead to stroke, seizure, or even death. The nurse's rapid and systematic approach is crucial for managing the patient's condition and preventing complications. \n\nclinicalPearl: Always consider autonomic dysreflexia in SCI patients above T6 presenting with hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis. \nquestionTrap: Do not focus solely on pain or anxiety; recognize the life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia symptoms. \nmnemonic: SIT UP (Sit UP patient, Identify/remove trigger, Treat BP, Usually bladder/bowel, Prevent with regular management).",
        "incorrect": "Ignoring the symptoms or focusing on non-critical interventions delays treatment and worsens the patient's condition. Administering pain medication alone does not address the underlying cause. Waiting for further orders without immediate interventions is inappropriate. Failure to address bladder distention or bowel impaction perpetuates the problem. Laying the patient flat exacerbates hypertension.",
