His baseline BP is around 110/70. He has been continent of bowel and bladder with a scheduled intermittent catheterization every 6 hours and a daily bowel program. Last catheterization was at 06:00, yielding 300 mL clear yellow urine. Bowel program is scheduled for 18:00.\nA: At 14:15, his BP is 190/110, and HR is 55. He is diaphoretic above the level of injury. I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. He denies bladder distention or fecal impaction but states he is having some lower abdominal cramping. The skin is intact around the catheter insertion site.\nR: I recommend immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia, including checking for bladder distention/kinking of the catheter, administering antihypertensive medication if BP remains elevated, and notifying the physician if symptoms persist or worsen.",

Assess for bladder distention or catheter obstruction, as bladder issues are a common cause of autonomic dysreflexia due to the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. 3. Loosen any tight clothing or constrictive devices to remove any external stimuli that may be contributing to the episode. 4. Administer hydralazine 10 mg IV PRN for SBP > 160. This is an antihypertensive medication to help lower the blood pressure quickly by causing vasodilation. 5. Continue to monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes and document findings to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",

Failing to address the underlying cause (e.g., bladder distention) will prevent resolution of the autonomic dysreflexia.

Not monitoring BP closely can lead to missing further escalation or lack of response to intervention.",
