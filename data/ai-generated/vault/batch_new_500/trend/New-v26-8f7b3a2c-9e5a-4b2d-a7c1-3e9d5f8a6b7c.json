At 0715, his BP was 180/100 mmHg, HR 52 bpm. The patient presents with a flushed face, nasal congestion, and reports a severe headache. He is diaphoretic above the level of injury. At 0720, the patient reports feeling anxious. His last bowel movement was yesterday. He has a Foley catheter in place, draining clear yellow urine. At 0725, the head of the bed was elevated to 90 degrees. At 0730, Dr. Lee was notified, and awaiting orders. The patient denies pain other than the headache. At 0735, checking for possible causes of irritation, focusing on the Foley catheter. At 0740, vital signs will continue to be closely monitored, and orders implemented as received. Autonomic dysreflexia is suspected, given his spinal cord injury level and symptoms.",

Elevating the head of the bed is the initial action to reduce blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Identifying and removing the cause of the irritation is crucial; common causes include bladder distension or bowel impaction. Checking the Foley catheter for kinks or obstruction addresses bladder distension. Administering antihypertensive medication is the next step if the blood pressure remains elevated after addressing the potential cause. Documenting the interventions and patient response is essential for ongoing care and communication.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rapid identification and management of autonomic dysreflexia are critical to prevent severe complications.",

Administering antihypertensive medication before identifying and addressing the underlying cause can mask the problem and potentially lead to rebound hypertension. Documenting is important, but not the priority in an emergency situation. Assessing bowel function is important but lower priority than immediate life-threatening symptoms. Administering pain medication is not indicated as the patient denies pain, except for the headache, which will not be resolved by standard analgesics.\n\nclinicalPearl: Untreated autonomic dysreflexia can lead to life-threatening complications, including hypertensive crisis and stroke.",
