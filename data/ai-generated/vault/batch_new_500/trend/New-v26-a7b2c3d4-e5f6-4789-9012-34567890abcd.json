He is currently in Airborne Isolation due to suspicion of a drug-resistant organism causing his pneumonia. O2 saturation is dropping despite increasing FiO2. Patient reports increased shortness of breath and fatigue. B: History of COPD and hypertension, managed with daily medications. Admitted for pneumonia; initial treatment with ceftriaxone started upon admission. Now showing signs of worsening respiratory distress, requiring escalating respiratory support. Recent sputum culture is pending but initial gram stain showed gram-negative rods. A: Respiratory failure secondary to probable ARDS and complicated by possible bacterial resistance. Increasing supplemental oxygen needs with minimal improvement. CXR shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. 07:00 assessment: SpO2 90% on FiO2 0.40, RR 28, HR 110, BP 140/90. ABG: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55, PaO2 65, HCO3 24. 08:00: FiO2 increased to 0.60, SpO2 88%. R: I recommend immediate assessment by respiratory therapy for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consult infectious disease for antibiotic stewardship given possible resistance. Consider proning and neuromuscular blockade if ventilation is initiated. Obtain repeat sputum culture and consider bronchoscopy if no improvement seen with current interventions.",
