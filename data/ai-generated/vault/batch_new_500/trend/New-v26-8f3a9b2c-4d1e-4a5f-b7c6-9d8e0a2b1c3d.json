Currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to increasing respiratory distress and declining oxygen saturation. Settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL, respiratory rate 16. \n\n1515: Patient became increasingly agitated, exhibiting signs of air hunger, requiring 2mg IV Versed for sedation. \n\n1530: Noticed increased airway pressure (peak inspiratory pressure rising from 25 to 35 cm H2O) and decreasing SpO2. Current SpO2 88%, HR 110, BP 150/90. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side of the chest. Chest X-ray ordered STAT to rule out pneumothorax or tube displacement. ABG drawn and pending. ET tube secured at 22 cm at the lip. Suctioned 20 mL thick, tan secretions. Physician notified of changes in condition and STAT respiratory therapy consult requested. Requires close monitoring and immediate intervention due to the rapid deterioration.",

    "correct": "Diminished breath sounds on the left, SpO2 of 85%, PaO2 of 60 mmHg, Increased airway pressure, pH of 7.25. Diminished breath sounds on one side could indicate a pneumothorax or ET tube displacement into the right main bronchus, either requiring immediate attention. An SpO2 of 85% and PaO2 of 60 mmHg indicate severe hypoxemia requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation, potentially including increasing FiO2 or PEEP. The low pH of 7.25 indicates respiratory acidosis requiring immediate correction of ventilation, likely by adjusting the ventilator settings to increase minute ventilation. Increased airway pressure is a sign of possible obstruction (secretions, kinked tubing), decreased lung compliance (pneumothorax, ARDS), or bronchospasm, and must be investigated and addressed immediately.",
    "incorrect": "Heart rate of 115, Temperature of 37.5 °C, WBC 15,000/µL, Patient agitation. While HR of 115 is elevated, it is within a compensatory range given the hypoxemia and acidosis, but should continue to be monitored. Temperature of 37.5°C is slightly elevated, but not an immediate threat compared to the other findings. WBC is elevated, indicating infection, but does not require immediate intervention relative to the acute respiratory compromise. Patient agitation has already been addressed (Versed) and is likely related to hypoxemia, but further assessment of pain or anxiety is warranted.",
