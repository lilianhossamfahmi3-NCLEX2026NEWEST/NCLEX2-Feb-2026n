At 07:00, the patient is increasingly agitated, diaphoretic, and febrile, with a temperature of 39.2°C. Blood glucose is trending upwards despite sliding scale insulin. She is on continuous cardiac monitoring. Her BP is 170/95 mmHg, HR is 140 bpm, RR is 28 and labored, and O2 saturation is 92% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient received scheduled levothyroxine at 06:00. Ms. Hayes was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 5 years ago and was compliant with medication until recently. Assessment indicates possible thyroid storm exacerbated by non-compliance. Recommendations include immediate intervention to stabilize vital signs and prevent further complications. STAT labs were drawn. Notify the attending physician immediately. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and mental status is essential. Assess for signs of heart failure. Consider beta-blockers to control heart rate. Prepare for possible transfer to a higher level of care. Anticipate orders for propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole.",

        "correct": "The patient's presentation – elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypertension, altered mental status, elevated free T3 and T4, suppressed TSH, and hyperglycemia – strongly suggests thyroid storm. The interventions aim to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis and release, block the effects of thyroid hormones on the body, control symptoms, and address precipitating factors. Administering PTU or methimazole blocks thyroid hormone synthesis. Administering beta-blockers like propranolol or esmolol helps control tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety by blocking the effects of thyroid hormones on beta-adrenergic receptors. Administering IV fluids addresses dehydration and supports cardiovascular function. Applying cooling blankets helps reduce fever and metabolic demands. Monitoring cardiac rhythm is crucial to detect and manage arrhythmias, a common complication of thyroid storm.\n\nclinicalPearl: Remember the '5 B's' of thyroid storm treatment: Block synthesis (PTU/methimazole), Block release (iodine), Block T4 to T3 conversion (PTU/propranolol), Beta-blockers (propranolol/esmolol), and Block enterohepatic circulation (cholestyramine).",
        "incorrect": "Failure to recognize the constellation of symptoms indicative of thyroid storm leads to incorrect intervention choices. Administering insulin alone is insufficient as the primary issue is not uncontrolled hyperglycemia but rather hyperthyroidism. Intubation and mechanical ventilation might be required later if respiratory distress worsens, but are not the initial interventions. Administering potassium addresses hypokalemia but does not address the underlying thyroid storm. Restricting fluids would be contraindicated given the patient's dehydration status.\n\nquestionTrap: The elevated glucose level might mislead you to think of DKA/HHS, especially with altered mental status. However, the key is the significantly elevated T3/T4 and suppressed TSH, pointing to thyroid storm. Always consider the complete clinical picture!",
