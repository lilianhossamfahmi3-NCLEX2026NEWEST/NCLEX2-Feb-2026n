    "sbar": "SBAR: Patient is David Thompson, a 72-year-old male admitted at 03:00 today with a confirmed acute ischemic stroke via CT scan. His initial NIHSS score was 14. Of note, his blood pressure has been trending upwards since admission. At 07:00, Mr. Thompson became increasingly lethargic. His respiratory rate is 10 and shallow, and his oxygen saturation is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. A neurological assessment at 07:15 revealed a decreased level of consciousness, unequal pupils (left dilated), and weakness on the right side of his body. Background: Mr. Thompson has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed with medications at home. Assessment: I am concerned about increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) given the acute changes. The patient is currently on continuous cardiac monitoring, strict I&O, and neuro checks every hour. Recommendation: I am requesting orders for a STAT neurology consult and consideration for transfer to the neuro ICU for closer monitoring and specialized care. I also recommend notifying the provider immediately about these significant changes in his status. I notified the provider at 07:20 of the change in status.",

    "correct": "The patient's declining neurological status, elevated blood pressure, and changes in vital signs strongly suggest increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) following an acute ischemic stroke. (1) Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask is crucial to maximize oxygenation and address the hypoxemia (SpO2 90%) that can exacerbate cerebral edema. (2) Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. (3) Contacting the physician immediately is necessary to report the significant neurological changes and obtain further orders, which may include STAT CT scan to assess for worsening edema or hemorrhage, and potentially mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce ICP.",
    "incorrect": "Administering Labetalol 10 mg IVP is less critical than addressing the hypoxemia and positioning the patient. While elevated BP is concerning, rapidly dropping the BP in an acute stroke can worsen cerebral perfusion. Suctioning the patient is not indicated unless there is evidence of airway obstruction or increased secretions; unnecessary suctioning can increase ICP. Increasing the IV fluid rate could worsen cerebral edema. Inserting a Foley catheter is not a priority in this acute situation; neurological status takes precedence.",
