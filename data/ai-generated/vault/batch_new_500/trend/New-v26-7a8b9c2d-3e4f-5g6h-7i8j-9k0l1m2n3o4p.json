Blood pressure has been trending upwards since admission.\n\nBackground: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with medications at home. At 07:00, Mr. Thompson became increasingly lethargic. Respiratory rate is 10 and shallow; oxygen saturation is 90% on 2L nasal cannula.\n\nAssessment: At 07:15, neurological assessment revealed a decreased level of consciousness, unequal pupils (left dilated), and right-sided weakness. Concerned about increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) given these acute changes. Currently on continuous cardiac monitoring, strict I&O, and neuro checks every hour.\n\nRecommendation: Requesting orders for a STAT neurology consult and consideration for transfer to the neuro ICU for closer monitoring and specialized care. Recommend notifying the provider immediately about these significant changes. Provider notified at 07:20.",

        "correct": "The patient's declining neurological status, elevated blood pressure, and changes in vital signs strongly suggest increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) following an acute ischemic stroke. (1) Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask is crucial to maximize oxygenation and address the hypoxemia (SpO2 90%) that can exacerbate cerebral edema. ClinicalPearl: Maintaining adequate oxygenation is paramount in patients with neurological compromise. (2) Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. ClinicalPearl: Proper positioning can significantly impact ICP. (3) Contacting the physician immediately is necessary to report the significant neurological changes and obtain further orders, which may include STAT CT scan to assess for worsening edema or hemorrhage, and potentially mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce ICP. ClinicalPearl: Timely communication with the healthcare provider is essential for prompt intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Administering Labetalol 10 mg IVP is less critical than addressing the hypoxemia and positioning the patient. While elevated BP is concerning, rapidly dropping the BP in an acute stroke can worsen cerebral perfusion. QuestionTrap: The trap is to focus solely on the elevated blood pressure and choose interventions to lower it without considering the underlying cause (increased ICP) and potential consequences of rapidly dropping the BP in a stroke patient. Suctioning the patient is not indicated unless there is evidence of airway obstruction or increased secretions; unnecessary suctioning can increase ICP. Increasing the IV fluid rate could worsen cerebral edema. Inserting a Foley catheter is not a priority in this acute situation; neurological status takes precedence.",
