B: His baseline medications include Lisinopril 10mg PO daily, Metoprolol 25mg PO BID, Digoxin 0.125mg PO daily, and Potassium Chloride 20mEq PO BID. O: At 06:00, the patient reported increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. His vital signs are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, and SpO2 90% on 2L NC. Labs show: Na 132 mEq/L, K 3.2 mEq/L, Cl 98 mEq/L, BUN 45 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.5 mg/dL, Glucose 180 mg/dL, Digoxin level 0.6 ng/mL. Weight is 80kg. A: The patient is experiencing a heart failure exacerbation with fluid overload, complicated by CKD and hypokalemia. The hypoxemia is concerning. R: At 06:15, the physician was notified and new orders were received: Furosemide 40mg IVP now, Lisinopril 10mg PO now, Metoprolol 25mg PO now, and Digoxin 0.125mg PO now. Continue current home medications. The patient is alert and oriented but distressed due to breathing difficulties. Droplet precautions are in place due to a recent respiratory infection.",

        "correct": "Furosemide is unsafe due to the patient's hypokalemia (K 3.2 mEq/L). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes potassium excretion, which can exacerbate hypokalemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, especially dangerous with concurrent Digoxin use. Lisinopril is unsafe because the patient's elevated creatinine (2.5 mg/dL) indicates impaired kidney function. ACE inhibitors like Lisinopril can further impair kidney function by reducing glomerular filtration. Metoprolol is safe because, despite the elevated heart rate, Metoprolol is indicated for heart failure to reduce cardiac workload. However, the physician should be notified of the elevated heart rate. Digoxin requires clarification because while the digoxin level (0.6 ng/mL) is within the therapeutic range (0.5-2 ng/mL), hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, even at therapeutic levels. The provider should be consulted before administration.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect responses indicate a failure to integrate the patient's electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, and medication profiles to determine medication safety. Failing to recognize the risks associated with administering furosemide with hypokalemia or lisinopril with elevated creatinine demonstrates a lack of understanding of medication safety principles and patient-specific considerations. Incorrectly assessing metoprolol or digoxin shows a misunderstanding of their indications, contraindications, and potential interactions.",
