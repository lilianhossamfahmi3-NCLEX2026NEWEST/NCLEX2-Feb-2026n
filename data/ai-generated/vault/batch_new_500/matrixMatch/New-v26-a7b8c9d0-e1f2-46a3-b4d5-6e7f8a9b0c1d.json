Metoprolol is a beta-blocker indicated in heart failure to reduce cardiac workload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and block the effects of excessive sympathetic stimulation.

While the client's digoxin level (0.6 ng/mL) is within the therapeutic range, hypokalemia (K+ 3.2 mEq/L) significantly increases myocardial sensitivity to digoxin. This potentiates the risk of digoxin toxicity (e.g., arrhythmias, visual disturbances) even at therapeutic serum levels. The nurse must contact the provider to address the hypokalemia before administering this medication."
