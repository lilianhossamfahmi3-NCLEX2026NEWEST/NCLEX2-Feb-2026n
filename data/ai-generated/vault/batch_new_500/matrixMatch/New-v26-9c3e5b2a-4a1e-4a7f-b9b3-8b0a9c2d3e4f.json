B: He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and a recent urinary tract infection treated with oral ciprofloxacin. O: At 07:00, his temperature was 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, and SpO2 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Pending labs show a WBC of 18,000/µL and Lactate of 4.0 mmol/L. Urine culture is positive for multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. A: Sepsis is suspected, secondary to MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI. Immediate intervention is required. 07:15: IV fluids were initiated per protocol. 07:30: The patient is becoming more lethargic, and blood pressure remains low, prompting consideration for vasopressors. He is on telemetry, showing sinus tachycardia. The family is at the bedside and anxious about his condition. His code status is full code.",

    "correct": "Administering a vasopressor (norepinephrine) is indicated to increase blood pressure in the setting of septic shock. Obtaining blood cultures helps identify the specific organism causing the infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically is crucial in sepsis management to cover potential pathogens before culture results are available. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is vital for assessing the client's response to interventions and detecting any deterioration. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess kidney function and fluid balance in the context of sepsis-induced kidney injury.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen alone is insufficient to address the underlying cause of sepsis. While acetaminophen may temporarily reduce fever, it does not treat the infection or hypotension. Delaying antibiotic administration increases the risk of mortality in sepsis. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible after obtaining cultures. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis, as adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Placing the client in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can worsen respiratory distress and does not effectively improve cardiac output.",
