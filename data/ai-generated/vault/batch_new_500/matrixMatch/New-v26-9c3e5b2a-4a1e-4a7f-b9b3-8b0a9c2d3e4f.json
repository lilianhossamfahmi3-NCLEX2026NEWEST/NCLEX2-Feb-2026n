        "correct": "Administering a vasopressor (norepinephrine) is indicated to increase blood pressure in the setting of septic shock by causing vasoconstriction and increasing systemic vascular resistance. Obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics helps identify the specific organism causing the infection, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically is crucial in sepsis management to cover potential pathogens before culture results are available, improving the chances of a positive outcome. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is vital for assessing the client's response to interventions, detecting any deterioration, and guiding further treatment. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess kidney function and fluid balance in the context of sepsis-induced kidney injury; decreased output may indicate worsening renal perfusion.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen alone is insufficient to address the underlying cause of sepsis, which involves infection and systemic inflammation. While acetaminophen may temporarily reduce fever, it does not treat the infection or hypotension. Delaying antibiotic administration increases the risk of mortality in sepsis because the uncontrolled infection can lead to further organ damage and failure. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible after obtaining cultures. Restricting fluids is contraindicated in sepsis, as adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion, counteracting the vasodilation and capillary leak associated with sepsis. Placing the client in Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended as it can worsen respiratory distress and does not effectively improve cardiac output; it may also increase intracranial pressure.",
