        "correct": "Digoxin is contraindicated due to an elevated digoxin level of 1.8 ng/mL, approaching toxic levels (generally >2.0 ng/mL). The patient also exhibits new-onset atrial fibrillation and confusion, indicative of digoxin toxicity. Furosemide is contraindicated as it can exacerbate existing hypokalemia (K: 3.4 mEq/L), increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Lisinopril is contraindicated due to the patient's elevated blood pressure (165/90 mmHg). Administering Lisinopril could further compromise blood pressure. Potassium Chloride is indicated to correct the patient's hypokalemia (K: 3.4 mEq/L), which can worsen cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Correcting hypokalemia is crucial for cardiac stability.",
        "incorrect": "Administering Digoxin with an elevated level can lead to severe toxicity, including life-threatening arrhythmias. Administering Furosemide without correcting the potassium level could worsen the hypokalemia, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Administering Lisinopril, when the blood pressure is already elevated, may not be the priority and the elevated BP needs to be addressed first. Holding Potassium Chloride with a low potassium level can lead to further complications related to hypokalemia, including arrhythmias and muscle weakness.",
