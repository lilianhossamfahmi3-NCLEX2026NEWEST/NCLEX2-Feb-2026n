Assessment: 0800 labs show elevated creatinine (3.5 mg/dL) and potassium (6.8 mEq/L). Urine output has decreased significantly over the last 24 hours, averaging 20 mL/hr. He's gained 3 kg since admission and reports increased fatigue and shortness of breath. Lung sounds reveal crackles bilaterally. Recommendation: He is currently on IV fluids at 75 mL/hr, antibiotics, and insulin per sliding scale. The provider was notified about the lab results and decreased urine output and ordered furosemide 40mg IV STAT and restricted potassium intake. Reviewing trends to differentiate AKI from CKD exacerbation. Patient denies any recent NSAID use. Last BM was two days ago. Consider further evaluation of his renal function and potential need for dialysis if the furosemide is ineffective. Continue to monitor vital signs and fluid balance closely.",

Decreased urine output (480 mL in 24 hours) suggests impaired renal function and fluid retention. Hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) is a common complication of both AKI and CKD due to impaired potassium excretion. Anemia (Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL) is more common in CKD due to decreased erythropoietin production but can also occur in AKI.",

Findings inconsistent with AKI include long-standing anemia and small kidney size on imaging (not provided in this scenario).

The presence of AKI superimposed on CKD is possible; however, this question focuses on differentiating standalone findings.",
