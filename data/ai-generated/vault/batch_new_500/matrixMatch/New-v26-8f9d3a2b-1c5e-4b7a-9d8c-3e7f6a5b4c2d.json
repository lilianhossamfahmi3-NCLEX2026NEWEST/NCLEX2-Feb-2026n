Assessment: At 08:00, lab results showed elevated creatinine (3.5 mg/dL) and potassium (6.8 mEq/L). Urine output has decreased significantly over the last 24 hours, averaging 20 mL/hr. He has gained 3 kg since admission and reports increased fatigue and shortness of breath. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally. Recommendation: He is currently receiving IV fluids at 75 mL/hr, antibiotics, and insulin per sliding scale. The provider was notified about the lab results and decreased urine output and prescribed furosemide 40mg IV STAT and restricted potassium intake. Reviewing trends to differentiate AKI from CKD exacerbation. Patient denies any recent NSAID use. Last bowel movement was two days ago. Consider further evaluation of his renal function and potential need for dialysis if the furosemide is ineffective. Continue to monitor vital signs and fluid balance closely.",

A GFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 is significantly reduced, indicating kidney damage and reduced clearance of waste products. Decreased urine output (480 mL in 24 hours) suggests impaired renal function and fluid retention, leading to oliguria. Hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) is a common complication of both AKI and CKD due to impaired potassium excretion by the kidneys. Anemia (Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL) is more common in CKD due to decreased erythropoietin production, but can also occur in AKI due to hemodilution or decreased production. Elevated BUN is due to the kidney's inability to filter urea from the blood.",

Findings inconsistent with AKI include long-standing anemia and small kidney size on imaging (not provided in this scenario). Findings less consistent with CKD alone, without acute decompensation, would include sudden drops in urine output or potassium spikes. The presence of AKI superimposed on CKD is possible; however, this question focuses on differentiating standalone findings.",
