Providing a safe and non-judgmental environment can help the patient feel understood and supported. Ensuring the patient's safety is paramount, and immediate action should be taken if the patient expresses an intent to harm themselves. Administering prescribed medication as ordered can help manage anxiety and agitation, reducing the immediate risk of self-harm. Consulting with a mental health professional allows for a comprehensive assessment and the development of a tailored treatment plan.",

Leaving a patient alone when they express suicidal ideation can be dangerous, as they may act on their impulses. Delaying medication administration or failing to consult with a mental health professional can prolong the patient's distress and increase the risk of self-harm. Focusing solely on the immediate crisis without addressing the underlying issues can lead to recurrent episodes of suicidal ideation.",
