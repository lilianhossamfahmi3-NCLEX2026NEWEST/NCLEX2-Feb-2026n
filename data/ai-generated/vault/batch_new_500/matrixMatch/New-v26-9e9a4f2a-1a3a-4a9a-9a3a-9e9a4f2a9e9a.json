He initially showed improvement in left-sided weakness but has declined significantly over the last hour. A: At 07:00, the patient became increasingly lethargic. His GCS score has dropped from 14 to 9. The right pupil is now sluggishly reactive, and the left pupil remains 3mm and reactive. BP is 190/110, HR is 52, and RR is 10 with shallow breathing. O2 sat is 90% on 2L nasal cannula. Family at bedside is increasingly concerned. I administered 4mg of ondansetron IV at 07:15 for nausea reported by the patient. Labs and vitals are available in the EHR. A: I suspect increased ICP secondary to edema from the stroke. R: I recommend a STAT neuro consult, possible transfer to CT, and orders for mannitol or hypertonic saline. Possible intubation may be needed.",

        "correct": "Administering mannitol is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Administering oxygen is indicated to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further hypoxia, which can exacerbate brain injury. Hypertonic saline is indicated to reduce cerebral edema and ICP by creating an osmotic gradient that pulls fluid out of the brain tissue. Initiating seizure precautions is indicated as increased ICP can increase the risk of seizures due to increased neuronal excitability.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a hypotonic solution is contraindicated as it can worsen cerebral edema by causing fluid to shift into brain cells due to the lower osmolality of the solution compared to the brain tissue. Lowering the head of the bed is contraindicated, as it increases ICP by impeding venous drainage from the brain. Fluid bolus administration is generally contraindicated in patients with increased ICP unless they are also hypotensive due to other causes, as it can exacerbate cerebral edema by increasing intravascular volume and pressure. Encouraging coughing is contraindicated as it can transiently increase ICP due to the Valsalva maneuver.",
