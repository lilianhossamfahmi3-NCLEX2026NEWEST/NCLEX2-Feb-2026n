Client reports living alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, which sometimes complicates his ability to attend follow-up appointments. A: On admission, vital signs stable. Sacral wound measures 2x3 cm, pink wound bed, no signs of infection. Neurological exam consistent with T6 paraplegia. R: Admit to medical-surgical unit. Consult wound care.

Last bowel movement was yesterday evening. A: At 07:00, BP was 120/80 mmHg, HR 72. At 09:00, his BP is now 210/110 mmHg with a heart rate of 50 bpm. He is diaphoretic and flushed above the T6 level, with cool, pale skin below. He appears anxious and is complaining of nasal stuffiness. The indwelling urinary catheter, placed an hour ago for convenience, appears patent and is draining clear yellow urine. R: Immediate intervention is required. I will elevate the head of the bed, perform a rapid assessment to find the noxious stimulus, and prepare to administer PRN hydralazine for SBP > 180 mmHg as ordered."

                "content": "This is the first and most crucial nursing action. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension, promoting venous pooling in the lower extremities. This reduces venous return to the heart, decreases cardiac output, and helps lower blood pressure immediately while the nurse searches for the cause."

                "content": "The client is already experiencing significant bradycardia (HR 50 bpm), which is a classic sign of AD. The hypertension triggers a baroreceptor reflex, causing a vagal response that slows the heart rate. Administering a beta-blocker like metoprolol would worsen the bradycardia, potentially leading to dangerously low cardiac output and cardiovascular collapse."

                "content": "The most common cause of AD (up to 85% of cases) is bladder-related issues. Even if a catheter is present, it could be kinked, clogged, or malpositioned. A rapid assessment for bladder distention and ensuring catheter patency is a high-priority action to identify and remove the noxious stimulus, which is the definitive treatment."

                "content": "The client's systolic blood pressure is 210 mmHg, which is dangerously high and places them at risk for stroke. The standing order for hydralazine for SBP > 180 mmHg should be implemented promptly after elevating the head of the bed. Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator that will help lower the blood pressure while the underlying cause is being addressed."

                "content": "This position would dramatically increase venous return to the heart and raise intracranial pressure, severely exacerbating the hypertensive crisis. It is the opposite of the indicated intervention and would be extremely dangerous for this client."
