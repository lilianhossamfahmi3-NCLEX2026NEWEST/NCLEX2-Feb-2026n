His BP is elevated and he reports a severe headache. B: Mr. Smith has a history of T6 SCI from a motor vehicle accident two years ago, resulting in chronic neurogenic bowel and bladder. He typically self-catheterizes every 4 hours. A: At 07:00, his BP was 120/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm. At 09:00, his BP is 210/110 mmHg, HR 50 bpm. He reports a pounding headache, blurred vision, and nasal congestion. Assessment reveals flushed skin above the level of injury and pallor below. The urinary catheter is patent. Last bowel movement was yesterday. Assess: The patient is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia, likely triggered by a bowel or bladder issue. R: I recommend immediate assessment to identify the trigger, administer hydralazine 10mg IV PRN as prescribed per MAR for SBP > 180 mmHg, and continue close monitoring of vital signs every 15 minutes.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed helps lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling in the lower extremities, reducing venous return to the heart. Assessing for bowel impaction is crucial as it is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia due to visceral distension. Administering antihypertensive medication (hydralazine) as prescribed is essential to lower the dangerously high blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage. Removing constrictive clothing, such as tight socks or abdominal binders, can help improve circulation and reduce external pressure that may be contributing to the hypertensive episode. Checking for bladder distension, even with a patent catheter, is important as the catheter may not be draining effectively due to kinks, sediment, or bladder spasms, all of which can trigger autonomic dysreflexia.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker is contraindicated as it can worsen bradycardia, which is already present due to the autonomic dysreflexia; beta-blockers can further reduce heart rate and cardiac output. Lowering the head of the bed would increase blood pressure further, exacerbating the hypertensive crisis by increasing venous return. Placing the patient in Trendelenburg position would significantly increase blood pressure and is absolutely contraindicated due to the increased venous return to the heart. Encouraging deep breathing exercises is not the priority in this acute situation as it does not directly address the hypertension or the underlying trigger. Massaging the legs is contraindicated as it could potentially dislodge a clot (especially if the patient has decreased mobility) and increase venous return, further raising blood pressure.",
