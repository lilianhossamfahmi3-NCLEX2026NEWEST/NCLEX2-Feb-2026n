Parents report increased fatigue and difficulty keeping up with peers. B: Diagnosed with TOF at 3 months. Had Blalock-Taussig shunt placed at 6 months. Scheduled for complete repair at age 3 but surgery was postponed due to recurrent respiratory infections. A: Currently experiencing a 'Tet spell'. RR 36, HR 140, BP 90/60. Cyanotic. Increased work of breathing. Temp 37.2°C. Administered morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV at 07:15. R: Please evaluate and implement orders for management of hypercyanotic spell. Monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation continuously. Consider escalating oxygen support if needed. Notify cardiology if no improvement in oxygen saturation within 15 minutes.",

    "correct": "<b>Increased Hemoglobin/Hematocrit:</b> Chronic hypoxemia stimulates erythropoietin production, leading to polycythemia to compensate for low oxygen levels. <b>Decreased PaO2:</b> Right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood bypasses the lungs, causing a lower partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. <b>Cyanosis:</b> Deoxygenated hemoglobin in the arterial circulation leads to a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. <b>Tachypnea:</b> The body attempts to compensate for the low oxygen saturation by increasing the respiratory rate.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrectly associating findings to processes indicates a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot and the body's compensatory mechanisms during a hypercyanotic spell. For example, attributing increased hemoglobin to increased pulmonary blood flow would be incorrect because TOF involves decreased pulmonary blood flow due to pulmonary stenosis. Confusing tachypnea with improved oxygenation would also be an error.",
