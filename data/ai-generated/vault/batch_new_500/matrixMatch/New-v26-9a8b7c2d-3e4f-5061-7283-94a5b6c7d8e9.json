Teaching relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing) is a non-pharmacological intervention that empowers the client with a self-management skill. Incorrect: While continuous observation is in place for suicide risk, it does not directly treat the physiological symptoms of anxiety. Identifying coping mechanisms is a higher-level cognitive process that is difficult for a client in a state of acute anxiety to engage in."

Encouraging the expression of feelings (therapeutic communication) helps the client process emotions and reduces feelings of isolation. Assisting in identifying new, healthier coping mechanisms is a foundational step in building resilience and preventing future crises. Incorrect: Administering medication addresses acute symptoms (anxiety) but not the root coping deficit. Removing harmful objects is a safety measure for suicide risk, not a therapeutic intervention for coping."
