Blood pressure is 158/92, heart rate is 122. The patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. O: Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. A: Patient is worsening despite antibiotics and supportive care. Arterial blood gas results: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58, HCO3 24. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. B: Transferred from med-surg at 06:00 due to increasing respiratory distress and declining oxygen saturation. The physician was notified immediately. R: Requesting orders for immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. Consider prone positioning to improve oxygenation. Monitor arterial blood gases closely following any interventions. Please initiate airborne precautions. Current time is 07:15.",

Prone positioning is indicated to improve oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation. Increasing the FiO2 is indicated, however, the patient is already on 6L nasal cannula, which is the maximum. Therefore, mechanical ventilation is needed to deliver higher concentrations of oxygen. Administering a bolus of intravenous fluids is contraindicated, as it can worsen pulmonary edema in ARDS.
