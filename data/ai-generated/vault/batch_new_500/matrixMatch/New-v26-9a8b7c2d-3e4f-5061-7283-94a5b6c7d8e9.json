    "sbar": "S: Jordan Smith, a 28-year-old male, was admitted to the medical unit at 02:00 this morning following a suicide attempt involving an acetaminophen overdose. He was found by his roommate. The patient has a known history of major depressive disorder and has been non-compliant with his prescribed medication regimen. R: The patient experienced a recent job loss and a relationship breakup, contributing to his current mental state. He has a history of previous suicide attempts. A: At 08:00, Jordan expressed feelings of hopelessness and voiced active suicidal ideation, specifically mentioning a plan to hang himself in the bathroom. He presents as restless, pacing frequently, and is visibly tearful. He denies experiencing any current physical distress from the acetaminophen overdose. His vital signs are stable, as indicated in the vitals tab. The patient is currently on continuous cardiac monitoring due to the overdose. O: Immediate nursing interventions include implementing suicide precautions, ensuring constant direct observation, removing any potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment, and promptly notifying the attending psychiatrist for further evaluation and management. A consult with the social worker has been placed to assist with resource planning and discharge planning. The medical team is aware of the acetaminophen overdose, but based on lab values it does not appear to require immediate medical intervention.",

    "correct": "For Risk for Suicide, removing potentially harmful objects from the patient's environment and maintaining continuous observation are essential interventions to ensure the patient's safety and prevent self-harm. For Anxiety, administering prescribed anti-anxiety medication, as ordered by the physician, helps to alleviate the physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Teaching relaxation techniques provides the patient with tools to manage anxiety independently and promote a sense of control. For Ineffective Coping, encouraging the patient to express feelings and concerns allows for validation and exploration of underlying issues contributing to their distress. Assisting the patient in identifying coping mechanisms facilitates the development of healthier emotional regulation and problem-solving skills, promoting long-term resilience.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections do not directly address the immediate safety concerns or the underlying psychological distress associated with each diagnosis. For example, while encouraging the patient to express feelings is a valuable therapeutic intervention, it is not the primary intervention for a patient at immediate risk of suicide. Similarly, while assisting with coping mechanisms is beneficial for long-term mental health, it does not address the immediate anxiety or suicidal ideation. Focusing on interventions that provide immediate relief and safety is paramount in this scenario.",

      "Imminent suicide risk requires immediate implementation of safety measures, including removal of hazards from the environment and continuous observation by staff.",
