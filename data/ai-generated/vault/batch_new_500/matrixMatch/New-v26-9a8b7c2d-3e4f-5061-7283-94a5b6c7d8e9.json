These actions directly mitigate the immediate threat. For Anxiety, administering prescribed anti-anxiety medication (as ordered) alleviates physiological and psychological symptoms. Teaching relaxation techniques empowers the patient to manage anxiety independently. For Ineffective Coping, encouraging expression of feelings validates the patient's experience and explores underlying issues. Assisting with identifying coping mechanisms fosters healthier emotional regulation and problem-solving, promoting long-term resilience.",
