B: Admitted yesterday evening. Home medications include lisinopril 20mg daily, metformin 500mg BID, and aspirin 81mg daily. A: CHF exacerbation. Currently on oxygen. New orders received at 07:30 include furosemide 40mg IV push STAT, digoxin 0.25mg IV push STAT, potassium chloride 20mEq PO BID, and insulin aspart 4 units subcutaneous now. R: Please assess medication orders and administer as appropriate. Re-evaluate respiratory status after furosemide administration. Contact provider if BP remains elevated or HR exceeds 120.",

    "correct": "Furosemide is appropriate for fluid overload, but potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L warrants holding the digoxin until potassium is repleted due to increased risk of digoxin toxicity. The potassium supplement is appropriate. Aspart insulin is also appropriate given the elevated blood glucose. The digoxin dose should be held and the provider notified of the patient's hypokalemia.",
    "incorrect": "Administering digoxin to a patient with hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, which can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Not addressing the potassium level puts the patient at significant risk. Insulin can be safely administered to address the elevated blood sugar. Furosemide helps reduce fluid overload, but it will further deplete potassium, making the hypokalemia even more dangerous in the context of digoxin administration.",
