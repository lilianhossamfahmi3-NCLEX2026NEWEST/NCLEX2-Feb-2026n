Recent CT scan showed no signs of hemorrhage, but some edema around the infarcted area. A: At 0700, patient’s GCS is 13 (E3, V4, M6). Right-sided weakness persists. BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, RR 22, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula. Noted new onset of nausea and vomiting at 0830. Pupils were equal and reactive at 0600, now left pupil is sluggishly reactive. R: I am concerned about increased intracranial pressure. Requesting orders for repeat neuro assessment, possible mannitol administration, and further evaluation of blood pressure control. Notify provider for any significant changes in neurological status.",

    "correct": "Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a dangerous complication post-stroke. Changes in vital signs and neurological status are key indicators. A rise in blood pressure, especially systolic, coupled with a decrease in heart rate and irregular respirations (Cushing's Triad) can signal worsening ICP. Declining GCS and sluggish pupil reactivity further confirm the decline. Nausea and vomiting are also common signs of increased ICP. The patient's labs are within acceptable limits and do not directly influence ICP changes. The stable medication administration also is not influencing the patient decline.",
    "incorrect": "Assuming a stable condition when neurological changes are present after a stroke can lead to delayed intervention and poorer outcomes. Dismissing subtle changes in vital signs or pupil reactivity as insignificant can be dangerous. The absence of new lab abnormalities does not rule out the possibility of neurological deterioration. The patient's medications are for chronic management and do not influence the change in condition.",
