His usual BP is around 110/70. He's on scheduled baclofen. A: At 15:15, his BP is 210/110, HR 55, skin is flushed above the injury level, diaphoretic, and goosebumps are present. He is complaining of nasal congestion. Bladder scan showed 600 mL urine. Bowel movement was yesterday. Neuro exam shows no new deficits besides those expected from his SCI. O: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I have elevated the head of the bed. I'm requesting orders for immediate intervention to lower his BP and address the cause. Monitor vitals q5min. Notify provider with changes. Anticipate need for catheterization.",
