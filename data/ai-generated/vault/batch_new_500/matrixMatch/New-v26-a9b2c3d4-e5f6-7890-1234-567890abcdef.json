B: Patient has been stable until now, with a baseline blood pressure around 110/70 mmHg. He is on scheduled baclofen. A: At 15:15, blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate 55 bpm. Skin is flushed above the level of injury, patient is diaphoretic, and goosebumps are present. Patient complains of nasal congestion. Bladder scan showed 600 mL urine. Bowel movement was yesterday. Neurological exam shows no new deficits besides those expected from his SCI. Lungs are clear. O: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I have elevated the head of the bed. I am requesting orders for immediate intervention to lower blood pressure and address the cause. Monitor vitals every 5 minutes. Notify provider with changes. Anticipate need for catheterization.",

        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia, triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of the spinal cord injury, leads to an exaggerated sympathetic response. This results in severe hypertension as the body attempts to compensate. The baroreceptors detect the elevated blood pressure and trigger a parasympathetic response, causing bradycardia. Vasodilation above the level of injury causes skin flushing, while diaphoresis is due to increased sympathetic activity. Bladder distention is a common cause of autonomic dysreflexia due to the stimulation of sensory receptors in the bladder wall, sending signals that the body cannot properly regulate due to the spinal cord injury.",
        "incorrect": "A normal WBC count does not directly indicate the presence or absence of autonomic dysreflexia. While infection can be a potential trigger for autonomic dysreflexia, the WBC count alone does not confirm or deny this. Further investigation is needed to rule out infection as the underlying cause. The focus should be on the acute symptoms and vital sign abnormalities.",
