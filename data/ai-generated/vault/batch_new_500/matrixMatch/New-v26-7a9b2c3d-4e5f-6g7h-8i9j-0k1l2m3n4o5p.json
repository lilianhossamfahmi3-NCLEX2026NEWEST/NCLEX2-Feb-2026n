Meds: furosemide 40 mg IV push BID, digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily, enalapril 5 mg PO BID, KCl 20 mEq PO BID. K+ is 3.2 mEq/L (hypokalemia). Complains of increased dyspnea/orthopnea. Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (renal impairment). No chest pain, anxious due to breathing. Alert and oriented x3. Furosemide addresses fluid overload. Digoxin manages rate. Enalapril reduces afterload. KCl corrects hypokalemia secondary to diuretic use. Monitor BP, HR, K+, and respiratory status closely. Continue oxygen therapy and elevate legs to reduce edema.",

        "correct": "Furosemide 40 mg IVP BID is a safe dose for this patient, given her HF exacerbation and fluid overload. Initial doses typically range from 20-40 mg IV. Digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily is safe, considering her age and renal function (elevated creatinine). Maintenance doses are 0.125-0.25 mg daily. Enalapril 5 mg PO BID is within the safe range for hypertension and heart failure; usual starting dose is 2.5-5 mg BID. Potassium chloride (KCl) 20 mEq PO BID is safe for correcting hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L). This dose is appropriate to start repletion, especially with diuretic use. The goal is to gradually increase potassium levels without causing hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a dose outside the safe range could lead to adverse effects such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, or drug toxicity. Furosemide doses above the typical range, without considering the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels, could result in significant potassium loss and dehydration. Higher doses of digoxin, without monitoring levels and renal function, could lead to digoxin toxicity, especially in elderly patients. Similarly, excessively high doses of enalapril could cause significant hypotension, particularly in patients with already compromised cardiac function. Overly aggressive potassium replacement could lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Failure to recognize renal impairment when dosing these medications can be lethal.",
