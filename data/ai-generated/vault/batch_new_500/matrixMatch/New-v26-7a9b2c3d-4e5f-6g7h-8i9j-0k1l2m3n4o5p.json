She reports worsening shortness of breath and significant lower extremity edema. Her weight is 90 kg. At 08:00, her vital signs were: BP 170/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm (sinus tachycardia), RR 28 breaths/min, and SpO2 89% on room air. Current medication orders include furosemide 40 mg IV push BID, digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily, enalapril 5 mg PO BID, and potassium chloride (KCl) 20 mEq PO BID. The patient's most recent potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L, indicating hypokalemia. She is currently complaining of increased dyspnea and orthopnea. Her latest creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL, suggesting some degree of renal impairment. She denies any chest pain but feels anxious due to her breathing difficulties. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.",

    "correct": "Furosemide 40 mg IVP BID is a safe dose for this patient's condition, given her HF exacerbation and fluid overload. The typical initial dose for furosemide in HF exacerbation ranges from 20-40 mg IV. Digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily is a safe dose for this patient, considering her age and renal function (elevated creatinine). The typical maintenance dose is 0.125-0.25 mg daily. Enalapril 5 mg PO BID is within the safe range for this patient, considering her hypertension and heart failure. The usual starting dose is 2.5-5 mg BID. Potassium chloride (KCl) 20 mEq PO BID is a safe dose for correcting the patient's hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L). A dose of 20 mEq is appropriate to start repletion, especially in the setting of diuretic use.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a dose outside the safe range could lead to adverse effects such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, or drug toxicity. Furosemide doses above the typical range, without considering the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels, could result in significant potassium loss and dehydration. Higher doses of digoxin, without monitoring levels and renal function, could lead to digoxin toxicity, especially in elderly patients. Similarly, excessively high doses of enalapril could cause significant hypotension, particularly in patients with already compromised cardiac function. Overly aggressive potassium replacement could lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Failure to recognize renal impairment when dosing these medications can be lethal.",
