He manages his bowel and bladder regimen at home with assistance. At 0800 today, patient reported a throbbing headache and feeling flushed. A: At 0815, assessment revealed BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, nasal congestion, and diaphoresis above the level of injury. Patient reports feeling anxious. Indwelling urinary catheter is in place and draining clear urine. Last bowel movement was two days ago. Lungs are clear. Skin intact except for expected pressure points. R: I suspect autonomic dysreflexia. I recommend checking the urinary catheter for kinks, assessing for bowel impaction, administering PRN nifedipine 10 mg SL for BP control. Monitor BP every 5 minutes and notify provider if BP remains elevated after 15 minutes.",

        "correct": "Removing the noxious stimuli resolves the precipitating cause of autonomic dysreflexia, thereby reducing the exaggerated sympathetic response and lowering blood pressure. Common triggers include bladder distension, bowel impaction, or skin irritation. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous pooling, reducing venous return and subsequently decreasing blood pressure. This is a simple, rapid intervention. Administering antihypertensive medication directly addresses the elevated blood pressure, mitigating the risk of complications such as stroke or seizure. Nifedipine is often used sublingually for rapid effect. Monitoring blood pressure frequently allows for timely assessment of the effectiveness of interventions and guides further management decisions. Continuous monitoring is crucial in the acute phase.",
        "incorrect": "Administering oxygen may be appropriate if hypoxemia is present, but it does not directly address the underlying cause or the elevated blood pressure in autonomic dysreflexia. Oxygen saturation should be assessed, but it's not the primary intervention. Increasing IV fluids can exacerbate hypertension in this condition. Autonomic dysreflexia causes fluid shifts that can worsen hypertension with increased volume. Applying restraints is contraindicated as it can increase agitation and potentially worsen the autonomic response. Restraints can increase noxious stimuli. Initiating a bladder training program is not an immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia and is a long-term rehabilitation goal. Acute management focuses on immediate symptom relief.",
