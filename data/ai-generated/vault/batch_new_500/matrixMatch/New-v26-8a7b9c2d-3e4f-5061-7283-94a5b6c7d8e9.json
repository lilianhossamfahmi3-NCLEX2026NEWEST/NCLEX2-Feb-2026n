This stimulus triggers an unopposed sympathetic reflex, causing intense vasoconstriction below the injury level and leading to severe hypertension. Baroreceptors detect this hypertension and activate a parasympathetic response (vagal stimulation), but it can only act above the injury level, causing bradycardia and vasodilation. The correct management involves a multi-pronged approach: immediately removing the cause, using gravity to lower BP, administering fast-acting vasodilators if needed, and closely monitoring the response.",
