    "sbar": "Situation: John Smith, a 35-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury sustained three years ago, was admitted to the ICU for a sudden, significant increase in blood pressure. Background: The patient reports experiencing a severe, throbbing headache and blurred vision. He is exhibiting diaphoresis above the level of his injury and also reports nasal congestion. At 0600, the patient voided 100mL of clear urine. At 0700, his blood pressure was measured at 210/110 mmHg, with a heart rate of 50 bpm. He is also complaining of feeling increasingly anxious and restless. Assessment: Autonomic dysreflexia is suspected due to the constellation of symptoms and patient history. Possible triggers being investigated include bowel impaction, urinary retention, and the presence of any pressure ulcers. Recent lab results and medication administration records are accessible in the electronic health record (EHR). Recommendation: A STAT rectal exam is recommended to check for fecal impaction. A bladder scan should be performed immediately to rule out urinary retention. Administer nifedipine 10mg sublingually (SL) as a PRN medication. Continuously monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes. Immediately elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to help lower blood pressure. Further investigation into potential skin breakdown is also warranted.",

    "correct": "Elevating the head of bed to 90 degrees helps to lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling. Checking for bladder distention is crucial as urinary retention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Administering nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, helps to lower blood pressure rapidly. Performing a rectal exam to check for impaction is essential as bowel impaction is another common trigger. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes allows for close observation of the patient's response to interventions. Loosening tight clothing helps to remove any external stimuli that could be contributing to the dysreflexia.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a fluid bolus is contraindicated as it can further elevate blood pressure. Lowering the head of bed will increase blood return to the heart, potentially worsening hypertension. Encouraging the patient to lie flat will increase blood pressure. Delaying the rectal exam could prolong the episode of autonomic dysreflexia and lead to complications. Decreasing frequency of blood pressure monitoring could result in delayed intervention. Leaving tight clothing in place may exacerbate the trigger.",
