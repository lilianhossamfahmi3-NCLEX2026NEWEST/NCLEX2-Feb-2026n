Background: The patient reports a severe, throbbing headache and blurred vision. He is diaphoretic above the level of injury and reports nasal congestion. At 0600, he voided 100 mL of clear urine. At 0700, his blood pressure was 210/110 mmHg, with a heart rate of 50 bpm. He also reports anxiety and restlessness. Assessment: Autonomic dysreflexia is suspected, given the symptoms and history. Possible triggers being investigated include bowel impaction, urinary retention, and pressure ulcers. Recommendation: STAT rectal exam to check for fecal impaction. Immediate bladder scan to rule out urinary retention. Administer nifedipine 10 mg sublingually (SL) as a PRN medication. Continuously monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes. Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to lower blood pressure. Investigate potential skin breakdown.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees helps lower blood pressure by promoting venous pooling and decreasing venous return. Checking for bladder distention is crucial because urinary retention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Administering nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, helps to rapidly lower blood pressure by causing vasodilation. Performing a rectal exam to check for impaction is essential because bowel impaction is another common trigger. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes allows for close observation of the patient's response to interventions, enabling timely adjustments to the treatment plan. Loosening tight clothing helps to remove any external stimuli that could be contributing to the dysreflexia and exacerbating the hypertensive response.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a fluid bolus is contraindicated because it can further elevate blood pressure, potentially worsening the hypertensive crisis. Lowering the head of the bed will increase blood return to the heart, potentially worsening hypertension. Encouraging the patient to lie flat will increase blood pressure and is therefore contraindicated. Delaying the rectal exam could prolong the episode of autonomic dysreflexia and lead to complications such as stroke or seizure. Decreasing the frequency of blood pressure monitoring could result in delayed intervention and failure to recognize worsening hypertension. Leaving tight clothing in place may exacerbate the trigger and worsen the autonomic response.",
