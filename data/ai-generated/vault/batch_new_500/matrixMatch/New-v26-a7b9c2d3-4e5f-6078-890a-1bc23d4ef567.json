His current weight is 7 kg. B: Mother reports this is Ethan's third tet spell this month. Cardiology has been consulted. A: At 07:30, the infant is irritable, with a respiratory rate of 52, heart rate of 180, and mild retractions. Auscultation reveals a harsh systolic murmur. Temperature is 37.2°C (99°F). Current IV fluids are D10W at 25 mL/hr. Labs were drawn at 06:00. R: Orders include morphine sulfate IV PRN for tet spells and preparation for possible surgical intervention. Oxygen PRN is ordered to maintain saturation >85%. I am calling to discuss current management strategies for preventing further tet spells.",

        "correct": "Knee-chest positioning increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing right-to-left shunting and improving pulmonary blood flow, thus alleviating cyanosis. Morphine sulfate reduces pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, breaking the tet spell cycle. Supplemental oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, improving oxygen saturation. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, prevents tet spells by decreasing heart rate and contractility, reducing oxygen demand. Decreasing stimulation reduces oxygen demand and can help calm the infant during a tet spell.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing IV fluid rate may worsen pulmonary congestion, a potential complication in infants with congenital heart defects. Rapid infusion could exacerbate existing cardiac strain. Placing the infant supine during a tet spell worsens oxygenation due to increased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The knee-chest position is preferred. Increasing stimulation will likely worsen the tet spell by increasing oxygen demand and potentially agitating the infant.",
