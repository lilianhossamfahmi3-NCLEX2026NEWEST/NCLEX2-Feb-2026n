The roommate stated that Sergeant Miller has been increasingly isolated and making statements such as, \"I'm no use to anyone.\" B: The patient is a veteran with a history of PTSD and depression, recently discharged from active duty. He was prescribed sertraline 100mg daily three weeks ago. There are no known prior suicide attempts. A: The patient is currently drowsy but responsive to sternal rub. His vital signs at 07:45 were: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air, and Temp 97.8°F (36.6°C). Initial lab results are pending. A psychiatry consult was ordered at 08:00. R: Continue to closely monitor vital signs and ensure patient safety. Await further orders from the psychiatrist. Initiate suicide precautions and maintain continuous cardiac monitoring.",

Removing potentially harmful objects minimizes the risk of self-harm by eliminating available means. Initiating IV fluids is appropriate to address the patient's hypotension secondary to the overdose, supporting hemodynamic stability. A psychiatric evaluation is crucial for determining the underlying cause of the suicide attempt, assessing mental health status, and developing an appropriate treatment plan. Communication with the patient's family provides valuable information about the patient's baseline behavior, recent stressors, and support system, aiding in comprehensive care planning.",
        "incorrect": "Leaving the patient alone is contraindicated due to the high risk of another suicide attempt; constant monitoring is paramount. Delaying the psychiatric consult could prolong the patient's distress and delay necessary treatment, potentially worsening the patient's condition. While medication reconciliation is important, it's not the priority at this immediate moment given the acute nature of the situation; stabilizing the patient takes precedence. Dismissing the patient's feelings minimizes their distress and can hinder therapeutic rapport, impeding the establishment of a trusting relationship. Ignoring the patient's history of PTSD could lead to ineffective treatment planning, as PTSD significantly influences mental health and coping mechanisms.",
