Implementing 1:1 continuous observation directly addresses this risk, providing constant monitoring to prevent access to harmful means and allowing for immediate intervention.",

The immediate risk of self-harm outweighs the moderate hypotension. Contacting the family is important for care planning but is not an immediate life-saving action.
