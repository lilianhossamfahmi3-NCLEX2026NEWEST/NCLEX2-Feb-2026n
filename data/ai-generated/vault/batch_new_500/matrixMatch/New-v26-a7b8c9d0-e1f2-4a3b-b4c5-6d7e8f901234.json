His O2 saturation is 88% on room air. B: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The acute MI was confirmed by troponin levels and EKG changes. A: At 07:00, the patient reported increased shortness of breath. Auscultation revealed crackles bilaterally in the lower lobes. Lower extremity edema is 2+ bilaterally. He is currently receiving 0.9% NS IV at 20 mL/hr. His medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, and furosemide. At 07:30, furosemide 40mg IV push was administered. R: I recommend further evaluation for possible heart failure exacerbation and potential adjustments to his medication regimen. I will continue to monitor his vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status. I notified Dr. Smith at 07:35.",

Crackles are more indicative of left-sided heart failure due to pulmonary congestion, where fluid backs up into the lungs. Peripheral edema is a primary sign of right-sided heart failure due to systemic venous congestion, increasing hydrostatic pressure. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism seen in both left and right-sided heart failure as the heart attempts to maintain cardiac output. Hyponatremia can occur in both due to fluid retention, leading to dilution of sodium levels. The elevated troponin is related to the recent MI, but the BNP is indicative of heart failure.",

Understanding the pathophysiology behind each symptom is crucial. For example, edema is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in the venous system in right-sided heart failure, while crackles are caused by fluid backing up into the lungs in left-sided heart failure.",
