B: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Acute MI confirmed by troponin levels and EKG changes. A: At 0700, patient reported increased shortness of breath. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally in lower lobes. Lower extremity edema is 2+ bilaterally. IV of 0.9% NS at 20 mL/hr. Medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, and furosemide. At 0730, furosemide 40mg IV push was administered. R: I recommend further evaluation for possible heart failure exacerbation and potential adjustments to medication regimen. I will continue to monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status. Notified Dr. Smith at 0735.",
