        "sbar": "Situation: Sergeant David Miller, a 20-year-old male, was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit at 16:30 today following a suicide attempt involving an overdose of prescribed sleeping pills. Background: Sergeant Miller is an active-duty soldier with a history of depression and PTSD stemming from a recent deployment. He reports feelings of hopelessness and profound isolation. Assessment: Upon admission at 16:30, Sergeant Miller was somnolent but arousable to verbal stimuli. His vital signs are: HR 110 bpm, BP 100/60 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, and SpO2 96% on room air. He verbalizes, \"I just want the pain to stop.\" While he denies current suicidal ideation, his affect is notably flat and constricted. A comprehensive risk assessment indicates a high suicide risk. Recommendation: Initiate continuous one-on-one observation, implement suicide precautions immediately, administer prescribed medications as ordered, and provide consistent emotional support and therapeutic communication. Engage the mental health team for thorough ongoing evaluation and collaborative treatment planning. Contact chaplain services per the patient's request. Ensure a completely safe environment by removing all potentially harmful objects. A thorough room search was completed at 17:00. Reassess suicide risk at the beginning of each shift and as needed.",

        "correct": "Providing one-on-one continuous observation is crucial for patients at high risk for suicide to prevent self-harm, as it allows for immediate intervention if needed. Encouraging expression of feelings validates the patient's emotions, fosters trust, and promotes therapeutic communication, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and hopelessness. Removing potentially dangerous items from the patient's environment minimizes the risk of self-harm by eliminating readily available means. Documenting the patient's behavior and statements in the medical record provides a comprehensive record of the patient's mental state, facilitates communication among the care team, and informs ongoing treatment planning. Clinical Pearl: Continuous observation doesn't mean constant questioning; allow the patient space while ensuring safety.",
        "incorrect": "Leaving the patient alone, even briefly, is contraindicated due to the high risk of suicide; constant observation is paramount. Dismissing the patient's feelings invalidates their experience, can increase feelings of isolation and hopelessness, and undermines the therapeutic relationship. Administering PRN medications without assessment is not patient-centered care; it's crucial to assess the patient's current anxiety level and consider non-pharmacological interventions first. Clinical Pearl: Always assess before medicating, especially with PRN medications.
