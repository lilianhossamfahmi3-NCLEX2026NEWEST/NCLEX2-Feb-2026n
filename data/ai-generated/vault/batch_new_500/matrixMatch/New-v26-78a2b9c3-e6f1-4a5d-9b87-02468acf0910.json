He was admitted electively but required post-operative intubation due to respiratory depression. B: Mr. Tyrell has a history of COPD and underwent elective surgery. Post-operatively, he needed intubation for respiratory depression. A: At 07:00, SpO2 is 88% on FiO2 60%, PEEP 5 cm H2O. Ventilator settings: rate 14 breaths/min, tidal volume 450 mL. ABG results: pH 7.28, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 25 mEq/L. Bilateral diminished breath sounds are noted. PIP is elevated at 35 cm H2O. The patient is agitated, attempting to remove the endotracheal tube. R: I'm concerned about respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and potential VILI due to elevated PIP. I request orders for immediate ventilator adjustments, including increased tidal volume and PEEP changes, along with sedation to improve oxygenation and ventilation. A bronchodilator may also be beneficial.",

        "correct": "Increasing the tidal volume will improve ventilation, decreasing PaCO2. Increasing FiO2 improves oxygenation, raising PaO2. A neuromuscular blocking agent reduces agitation and oxygen demand, aiding effective ventilation. Addressing elevated PIP with a bronchodilator is also important. ABGs, vitals, and patient presentation indicate hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis. The patient's elevated PaCO2 (58 mmHg) indicates inadequate ventilation. Increasing the tidal volume will help to eliminate CO2 more effectively. The low PaO2 (65 mmHg) indicates hypoxemia, and increasing the FiO2 will increase the fraction of inspired oxygen, thereby improving oxygenation. The elevated PIP (35 cm H2O) suggests increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance. A bronchodilator can help to reduce airway resistance. Neuromuscular blocking agents can reduce patient agitation and improve synchrony with the ventilator.",
        "incorrect": "Decreasing PEEP can cause alveolar collapse, worsening oxygenation. Decreasing tidal volume worsens ventilation, increasing PaCO2. Decreasing FiO2 worsens oxygenation, decreasing PaO2. Restricting fluids doesn't address respiratory issues and can cause dehydration. Decreasing PEEP could lead to alveolar collapse and worsen oxygenation. PEEP helps to keep the alveoli open at the end of expiration, and reducing it could lead to atelectasis. Decreasing the tidal volume would worsen ventilation and further increase the PaCO2 level. Restricting fluids would not address the underlying respiratory issues and could lead to dehydration.",
