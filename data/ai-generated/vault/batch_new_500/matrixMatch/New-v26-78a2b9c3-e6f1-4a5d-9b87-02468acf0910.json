    "sbar": "S: Jameson Tyrell is a 68-year-old male, post-operative day 2 following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His past medical history includes COPD. He was admitted for elective surgery and required post-operative intubation due to respiratory depression. B: The patient has a history of COPD and was admitted electively. Post-operatively, he required intubation due to respiratory depression. A: At 07:00, the patient's SpO2 is 88% on FiO2 60%, with PEEP at 5 cm H2O. Current ventilator settings include a rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results reveal: pH 7.28, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, and HCO3 25 mEq/L. Upon chest auscultation, diminished breath sounds are noted bilaterally. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is elevated at 35 cm H2O. The patient is increasingly agitated and is actively attempting to remove the endotracheal tube. R: I am concerned about the patient's respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and the potential risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) given the elevated PIP. I am requesting orders for immediate ventilator setting adjustments, including increasing the tidal volume and considering a change in PEEP, along with the administration of sedation to improve both oxygenation and ventilation. A bronchodilator may also be helpful.",

    "correct": "Increasing the tidal volume will improve ventilation and help to reduce the PaCO2 level. Increasing the FiO2 will improve oxygenation and help to increase the PaO2 level. Administering a neuromuscular blocking agent will decrease the patient's agitation and oxygen demand, allowing the ventilator to effectively ventilate the lungs. Addressing the elevated PIP with a bronchodilator is important. The ABGs, vitals and patient presentation indicate hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis.",
    "incorrect": "Decreasing the PEEP could lead to alveolar collapse and worsen oxygenation. Decreasing the tidal volume would worsen ventilation and further increase the PaCO2 level.
