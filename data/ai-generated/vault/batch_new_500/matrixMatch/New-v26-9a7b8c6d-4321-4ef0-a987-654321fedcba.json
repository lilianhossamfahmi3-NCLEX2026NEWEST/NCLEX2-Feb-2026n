Rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation at 04:00. History of 40-pack-year smoking. Lives alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, which poses a barrier to follow-up appointments. Allergies include penicillin.\nA: On admission to ICU, client is sedated on a propofol and fentanyl infusion. Vital signs are stable post-intubation. Breath sounds are coarse bilaterally with rhonchi. Initial ventilator settings are FiO2 0.6, RR 16, TV 450 mL, PEEP 5 cm H2O. ETT is 23 cm at the lip.\nR: Plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, administer IV antibiotics and fluids, and monitor hemodynamic status closely. Obtain baseline labs and chest x-ray.\n\nProgress Note (07:00):\nS: Reporting on the 68-year-old male on mechanical ventilation for pneumonia.\nB: Client has been hemodynamically stable until the last hour. Vitals have been trending downwards. He has become increasingly restless despite sedation.\nA: At 07:00, HR 110, BP 90/60 (MAP 70), SpO2 90% on FiO2 0.6. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has risen to 35 cm H2O. Physical assessment reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side and slight tracheal deviation to the right. Minimal urine output noted. Labs from 06:00 show leukocytosis and an elevated lactate level.\nR: Concerned for a possible tension pneumothorax given the acute change. This is a life-threatening emergency. Recommend immediate provider notification and preparation for emergent chest decompression. Will remain at the bedside for continuous monitoring."

This directly addresses the root cause of the client's instability.",
