He was admitted at 07:00 with deep cyanosis and respiratory distress.\nB: The infant has a history of similar episodes, but his mother reports this is the most severe. He lives in a rural community, delaying access to specialized care. His home medication is propranolol.\nA: Initial SpO2 was 68% on room air. Despite applying 100% oxygen via face mask, his SpO2 has dropped to 65%. He is increasingly lethargic with a heart rate of 185/min and respiratory rate of 62/min with severe retractions. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. STAT ABG results show severe hypoxemia (PaO2 45) and mixed acidosis (pH 7.28).\nR: Recommend immediate administration of IV morphine and sodium bicarbonate. An IV fluid bolus is also indicated to improve perfusion and decrease blood viscosity from polycythemia. Respiratory therapy is on standby for potential intubation."

This leads to profound hypoxemia and acidosis. The correct interventions address the distinct pathophysiological components of the spell: morphine reduces infundibular spasm and calms the infant to decrease oxygen demand; sodium bicarbonate corrects the resulting metabolic acidosis; preparing for intubation addresses impending respiratory failure; and an IV fluid bolus improves systemic perfusion and reduces blood viscosity from compensatory polycythemia.",

For example, giving sodium bicarbonate for irritability without recognizing the acidosis on the ABG is treating a symptom without data. Administering an IV bolus as the primary response to severe respiratory distress misses the priority of securing the airway. Each intervention has a specific target, and incorrect pairing can delay life-saving care.",

Poor perfusion (cap refill 4 seconds) suggests decreased systemic vascular resistance or dehydration. An isotonic IV fluid bolus (0.9% NaCl) is needed to increase preload, improve systemic perfusion, and decrease blood viscosity, reducing the risk of a thromboembolic event."

While essential, 100% O2 is often insufficient during a severe Tet spell because the problem is a shunt, not a ventilation issue. The deoxygenated blood bypasses the lungs entirely, so interventions must target the shunt itself.",
