He has a history of similar episodes. BACKGROUND: Liam was diagnosed at 2 weeks old. His mother reports increased irritability, worsening cyanosis, and difficulty breathing, even when using the knee-chest position at home. Current medications include Propranolol 1 mg PO BID, last given at 06:00. ASSESSMENT: At 07:00, Liam is irritable and crying. His oxygen saturation is 68% on room air. Heart rate is 180 bpm, and respiratory rate is 60 bpm with moderate intercostal retractions. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. His skin is mottled. At 07:15, his color is worsening, now dusky. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend obtaining a STAT blood gas, increasing oxygen to 100% via face mask, administering morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV push for the hypercyanotic spell, and preparing for possible intubation. I notified the cardiologist and respiratory therapy at 07:15.",

        "correct": "Administering morphine sulfate IV push is indicated because it helps reduce respiratory effort and pulmonary vascular resistance, breaking the hypercyanotic spell by reducing the shunting of deoxygenated blood. Elevating the head of the bed is indicated to improve oxygenation by reducing abdominal pressure on the diaphragm, facilitating better lung expansion. Preparing for possible intubation is indicated because the infant's increased respiratory rate, retractions, and decreasing oxygen saturation suggest impending respiratory failure, requiring advanced airway management. Administering sodium bicarbonate IV push is indicated to correct the metabolic acidosis indicated by the blood gas results (pH 7.28, PaCO2 58 mmHg), which can result from hypoxemia and anaerobic metabolism.",
        "incorrect": "Each incorrect match represents a misunderstanding of the immediate interventions required during a hypercyanotic spell in a child with Tetralogy of Fallot. Failing to administer morphine or sodium bicarbonate promptly or delaying respiratory support can have severe consequences, leading to worsening hypoxemia, acidosis, and potential cardiac arrest. Positioning, oxygen administration, and preparing for advanced interventions are all crucial components of managing these critical episodes, and incorrect matching indicates a lack of prioritization and understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.",
