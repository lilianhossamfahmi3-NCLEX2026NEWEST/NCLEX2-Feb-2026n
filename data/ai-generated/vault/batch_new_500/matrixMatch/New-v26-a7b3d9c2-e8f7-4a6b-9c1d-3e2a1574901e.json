    "sbar": "SITUATION: Liam Miller, a 6-month-old male with Tetralogy of Fallot, is admitted to the ICU for a hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell). He has a history of cyanotic episodes. BACKGROUND: Liam was diagnosed at 2 weeks old. His mother reports increased irritability, worsening cyanosis, and difficulty breathing despite using the knee-chest position at home. Current medications include Propranolol 1mg PO BID. ASSESSMENT: At 07:00, Liam is irritable and crying. His oxygen saturation is 68% on room air. Heart rate is 180 bpm, and respiratory rate is 60 bpm with moderate intercostal retractions. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. His skin is mottled. At 07:15, his color is worsening, now dusky. RECOMMENDATION: Obtain a STAT blood gas, increase oxygen to 100% via face mask, administer morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV push for the hypercyanotic spell, and prepare for possible intubation. I have already notified the cardiologist and respiratory therapy.",

    "correct": "Administer morphine sulfate IV push is indicated because it helps to reduce respiratory effort and pulmonary vascular resistance, breaking the hypercyanotic spell. Elevate the head of the bed is indicated to improve oxygenation by reducing abdominal pressure on the diaphragm. Prepare for possible intubation is indicated because the infant's increased respiratory rate, retractions, and decreasing oxygen saturation suggest impending respiratory failure. Administer sodium bicarbonate IV push is indicated to correct the metabolic acidosis indicated by the blood gas results (pH 7.28, PaCO2 58 mmHg).",
    "incorrect": "Each incorrect match represents a misunderstanding of the immediate interventions required during a hypercyanotic spell in a child with Tetralogy of Fallot. Failing to administer morphine or sodium bicarbonate promptly or delaying respiratory support can have severe consequences. Positioning, oxygen administration, and preparing for advanced interventions are all crucial components of managing these critical episodes.",

Consider the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot and the specific mechanisms by which each intervention addresses the problem. Prioritize interventions based on their potential to immediately improve the patient's condition and prevent further deterioration."
