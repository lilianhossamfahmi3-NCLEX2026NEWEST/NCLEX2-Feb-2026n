He was initially started on antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. A: At 0600, the patient's SpO2 dropped to 88% despite increasing the FiO2 to 60%. Respiratory rate is 32 and shallow with coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results at 0615 reveal: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, and HCO3 26 mEq/L. The patient is increasingly agitated and confused. Current ventilator settings are: FiO2 60%, PEEP 5 cm H2O. The last dose of morphine 2mg IV was administered at 0400. R: I am requesting orders for further management of acute respiratory failure. I am considering escalation of respiratory support, including increasing PEEP and potentially paralysis if the patient continues to decompensate. Please notify the attending physician of this significant status change immediately. The next antibiotic dose is due at 1000.",

    "correct": "ARDS is characterized by acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging (assumed based on the description of bilateral crackles and pneumonia), and severe hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen therapy (PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300; in this case, 58/0.6 = 97). The patient's ABGs demonstrate hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 55 mmHg), indicating acute respiratory failure. The SBAR describes an increasing FiO2 requirement to maintain acceptable SpO2 levels, suggesting the patient meets the hypoxemia criteria for ARDS. Elevated WBC and lactate could be related to underlying infection but do not rule out ARDS. The patient's history of COPD could contribute to respiratory failure but the rapid decline is more consistent with ARDS pathophysiology.",
    "incorrect": "While some findings may be present in other respiratory conditions, the constellation of hypoxemia refractory to oxygen, hypercapnia, and bilateral infiltrates strongly suggests ARDS. COPD exacerbation can cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia, but not usually to this degree so quickly, especially with increasing oxygen administration, and does not fully explain the acute deterioration. Pneumonia alone, while present initially, cannot explain the continued decline despite antibiotic administration and increasing oxygen. Pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause acute respiratory distress, but is not supported by the current data. CHF could contribute to respiratory distress but the ABG values and rapid deterioration more strongly point to ARDS.",
