He is tearful, withdrawn, and expresses feelings of worthlessness. Vital signs are stable. He denies current suicidal ideation, but states, \"I just don't see things getting better.\" Labs show elevated liver enzymes, consistent with acetaminophen overdose. R: Continue to monitor for suicidal ideation. Implement suicide precautions. Consult with psychiatry. Administer prescribed acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) per protocol.
