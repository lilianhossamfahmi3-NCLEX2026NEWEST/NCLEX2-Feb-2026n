B: History of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin). Last dose of warfarin was 20:00 last night. A: At 07:00, patient’s GCS is 11 (Eyes 2, Verbal 4, Motor 5). Right-sided weakness persists. BP is 180/100 mmHg. Heart rate is 90 bpm, irregular. RR is 14 and regular. O2 saturation is 96% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids at 75 mL/hr. INR is 2.8. A new assessment at 08:00 reveals changes that require evaluation. R: Please assess the following findings and determine if they indicate improvement, decline, or no change. Be prepared to administer labetalol if blood pressure remains elevated despite initial dose. Monitor neurological status closely and notify the physician of any further decline. Consider a swallow evaluation due to aspiration risk.",

    "correct": "Increased blood pressure indicates a decline as hypertension exacerbates cerebral edema and increases ICP following a stroke. Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) indicates a decline in neurological function and level of consciousness, a key sign of worsening ICP. Decreased respiratory rate can indicate a decline as it may lead to CO2 retention, which further increases ICP. Decreased oxygen saturation indicates a decline, potentially due to hypoventilation related to increased ICP affecting the respiratory center. Decreased heart rate in the context of hypertension and declining GCS indicates a decline (Cushing's Triad).",
    "incorrect": "Improvement would be indicated by decreased blood pressure, increased GCS, increased respiratory rate, increased oxygen saturation, or increased heart rate (although bradycardia with hypertension can indicate Cushing's Triad). No change would be indicated if the vitals and GCS remained stable from the previous assessment.",
