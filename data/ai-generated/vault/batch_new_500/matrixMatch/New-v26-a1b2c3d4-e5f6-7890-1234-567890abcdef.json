Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is essential to remove excess fluid and improve respiratory status. While it will likely worsen the existing hypokalemia, the risk of acute respiratory failure from pulmonary edema outweighs the risk of the electrolyte imbalance, which can be corrected concurrently with potassium supplementation."

Seeing fluid overload and giving furosemide is correct, but seeing hypertension and giving lisinopril without checking renal labs, or seeing a 'therapeutic' digoxin level and giving it without checking potassium, are common and dangerous errors. Always synthesize all available data.",
