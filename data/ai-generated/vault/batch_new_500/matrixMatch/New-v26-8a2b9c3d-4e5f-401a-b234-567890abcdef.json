He has not been eating or drinking well for 3 days due to a recent upper respiratory infection. A: On arrival, patient is lethargic, BP 90/60, HR 130, RR 36 and deep, Temp 102.2°F (39°C), SpO2 92% on room air. Glucose 780 mg/dL, K+ 5.8 mEq/L. The patient is also diaphoretic and agitated when stimulated. BGL trending upwards since arrival. EKG shows sinus tachycardia. UO minimal since arrival. Assessment reveals dehydration. O: Requesting orders for fluid resuscitation, insulin drip, potassium monitoring, and thyroid function tests.",
