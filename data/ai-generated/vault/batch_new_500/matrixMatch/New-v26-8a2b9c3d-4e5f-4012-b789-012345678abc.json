This condition involves a systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to massive vasodilation, capillary leakage, and impaired tissue perfusion, which triggers compensatory mechanisms and ultimately causes end-organ dysfunction.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrectly matching these clinical cues would indicate a failure to connect the systemic effects of sepsis with their underlying causes. For example, attributing tachycardia to infection alone, rather than as a compensatory response to hypotension, misses a critical step in hemodynamic analysis and could delay appropriate interventions like fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.",

The body's baroreceptors detect this hypotension and trigger a sympathetic nervous system response, releasing catecholamines. This results in tachycardia as a compensatory mechanism to increase cardiac output (CO = HR x SV) and maintain organ perfusion."

This, combined with profound vasodilation, creates a state of relative and absolute hypovolemia. Central Venous Pressure (CVP) measures right atrial pressure (preload), so a low CVP directly reflects this decreased venous return to the heart."
