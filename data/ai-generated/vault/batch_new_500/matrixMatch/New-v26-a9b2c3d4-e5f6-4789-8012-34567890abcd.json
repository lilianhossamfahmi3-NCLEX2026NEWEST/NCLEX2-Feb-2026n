Has had several 'tet spells' managed at home with knee-chest positioning. This is his first hospitalization for surgical repair. ASSESSMENT: At 14:00, infant became acutely cyanotic, O2 saturation dropped to 68%, heart rate 180 bpm, respiratory rate 60, agitated, crying inconsolably. Mom reports this started suddenly. Vital signs stable prior. Auscultation reveals loud systolic murmur. Current medications include PRN morphine sulfate for tet spells, and scheduled propranolol. RECOMMENDATION: Provider notified at 14:05 and ordered oxygen via face mask at 100%, morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV push, and stat CBC and electrolytes. Please evaluate and implement orders efficiently. The infant appears distressed, and time is of the essence.",

    "correct": "Placing the infant in the knee-chest position decreases venous return from the legs and increases systemic vascular resistance, which forces more blood into the pulmonary circulation, improving oxygenation. Administering morphine sulfate helps to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and also sedates the infant, reducing oxygen demand. Administering 100% oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, which can help to improve oxygen saturation. Monitoring vital signs frequently is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of interventions and detecting any adverse effects. Maintaining a calm environment helps reduce the infant's anxiety and crying, which further decreases oxygen demand and the severity of the tet spell.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a diuretic is contraindicated during a tet spell because it reduces blood volume, potentially worsening the cyanosis and hypoxemia. Increasing stimulation would further agitate the infant and increase oxygen demand, exacerbating the tet spell. Initiating oral feeding is unsafe due to the infant's respiratory distress and increased risk of aspiration. Placing the infant supine will not improve venous return or oxygenation as effectively as the knee-chest position. Delaying morphine administration can prolong the tet spell and increase the risk of complications.",
