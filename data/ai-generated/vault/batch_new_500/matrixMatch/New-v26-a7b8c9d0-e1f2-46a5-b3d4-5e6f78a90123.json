At 07:00, BP was 168/102 mmHg, HR 58 bpm. The patient complains of a severe headache and nasal congestion. Skin is flushed above the injury level and diaphoretic. A: Autonomic dysreflexia is suspected. The physician was notified. Orders are being reviewed, and interventions are being implemented. O2 sat is 98% on trach collar. The last bowel movement was two days ago. A Foley catheter is in place with adequate urine output. No known history of hypertension prior to SCI. At 07:15, BP remains elevated at 170/105 mmHg despite initial interventions. Awaiting physician orders for pharmacological intervention. Guidance is needed on immediate nursing actions to further manage his blood pressure and identify potential triggers. At 07:20, the patient reports feeling anxious and expresses concern about his elevated blood pressure. Reassurance and continued monitoring are essential to maintain patient comfort and safety.",

        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed is crucial to decrease cerebral blood pressure and mitigate the risk of stroke. Assessing for bladder distension is a priority because a full bladder is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Checking for bowel impaction by performing a digital rectal exam (with anesthetic lubricant due to potential for stimulation) is also important, as bowel impaction is another frequent trigger. Monitoring blood pressure every 5 minutes allows for close observation of the patient's response to interventions and early detection of further deterioration. Administering antihypertensive medication as prescribed is essential to control the elevated blood pressure and prevent complications.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker without a specific order and without knowing the patient's full medication history is dangerous due to the potential for precipitous drop in blood pressure and bradycardia, especially in a patient with an already low heart rate. This could exacerbate the situation. Placing the patient in a supine position would increase cerebral blood pressure and worsen the hypertensive crisis. Waiting for further orders before initiating any interventions would delay crucial treatment and potentially lead to severe complications such as stroke or seizure.",
