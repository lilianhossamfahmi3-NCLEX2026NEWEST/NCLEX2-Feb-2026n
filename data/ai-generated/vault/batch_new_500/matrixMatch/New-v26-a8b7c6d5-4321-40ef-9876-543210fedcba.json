A: Concern for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Blood cultures ordered, awaiting results. Lactate 3.5 mmol/L. Alert and oriented to person/place. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin & Cefepime) initiated at 11:00. R: Requires close monitoring, especially BP and urine output. Possible fluid bolus for hypotension. Continue antibiotics.
