She reports increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. O: At 07:00, vital signs were: BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, and SpO2 90% on room air. Auscultation revealed crackles in both lungs. Lower extremity edema is 2+. Labs were drawn at 07:30. A: The patient is experiencing heart failure exacerbation, likely due to fluid overload. Hypokalemia is also noted based on lab results. B: The physician was notified at 07:15 and provided new orders. The current medication orders include furosemide 40 mg IV push, digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq PO BID, and enalapril 5 mg PO daily. Vitals were reassessed at 08:00 and are as follows: BP 155/92 mmHg, HR 105 bpm, RR 26 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. The patient is also being placed on droplet precautions due to a possible respiratory infection.",

    "correct": "The furosemide dose is appropriate for addressing fluid overload in heart failure, considering the patient's elevated blood pressure and respiratory rate. The digoxin dose is safe, considering the therapeutic digoxin level of 0.6 ng/mL. The potassium chloride dose is appropriate, given the patient's hypokalemia (K+ 3.2 mEq/L), which can be exacerbated by furosemide. The enalapril dose is safe, but requires close monitoring of BP due to the patient's already elevated blood pressure.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding furosemide would not address the fluid overload contributing to the patient's respiratory distress. The digoxin level is within the therapeutic range, making withholding inappropriate. Not administering potassium chloride could worsen the patient's hypokalemia, potentially leading to arrhythmias. While enalapril requires monitoring, it's indicated for heart failure management and should not be withheld without further assessment or contraindications.",
