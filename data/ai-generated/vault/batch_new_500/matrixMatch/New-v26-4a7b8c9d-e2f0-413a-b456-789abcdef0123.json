He was admitted for pneumonia and now presents with altered mental status, rapid breathing, and severe dehydration. B: His history includes Type 2 Diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemics, but he's non-compliant with his diet. He was admitted at 04:00 for pneumonia. A: As of 11:00, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, exhibiting Kussmaul respirations and fruity breath odor. His vital signs are: HR 130 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 36, Temp 38.9°C (102°F), SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Lab results show Glucose 650 mg/dL, pH 7.2, HCO3 10 mEq/L, positive serum ketones. TSH is <0.01 mIU/L, and Free T4 is >6 ng/dL. He is also agitated and diaphoretic. R: We have STAT orders for an insulin drip, fluids, and electrolyte replacement. I urgently need guidance on the best management approach, considering the strong possibility of both Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and a concurrent thyroid storm. His pneumonia requires droplet isolation precautions.",

        "correct": "Insulin administration is crucial in DKA to facilitate glucose uptake into cells and correct the metabolic acidosis. IV fluids (0.9% Normal Saline) are essential to address the severe dehydration caused by osmotic diuresis in DKA and hypermetabolism in thyroid storm. Potassium replacement is often necessary in DKA as insulin administration drives potassium intracellularly, potentially leading to hypokalemia. Beta-blockers (e.g., Propranolol) are a cornerstone of thyroid storm management, helping to control tachycardia, arrhythmias, and other adrenergic symptoms. Cooling blankets are indicated to manage the hyperthermia associated with both thyroid storm and infection. Propylthiouracil (PTU) or Methimazole administration inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, a key intervention in thyroid storm.",
        "incorrect": "While dextrose may eventually be needed if the patient becomes hypoglycemic due to insulin administration, it is contraindicated at the initial stage of DKA management when the glucose level is already dangerously high. Antipyretics alone are insufficient to manage the severe hyperthermia in this case, which is compounded by thyroid storm. Sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended unless the pH is severely low (<7.0) due to the risk of rebound alkalosis and cerebral edema. Increasing oxygen flow rate may be necessary if SpO2 does not improve but is not a primary intervention at this stage. Diuretics are contraindicated as the patient is already severely dehydrated from DKA.",
