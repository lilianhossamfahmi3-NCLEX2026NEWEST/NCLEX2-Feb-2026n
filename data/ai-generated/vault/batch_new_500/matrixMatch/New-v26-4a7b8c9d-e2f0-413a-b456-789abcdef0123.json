        "correct": "Insulin administration is crucial in DKA to facilitate glucose uptake into cells and correct metabolic acidosis. IV fluids (0.9% Normal Saline) address severe dehydration from osmotic diuresis in DKA and hypermetabolism in thyroid storm. Potassium replacement is necessary as insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, risking hypokalemia. Beta-blockers (e.g., Propranolol) manage tachycardia, arrhythmias, and adrenergic symptoms of thyroid storm. Cooling blankets manage hyperthermia from thyroid storm and infection. Propylthiouracil (PTU) inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, a key intervention in thyroid storm.",
        "incorrect": "Dextrose is contraindicated initially in DKA due to already high glucose levels; it's used later if hypoglycemia occurs from insulin. Antipyretics alone are insufficient for severe hyperthermia compounded by thyroid storm. Sodium bicarbonate is generally avoided unless pH is <7.0 due to risks of rebound alkalosis and cerebral edema. Increasing oxygen flow may be needed if SpO2 doesn't improve, but it's not primary. Diuretics are contraindicated due to existing severe dehydration from DKA.",
