He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Background: His CKD is long-standing, recently worsened. He has poorly controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessment: At 05:30, he reported muscle weakness and palpitations. At 05:45, vitals: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 37.2°C. Urine output was 20 mL last hour. Labs are concerning for hyperkalemia. He is alert and oriented x3 but anxious. Telemetry is monitoring for arrhythmias. Recommendation: I notified the provider about his condition and lab results. I request guidance on immediate interventions for possible hyperkalemia and decreased blood pressure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.",

        "correct": "The patient's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L, coupled with reported muscle weakness, palpitations, and potential telemetry changes, indicates severe hyperkalemia requiring immediate intervention. Administering IV insulin and glucose is the most immediate action to temporarily shift potassium into cells, mitigating the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage any arrhythmias resulting from hyperkalemia. Preparing for dialysis is a longer-term solution for potassium removal but not the immediate priority. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important to assess for cardiac changes related to hyperkalemia, but it is secondary to immediate treatment. Administering Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Kayexalate) is also appropriate but slower-acting than IV insulin/glucose in acutely lowering potassium levels. Lisinopril should be held due to AKI and hypotension.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying treatment of hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. While all options are relevant to the patient's care, some address the immediate threat to the patient's life more directly than others. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial, but after initial intervention. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is a good next step to assess for cardiac changes. Kayexalate is slower acting and not the immediate priority. Preparing the patient for dialysis is also important, but is not the first action to take, as it is a longer-term solution. Lisinopril should be held due to AKI and hypotension.",
