        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is: 1. Increase the IV fluid infusion rate. This addresses the hypovolemia, increasing preload and cardiac output. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial to counteract the decreased circulating volume caused by blood loss. 2. Apply oxygen via non-rebreather mask. The patient's SpO2 is declining, indicating inadequate oxygenation. A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen, maximizing oxygen delivery to tissues. 3. Notify the healthcare provider immediately. Report the patient's deteriorating condition and obtain further orders. Prompt communication ensures timely medical intervention and adjustments to the treatment plan. 4. Elevate the patient's legs. Elevating the legs promotes venous return, increasing preload and improving blood pressure. This maneuver aids in redistributing blood volume to the central circulation. 5. Monitor urine output hourly. This assesses the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and provides information about kidney perfusion. Adequate urine output indicates sufficient renal perfusion and overall hemodynamic stability.",
        "incorrect": "Administer morphine 2 mg IVP: While the patient reports pain, addressing hypovolemic shock is the priority. Pain management should be addressed after stabilizing hemodynamic status. Opioids can further decrease blood pressure. Obtain a 12-lead ECG: While a 12-lead ECG may be indicated to rule out cardiac causes of hypotension, it is not the immediate priority. The patient's history and presentation strongly suggest hypovolemic shock. Document the findings in the patient's chart: Documentation is important, but it is not a priority action when the patient is unstable and requires immediate intervention. Focus on stabilizing the patient first.",
