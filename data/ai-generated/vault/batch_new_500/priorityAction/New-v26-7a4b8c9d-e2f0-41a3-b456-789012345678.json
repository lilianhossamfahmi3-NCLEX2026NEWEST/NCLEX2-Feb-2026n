Procedure was uncomplicated. A: At 07:00, vital signs were: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 37.0°C. Patient is pale and diaphoretic. Dressing site has moderate serosanguinous drainage. Urine output via Foley catheter has been 30 mL in the last hour. The patient reports feeling increasingly weak and lightheaded. I noticed a significant amount of blood in the surgical drain. A new order for morphine 2mg IVP PRN pain was prescribed at 06:30, but not yet administered. R: I am concerned about possible hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss. I recommend immediate intervention to stabilize his condition.",

    "correct": "The correct order of interventions is: 1. Increase the IV fluid infusion rate. This addresses the hypovolemia and aims to increase preload and cardiac output. 2. Apply oxygen via non-rebreather mask. The patient's SpO2 is declining, indicating inadequate oxygenation. A non-rebreather mask provides a higher concentration of oxygen than a nasal cannula. 3. Notify the healthcare provider immediately. This is crucial to report the patient's deteriorating condition and obtain further orders. 4. Elevate the patient's legs. Elevating the legs promotes venous return and increases preload, which can help improve blood pressure. 5. Monitor urine output hourly. This assesses the effectiveness of the fluid resuscitation and provides information about kidney perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Administer morphine 2 mg IVP: While the patient may be experiencing pain, addressing the hypovolemic shock is the priority. Pain management should be addressed after stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status. Obtain a 12-lead ECG: While a 12-lead ECG may be indicated to rule out cardiac causes of hypotension, it is not the immediate priority in this scenario. The patient's history and presentation strongly suggest hypovolemic shock. Document the findings in the patient's chart: Documentation is important, but it is not a priority action when the patient is unstable and requires immediate intervention.",
