The low PaO2, high PaCO2, and low pH indicate worsening respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, requiring immediate oxygenation and ventilation adjustments. Obtaining a chest x-ray is crucial to rule out complications like pneumothorax. Consulting with the respiratory therapist and physician allows for collaborative decision-making regarding ventilator settings and potential proning. Increasing sedation can improve patient synchrony with the ventilator and reduce oxygen consumption. Drawing blood cultures is important to identify any underlying infection contributing to the ARDS; however, oxygenation and ventilation are the priority. Monitoring vital signs continuously allows for real-time assessment of the patient's response to interventions.",
