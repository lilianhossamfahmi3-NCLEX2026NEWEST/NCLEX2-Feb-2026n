            "correct": "1. Titrate Nicardipine IV drip: Rapidly lowering blood pressure is crucial to reducing cerebral edema and preventing further neurological damage. The SBP >160 mmHg needs immediate attention to prevent further increases in ICP and the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. ClinicalPearl: Aim for controlled reduction, not precipitous drops. 2. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees: This promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. Elevating the head of the bed is a fundamental nursing intervention for patients with increased ICP. ClinicalPearl: Ensure proper alignment to avoid neck compression, which can impede venous return. 3. Administer Acetaminophen: Elevated temperature increases metabolic demand in the brain, exacerbating ICP. Reducing fever is essential to minimize further neurological damage and improve patient outcomes. ClinicalPearl: Monitor for effectiveness and consider alternative routes if the patient's LOC decreases. 4. Decrease environmental stimuli: Minimizing external stimuli can help reduce agitation and prevent further increases in ICP. The patient is already restless and confused, which can further increase ICP. Reducing stimuli will help to calm the patient and prevent further exacerbation of ICP. ClinicalPearl: Cluster care activities to allow for periods of rest and reduced stimulation.",
            "incorrect": "Administering Acetaminophen before controlling the blood pressure is incorrect because uncontrolled hypertension contributes directly to increased ICP and potential hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of a stroke. Decreasing environmental stimuli should only be done AFTER addressing the hypertension, because the hypertension is causing the increase in ICP and addressing that is most important.",
