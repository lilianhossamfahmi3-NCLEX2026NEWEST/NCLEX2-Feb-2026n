    "sbar": "S: Jameson Riley, a 58-year-old male with a T4 spinal cord injury, was admitted yesterday for management of recurrent autonomic dysreflexia. At 07:30, he reported a severe headache and blurred vision. His blood pressure was 210/110 mmHg, and heart rate was 52 bpm.\n\nA: The patient has a history of neurogenic bowel, with his last bowel movement three days ago. He typically manages this at home using a bisacodyl suppository every other day. He is currently experiencing an episode of autonomic dysreflexia, likely triggered by bowel or bladder distention.\n\nB: Mr. Riley sustained his spinal cord injury at T4 ten years ago. He understands his condition and usually manages his bowel regimen independently at home. He has been compliant with his medications and bowel program prior to this admission.\n\nO: Currently, the patient is restless and diaphoretic. A Foley catheter is in place, draining clear yellow urine. Vital signs at 07:30: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 99.1°F (37.3°C). Orders include PRN hydralazine 10 mg IVP for SBP > 180 mmHg and digital rectal exam PRN for impaction. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO q4h PRN for headache. Current time is 07:45. The patient requires immediate intervention to address the autonomic dysreflexia episode.",

    "correct": "Administering hydralazine IVP is appropriate given the patient's elevated blood pressure (SBP > 180 mmHg) as per the PRN order. Checking the Foley catheter for kinks or obstructions is a critical initial step to rule out urinary retention as a cause of autonomic dysreflexia. Elevating the head of the bed helps to lower the blood pressure and reduce the severity of the headache. Contacting the physician is necessary if initial interventions are ineffective or if the patient's condition worsens despite treatment. Loosening restrictive clothing is crucial to reduce external stimuli that can exacerbate autonomic dysreflexia.",
    "incorrect": "Performing a digital rectal exam without first addressing other potential causes or administering medication could worsen the patient's condition and further elevate blood pressure. Digital rectal exams should be performed cautiously and only after other causes have been ruled out or treated. Administering acetaminophen is not the priority action because it does not directly address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia. Acetaminophen is for headache, a symptom, but not the primary problem.",
