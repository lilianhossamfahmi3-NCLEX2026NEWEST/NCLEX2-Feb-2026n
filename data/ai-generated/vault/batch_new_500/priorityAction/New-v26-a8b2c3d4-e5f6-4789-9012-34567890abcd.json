B: Mr. Smith was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for pneumonia and started on vent support due to increasing respiratory distress. His baseline ABGs were within acceptable parameters. Current vent settings at 06:00 are: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 14. A: At 07:30, I noted a decline. SpO2 is now 87%, heart rate 110 bpm, and blood pressure 90/50 mmHg. Breath sounds are diminished on the left side. Peak inspiratory pressure has increased from 25 cm H2O to 38 cm H2O. He appears anxious and is attempting to pull at his endotracheal tube. Last Propofol dose was at 07:00. R: I'm concerned about a possible pneumothorax or other acute respiratory issue. I need orders for immediate intervention, including a chest x-ray and potential adjustments to ventilator settings.",
