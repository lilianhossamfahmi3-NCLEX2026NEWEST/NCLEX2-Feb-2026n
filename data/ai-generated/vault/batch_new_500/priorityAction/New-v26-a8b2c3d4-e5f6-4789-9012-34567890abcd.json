B: He was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for pneumonia and started on vent support due to increasing respiratory distress. His baseline ABGs were within acceptable parameters. At 06:00, his vent settings are: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 14. A: At 07:30, I noticed his SpO2 has dropped to 87%, his heart rate is 110 bpm, and his blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg. His breath sounds are diminished on the left side. His peak inspiratory pressure has increased from 25 cm H2O to 38 cm H2O. He appears anxious and is attempting to pull at his endotracheal tube. His last dose of sedation (Propofol) was administered at 07:00. E: I'm concerned he may have a pneumothorax or another acute respiratory issue. I need orders for immediate intervention.",

    "correct": "The client is showing signs of a potential pneumothorax (diminished breath sounds on one side, increased peak inspiratory pressure, hypoxemia), as well as possible ventilator-induced lung injury or other complications. The immediate priorities are to ensure adequate oxygenation, rule out a pneumothorax, and optimize ventilator settings. 1. Auscultate breath sounds bilaterally: This helps confirm the presence and location of decreased or absent breath sounds, supporting the suspicion of a pneumothorax. 2. Notify the physician immediately: The client's condition requires urgent medical evaluation and intervention. 3. Prepare for possible chest x-ray: A chest x-ray is essential to confirm or rule out a pneumothorax. 4. Increase FiO2 as prescribed or per protocol: The client's SpO2 is significantly low, and increasing the FiO2 can help improve oxygenation while further interventions are being prepared.",
    "incorrect": "Assessing endotracheal tube placement is important, but it's unlikely the *most* immediate issue given the sudden change and unilateral breath sounds. Increasing sedation *may* be needed later, but addressing the potential respiratory compromise is paramount. Checking ventilator settings is important, but only *after* ensuring the client is adequately oxygenated and a pneumothorax has been ruled out. Turning the client to the unaffected side without knowing the cause of the respiratory distress could worsen the situation if a pneumothorax is present.",
