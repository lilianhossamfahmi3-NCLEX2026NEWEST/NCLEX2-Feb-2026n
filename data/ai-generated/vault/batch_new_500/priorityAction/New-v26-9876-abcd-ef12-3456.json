Blood pressure normalized postpartum initially but is now elevated. Background: Patient received magnesium sulfate during labor, which was discontinued 2 hours post delivery. Assessment: At 06:00, patient reports a mild headache and blurred vision. Fundus is firm at the umbilicus with moderate lochia rubra. Vitals: BP 152/98 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.1°C. Deep tendon reflexes are +2 bilaterally. Urine output since delivery is 150 mL. Lab results are pending but show proteinuria. Recommendation: The patient exhibits signs of postpartum preeclampsia. Please assess the patient comprehensively, including neurological status, and provide orders for potential interventions related to postpartum preeclampsia and possible postpartum hemorrhage risk. Consider administering antihypertensive medication per protocol and continue monitoring vital signs closely. Notify the provider immediately of assessment findings and interventions implemented.",

    "correct": "The priority nursing actions for a postpartum client with a history of preeclampsia and current elevated blood pressure and proteinuria involve preventing complications such as eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage. Administering antihypertensive medication is crucial to lower the blood pressure to a safe range. Monitoring neurological status assesses for worsening preeclampsia or signs of eclampsia, such as seizures. Initiating seizure precautions protects the client from injury if a seizure occurs. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential for further evaluation and potential medication adjustments. Weighing the client daily helps to monitor fluid retention, which is common in preeclampsia and can contribute to elevated blood pressure. Assessing lochia helps rule out postpartum hemorrhage.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding pain medication would unnecessarily cause discomfort and is not the priority with elevated BP. Encouraging ambulation without assessing the patient's stability could increase the risk of falls, especially with blurred vision. Increasing IV fluids can worsen fluid retention and exacerbate hypertension. Applying ice packs to the perineum addresses perineal pain/edema but is not a priority with elevated BP and risk for complications from preeclampsia. Assessing bowel sounds is not directly related to the immediate management of postpartum preeclampsia.",
