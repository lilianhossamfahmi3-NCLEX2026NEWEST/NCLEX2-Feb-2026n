A: History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent knee replacement surgery. B: Admitted yesterday at 18:00. Started on heparin per protocol. Baseline PTT within normal limits. R: 07:00 labs show PTT is currently 95 seconds (therapeutic range 60-80 seconds). Patient reports no bleeding, bruising, or other adverse effects. Vital signs stable: BP 150/90, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. 07:15 assessment reveals no new findings. Orders include holding heparin for PTT > 100 seconds and notifying the provider. The next PTT is scheduled for 13:00. Infusion started at 20:00 last night. Of note, the patient has developed a new productive cough with thick, yellow sputum. A chest X-ray is pending to rule out pneumonia. The patient denies any shortness of breath but is wearing oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L per minute.",

        "correct": "1. **Stop the heparin infusion immediately:** The client's PTT is elevated at 95 seconds, exceeding the therapeutic range of 60-80 seconds, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Holding the heparin infusion is the priority to prevent further anticoagulation. 2. **Notify the healthcare provider of the PTT result, heparin infusion status, and new respiratory symptoms:** The provider needs to be informed of the elevated PTT and the nurse's action of holding the heparin. Additionally, the new productive cough and pending chest X-ray results are crucial information. The provider can then determine if further intervention is needed, such as administering protamine sulfate (heparin antagonist), adjusting the heparin dose, or initiating antibiotic therapy. 3. **Initiate Airborne Precautions:** The patient's new productive cough with yellow sputum and pending chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia warrant initiation of Airborne Precautions while awaiting test results. This is essential to prevent potential spread of infection to other patients and staff.",
        "incorrect": "Reassessing the patient in 1 hour is not the priority. While ongoing monitoring is important, the immediate risk of bleeding due to the elevated PTT necessitates immediate action (stopping the infusion and notifying the provider). Documenting the findings is important, but it is not the priority action. The patient is at risk for bleeding. Increasing the IV fluids is not indicated. The patient's blood pressure and hydration status are not identified as a problem. Preparing to administer protamine sulfate is important, but it is secondary to stopping the infusion and notifying the provider.",
