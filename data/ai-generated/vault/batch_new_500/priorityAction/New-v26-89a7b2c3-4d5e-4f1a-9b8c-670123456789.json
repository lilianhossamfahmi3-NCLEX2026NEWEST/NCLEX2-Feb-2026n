        "correct": "1. Administer antihypertensive medication as prescribed: The patient's blood pressure is elevated (152/98 mmHg) and trending upwards, indicating a need for prompt intervention to prevent complications such as stroke or seizures. Elevated blood pressure postpartum in a patient with a history of preeclampsia can rapidly escalate to severe hypertension, increasing the risk of end-organ damage. *Clinical Pearl:* Prompt administration of antihypertensives can prevent severe complications. 2. Initiate magnesium sulfate infusion as prescribed: Given the history of preeclampsia, even without severe features currently, initiation of magnesium sulfate is crucial to prevent seizures, a major risk in the postpartum period. Magnesium sulfate acts as a central nervous system depressant, raising the seizure threshold. *Clinical Pearl:* Magnesium sulfate is the primary drug for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia. 3. Assess fundal tone and lochia: Assess every 15 minutes for hemorrhage. The patient's report of saturating a pad in one hour, combined with the slightly low hemoglobin, raises concerns about postpartum hemorrhage, necessitating a thorough assessment. A boggy fundus or excessive lochia indicates uterine atony, a major cause of postpartum hemorrhage. *Clinical Pearl:* Early detection of postpartum hemorrhage is crucial for timely intervention. 4. Monitor urinary output closely: Decreased urinary output (30mL in 2 hours) can be a sign of hypovolemia related to blood loss or a complication of preeclampsia affecting kidney function. Close monitoring is essential. Oliguria in the postpartum period can indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or renal compromise due to preeclampsia. *Clinical Pearl:* Urinary output is a key indicator of fluid balance and renal function. 5. Continue to monitor vital signs every 15 minutes: Frequent monitoring is crucial to detect any further deterioration in the patient's condition, especially given the elevated blood pressure and potential for postpartum hemorrhage. Continuous monitoring allows for early detection of trends and prompt intervention. *Clinical Pearl:* Frequent vital sign monitoring is essential in unstable postpartum patients. 6. Document all interventions and patient responses: Accurate and timely documentation is essential for effective communication among the healthcare team and to ensure continuity of care. Comprehensive documentation ensures that all healthcare providers are aware of the patient's status and interventions. *Clinical Pearl:* Accurate documentation is vital for patient safety and legal protection.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying administration of antihypertensives or magnesium sulfate could lead to severe complications such as stroke, seizures, or even death. Focusing solely on monitoring without active intervention puts the patient at significant risk. Inadequate assessment of fundal tone and lochia could result in a missed diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage, leading to further blood loss and potential hypovolemic shock. Neglecting to monitor urinary output may mask signs of hypovolemia or kidney dysfunction. Incomplete documentation can compromise patient safety and hinder effective communication among healthcare providers.",
