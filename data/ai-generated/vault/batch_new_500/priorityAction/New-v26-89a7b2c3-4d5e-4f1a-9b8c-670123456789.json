    "correct": "1. Administer antihypertensive medication as prescribed: The patient's blood pressure is elevated (152/98 mmHg) and trending upwards, indicating a need for prompt intervention to prevent complications such as stroke or seizures. 2. Initiate magnesium sulfate infusion as prescribed: Given the history of preeclampsia, even without severe features currently, initiation of magnesium sulfate is crucial to prevent seizures, a major risk in the postpartum period. 3. Assess fundal tone and lochia: Assess every 15 minutes for hemorrhage. The patient's report of saturating a pad in one hour, combined with the slightly low hemoglobin, raises concerns about postpartum hemorrhage, necessitating a thorough assessment. 4. Monitor urinary output closely: Decreased urinary output (30mL in 2 hours) can be a sign of hypovolemia related to blood loss or a complication of preeclampsia affecting kidney function. Close monitoring is essential. 5. Continue to monitor vital signs every 15 minutes: Frequent monitoring is crucial to detect any further deterioration in the patient's condition, especially given the elevated blood pressure and potential for postpartum hemorrhage. 6. Document all interventions and patient responses: Accurate and timely documentation is essential for effective communication among the healthcare team and to ensure continuity of care.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying administration of antihypertensives or magnesium sulfate could lead to severe complications such as stroke, seizures, or even death. Focusing solely on monitoring without active intervention puts the patient at significant risk. Inadequate assessment of fundal tone and lochia could result in a missed diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage, leading to further blood loss and potential hypovolemic shock. Neglecting to monitor urinary output may mask signs of hypovolemia or kidney dysfunction. Incomplete documentation can compromise patient safety and hinder effective communication among healthcare providers.",
