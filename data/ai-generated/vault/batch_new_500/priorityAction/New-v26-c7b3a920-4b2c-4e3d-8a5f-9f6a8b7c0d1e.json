    "sbar": "SITUATION: Four patients require urgent assessment and intervention based on recent clinical changes. BACKGROUND: Patient A is a 68-year-old male, admitted for Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome (HHS), currently managed with an insulin drip. Patient B is a 32-year-old female, postoperative day one following a thyroidectomy, reporting perioral tingling and muscle spasms. Patient C is a 17-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), presenting with suspected Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Patient D is a 55-year-old female, admitted for hyperthyroidism, currently experiencing palpitations and agitation. ASSESSMENT: At 0700, Patient A's blood glucose is 450 mg/dL, showing a downward trend. Patient B's serum calcium level is pending; she exhibits anxiety and intermittent muscle twitching. Patient C's blood glucose is 580 mg/dL, with Kussmaul respirations noted at 0715; he is lethargic. Patient D's heart rate is 120 bpm and regular at 0720; she also has a fine tremor. RECOMMENDATION: Please prioritize these patients based on their acuity and potential for rapid clinical deterioration. Consider the need for immediate interventions to stabilize each patient's condition.",

    "correct": "Patient C (DKA) is the highest priority due to the severely elevated glucose, acidosis (pH 7.20, HCO3 15), hypokalemia, and Kussmaul respirations, indicating the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis. This patient requires immediate intervention to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia, and acidosis. Patient D (Thyroid Storm) is the next highest priority. The elevated heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature, along with abnormal thyroid hormone levels, indicate a thyroid storm. This patient needs immediate intervention to prevent cardiac complications. Patient B (Post Thyroidectomy) is next. Tingling fingers suggest potential hypocalcemia post-thyroidectomy, requiring prompt assessment and calcium replacement if indicated. Patient A (HHS) is the lowest priority. While glucose is elevated, the patient is stable and trending down with insulin therapy.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect prioritization can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Reversing the order or misplacing patients can lead to poorer outcomes. For example, if Patient A is prioritized over Patient C, the DKA will worsen, leading to increased risk of cerebral edema, coma, and death. Prioritizing Patient B over Patient C can delay intervention for the DKA, leading to similar risks.",
