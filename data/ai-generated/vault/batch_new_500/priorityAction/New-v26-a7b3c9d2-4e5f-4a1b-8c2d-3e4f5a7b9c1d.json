For example, delaying continuous observation increases the risk of a completed suicide attempt. Initiating group therapy before ensuring the immediate safety of the patient and addressing acute anxiety is not appropriate. Omitting environmental safety checks could lead to the availability of means for self-harm. Delaying medication administration can prolong the patient's distress and increase the risk of suicidal behavior.",
