Suspect possible aspiration pneumonia due to his altered mental status and respiratory rate. Contact precautions initiated. Pending cultures. 0800 Labs: Ammonia 180 mcg/dL, INR 2.5, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, Sodium 130 mEq/L. 1430 Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, Temp 101.5°F (38.6°C). He attempted to climb out of bed at 1445. Physician notified of lab values and elevated temperature.

        "correct": "1. Administer the ordered fluid bolus of 500mL Normal Saline IV over 1 hour: The patient's BP of 90/60 mmHg indicates hypotension, likely due to fluid shifts related to ascites and decreased oncotic pressure from liver failure. Rapidly addressing this hypotension is critical to maintain perfusion to vital organs. 2. Implement safety precautions due to altered mental status: The patient is confused and attempted to climb out of bed, indicating a high risk for falls. Patient safety is a priority. 3. Initiate Airborne Precautions: Given the patient's elevated temperature, respiratory rate, and altered mental status, there is a concern for potential respiratory infection (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, especially given his history). Implementing airborne precautions is crucial to prevent the spread of possible airborne pathogens while awaiting culture results. 4. Administer acetaminophen 650mg PO PRN fever: The patient's temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C) indicates a fever. Addressing the fever is important, but secondary to immediately life-threatening issues. 5. Continue administering lactulose as prescribed: Lactulose helps reduce ammonia levels, but addressing the immediate threats to patient safety is more critical. While important for long-term management, it's the lowest priority in this acute situation.",
