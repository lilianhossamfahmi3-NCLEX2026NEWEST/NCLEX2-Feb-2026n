B: She has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She takes oral hypoglycemics, but has not been compliant recently due to feeling unwell. A: On admission at 03:00, her blood glucose was 875 mg/dL, serum osmolality 340 mOsm/kg, and she was severely dehydrated. Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 28 and deep, Temp 97.8°F (36.6°C), SpO2 94% on room air. She is lethargic but arousable to painful stimuli. Urine output minimal in the ED. R: I have initiated IV fluids (0.9% NS) at 500 mL/hr per protocol. I am concerned about her dehydration and potential for cerebral edema. Labs are pending. The physician was notified at 03:15 and ordered an insulin drip to start at 04:00 at 2 units/hr.",

Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring due to the risk of dysrhythmias from electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia. 2. Administer potassium chloride (KCl) as prescribed, given the patient's low potassium level (3.0 mEq/L). Hypokalemia is common in HHS and can be life-threatening. 3. Start the insulin infusion at the prescribed rate (2 units/hr). Insulin is crucial to reduce the elevated blood glucose levels and correct the hyperosmolar state. 4. Continue IV fluid resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline at the prescribed rate (500 mL/hr). Rehydration is vital to correct the fluid deficit and improve perfusion. 5. Monitor the patient's neurological status frequently. HHS can lead to cerebral edema, especially during rapid correction of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality.",
