    "correct": "1. Ensure continuous observation: The patient is on suicide precautions and exhibiting agitation, requiring constant monitoring to prevent self-harm. 2. Maintain patient safety by ensuring restraints are correctly applied: Restraints are in place due to agitation, so correct application and monitoring are crucial to prevent injury. 3. Administer PRN lorazepam as prescribed: The patient received lorazepam at 06:00. If agitation persists, another dose may be indicated to manage anxiety and prevent escalation. 4. Document the patient's behavior and interventions: Accurate and timely documentation provides a record of the patient's condition, interventions, and responses, which is essential for continuity of care. 5. Collaborate with the mental health team to review the care plan: Given the patient's imminent risk and ongoing distress, consulting with the psychiatrist and other team members is essential to refine the treatment strategy.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding fluids to prevent additional overdose is not appropriate, as the patient requires hydration and medication administration for the acetaminophen overdose. Encouraging the patient to verbalize feelings is appropriate but not the *first* action when the patient is actively agitated and at imminent risk. Initiating discharge planning is premature and inappropriate at this stage, as the patient is acutely suicidal and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. Removing restraints immediately is unsafe as the patient continues to exhibit agitation and is at risk of self-harm. Encouraging the patient to eat a meal can be considered later, but is not the priority when the patient is actively suicidal and agitated.",
