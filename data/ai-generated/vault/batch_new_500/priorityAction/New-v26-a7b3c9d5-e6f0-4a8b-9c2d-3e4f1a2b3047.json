B: He has a history of major depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder. He reports feelings of hopelessness related to recent job loss and a breakup with his partner. Found by his roommate. A: On admission, the patient was alert but highly anxious. Initial vitals at 03:30: BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 99.0°F (37.2°C). Acetaminophen level was elevated, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was initiated. Continuous observation and suicide precautions are in place. He is currently in restraints due to agitation. R: Continue to monitor vitals, administer scheduled medications, and provide supportive care. A mental status evaluation is scheduled for 09:00. Monitor for escalating agitation and suicidal ideation.",

        "correct": "1. Ensure continuous observation: The patient is on suicide precautions and exhibiting agitation, requiring constant monitoring to prevent self-harm. Continuous observation is the highest priority to prevent any immediate attempts at self-harm. 2. Verify correct application of restraints: Restraints are in place due to agitation; ensure they are correctly applied and monitored to prevent injury and maintain patient safety. Improperly applied restraints can cause physical harm or increase agitation. 3. Administer PRN lorazepam as prescribed: The patient received lorazepam at 06:00. If agitation persists (as indicated in the SBAR), another dose may be indicated to manage anxiety and prevent escalation. Lorazepam helps to reduce anxiety and agitation, decreasing the risk of self-harm. 4. Document the patient's behavior and interventions: Accurate and timely documentation provides a record of the patient's condition, interventions, and responses, which is essential for continuity of care and legal protection. Documentation should include the patient's mental status, vital signs, medications administered, and any interventions taken. 5. Collaborate with the mental health team to review the care plan: Given the patient's imminent risk and ongoing distress, consulting with the psychiatrist and other team members is essential to refine the treatment strategy. A multidisciplinary approach ensures comprehensive care and addresses all aspects of the patient's condition.",
        "incorrect": "Withholding fluids to prevent additional overdose is not appropriate, as the patient requires hydration and medication administration for the acetaminophen overdose. Hydration is essential for the patient's overall well-being and to aid in the excretion of acetaminophen metabolites. Encouraging the patient to verbalize feelings is appropriate but not the *first* action when the patient is actively agitated and at imminent risk. While therapeutic communication is important, immediate safety concerns take precedence. Initiating discharge planning is premature and inappropriate at this stage, as the patient is acutely suicidal and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. Discharge planning should only occur when the patient is stable and no longer at immediate risk. Removing restraints immediately is unsafe as the patient continues to exhibit agitation and is at risk of self-harm. Restraints should only be removed when the patient is calm and no longer poses a threat to themselves or others. Encouraging the patient to eat a meal can be considered later, but is not the priority when the patient is actively suicidal and agitated. Nutritional needs can be addressed once the patient's immediate safety is ensured.",
