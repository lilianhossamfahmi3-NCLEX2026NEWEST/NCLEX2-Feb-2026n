History of chronic alcohol use.\nB: Patient presented to ED with epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated amylase and lipase levels. CT scan confirmed pancreatic inflammation. Vital signs stable upon admission to Med-Surg. Last alcohol intake reported 24 hours prior.\nA: Patient is currently on NPO status. IV fluids (Lactated Ringers) infusing at 125 mL/hr. Morphine 4mg IV q2h PRN for pain. Frequent vomiting episodes. Abdomen distended and tender to palpation. Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Foley catheter in place, urine output minimal.\nR: Continue current orders. Monitor vital signs and abdominal status closely. Consider nasogastric tube insertion if vomiting persists. Consult gastroenterology. Monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal. Pain control is paramount. Anticipate repeat lab draws at 12:00.",

    "correct": "1. Administer prescribed pain medication (Morphine 4mg IV): Addressing the patient's severe pain is a priority. Pancreatitis pain is excruciating and must be managed to reduce stress and promote healing. 2. Monitor vital signs closely, especially heart rate and blood pressure: Tachycardia and hypotension can indicate hypovolemia or developing complications like shock. Frequent monitoring allows for early intervention. 3. Assess and document abdominal distension and tenderness: Abdominal assessment provides information about the progression of the pancreatitis and potential complications like ascites or ileus. 4. Administer prescribed antiemetic (Ondansetron 4mg IV PRN): Reducing nausea and vomiting is crucial to prevent further fluid and electrolyte loss and improve patient comfort. 5. Monitor serum electrolytes, glucose, BUN, and creatinine levels: These labs help assess the severity of pancreatitis, identify electrolyte imbalances, and monitor kidney function, all of which can be affected by pancreatitis.",
    "incorrect": "Withholding pain medication would be unethical and detrimental to the patient's well-being. Ignoring vital signs would delay the detection of potentially life-threatening complications. Neglecting abdominal assessment would prevent the early identification of complications. Failing to address nausea and vomiting would exacerbate fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Omitting lab monitoring would hinder the assessment of the patient's overall condition and response to treatment.",
