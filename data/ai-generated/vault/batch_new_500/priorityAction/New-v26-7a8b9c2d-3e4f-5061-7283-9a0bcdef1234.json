        "correct": "The patient is experiencing a life-threatening combination of hyperkalemia, acidosis, and potential pulmonary edema. Administering calcium gluconate is the immediate priority to stabilize the cardiac membrane against the effects of hyperkalemia, preventing arrhythmias. Increasing oxygen delivery is crucial to address the hypoxemia and increased work of breathing, improving oxygen saturation. Administering sodium bicarbonate addresses the metabolic acidosis, improving pH, and shifting potassium intracellularly, thus reducing serum potassium levels. Administering regular insulin shifts potassium into the cells, further helping to lower serum potassium levels. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage arrhythmias resulting from hyperkalemia, allowing for prompt intervention.",
        "incorrect": "While Kayexalate helps remove potassium from the body, it is not a rapid-acting treatment and is not suitable for an acute hyperkalemic crisis where immediate stabilization is needed. Monitoring urine output is important for assessing renal function but is not the immediate priority in this unstable situation requiring rapid intervention. Elevating the head of the bed and encouraging deep breathing can help with dyspnea but do not address the underlying electrolyte imbalances or acidosis causing the respiratory distress. Notifying the provider has already occurred as evidenced by the medication orders; the nurse must now implement those orders. Reassuring the patient and family is important for psychosocial support, but physiological stabilization is the immediate priority to ensure patient survival. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is useful for further evaluation, but the immediate action is to protect the myocardium with calcium gluconate to prevent cardiac arrest.",
