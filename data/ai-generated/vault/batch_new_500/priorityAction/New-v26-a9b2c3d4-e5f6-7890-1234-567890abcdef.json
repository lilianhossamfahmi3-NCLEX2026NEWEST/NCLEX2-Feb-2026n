Increase the FiO2: The patient's PaO2 is slightly below the target range, and the SpO2 is suboptimal, indicating a need for increased oxygen delivery to improve oxygenation. This directly addresses hypoxemia.\n2. Suction the patient's airway: Coarse crackles and a history of thick secretions indicate retained secretions, impairing gas exchange and contributing to hypoxemia and elevated PaCO2. Suctioning clears the airway, improving ventilation.\n3. Notify the physician of the ABG results: The patient is experiencing respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2). While immediate actions are needed, the physician needs to be informed to evaluate the patient and implement further changes, such as adjusting ventilator settings or addressing underlying causes.",
            "incorrect": "Administer ceftriaxone: While the patient has pneumonia and ceftriaxone is ordered, addressing the acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia is the immediate priority. Antibiotic administration is important but not the most urgent action in this moment.\nIncrease the propofol infusion rate: While agitation is present, increasing sedation without addressing the underlying respiratory issues can worsen the patient's condition by further suppressing respiratory drive and potentially leading to increased PaCO2, exacerbating the acidosis.\nReposition the patient: While repositioning can help with lung expansion and secretion mobilization, it is less critical than ensuring adequate oxygenation and clearing the airway. It should be considered after the more critical interventions are addressed.",
