A: Currently, Mr. Jones reports no chest pain or shortness of breath. His apical pulse is irregularly irregular at 96 bpm. He appears anxious and verbalizes concerns about his heart rhythm. His current weight is 75 kg. O: The heparin infusion is running at the ordered rate. The latest PTT is 110 seconds (therapeutic range 60-80 seconds). His INR is 1.1. Vital signs at 07:00: BP 160/90, HR 96, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. The telemetry monitor shows persistent atrial fibrillation.",

    "correct": "The patient's PTT is significantly elevated (110 seconds), indicating that the heparin level is too high, and the patient is at increased risk for bleeding. The FIRST action should be to immediately decrease or temporarily stop the heparin infusion per institutional protocol or physician order to prevent further anticoagulation and potential bleeding complications. The elevated BP should be addressed soon, but immediately addressing the PTT is the higher priority as it poses a more immediate risk. Contacting the provider is necessary, but after adjusting the heparin infusion. Monitoring the patient is always important, but in this case, active intervention is required.",
    "incorrect": "Contacting the healthcare provider is important but should occur AFTER the nurse has taken immediate action to address the dangerously elevated PTT. Increasing the metoprolol dose might be considered for blood pressure control, but is not the priority given the elevated PTT and risk of bleeding. Monitoring the patient's vital signs more frequently is a reasonable action, but does not address the immediate risk of bleeding due to the supratherapeutic PTT level. It would be done in conjunction with decreasing the heparin.",
