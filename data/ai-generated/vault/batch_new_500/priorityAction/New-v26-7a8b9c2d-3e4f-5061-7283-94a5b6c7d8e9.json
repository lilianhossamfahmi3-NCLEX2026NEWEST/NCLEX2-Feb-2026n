Vancomycin is the antibiotic of choice for MRSA infections, and prompt administration is essential to combat the infection. 3. Obtain arterial blood gas (ABG). ABG analysis provides critical information about the patient's respiratory and metabolic status, guiding further interventions. 4. Monitor urine output hourly. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess renal perfusion and the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. 5. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Elevating the head of the bed can improve respiratory effort and oxygenation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering antibiotics before fluid resuscitation can be detrimental if the patient is severely hypotensive, as adequate circulation is needed for the drug to reach the affected tissues. Delaying ABG analysis delays assessment of the patient's acid-base balance and oxygenation status, critical in managing septic shock. Waiting to monitor urine output delays assessment of renal perfusion. Elevating the head of the bed should follow initial interventions to optimize hemodynamics and oxygenation. Although important, these actions are not the immediate priority.",
