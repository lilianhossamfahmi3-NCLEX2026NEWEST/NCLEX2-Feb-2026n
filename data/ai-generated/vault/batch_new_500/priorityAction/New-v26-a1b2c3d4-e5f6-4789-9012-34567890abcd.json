Removing potentially dangerous items from the client's environment is essential to prevent access to means of self-harm.

Notifying the mental health crisis team facilitates a comprehensive assessment and development of a safety plan, involving appropriate support systems.",

Focusing solely on the acetaminophen overdose ignores the underlying psychiatric condition and risk of future attempts.",
