Moderate vaginal bleeding with clots. Fundus is boggy, 2 cm above the umbilicus, and deviated to the right. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. The patient complains of a headache and blurred vision. She received a 2g Magnesium Sulfate IV loading dose during labor and is currently on a maintenance dose of 1g/hr. Last void was at 09:00, with 100 mL output. Labs show elevated AST/ALT, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia. R: Continue to monitor blood pressure closely, assess for signs of magnesium toxicity, manage fundal tone and bleeding, monitor intake and output, and address headache and visual disturbances. Contact the provider for blood pressure >160/110 despite interventions.",

        "correct": "1. Administer Labetalol 20mg IV per PRN order: The patient's blood pressure is consistently above 160/100 mmHg, indicating severe hypertension. Rapid control of blood pressure is crucial to prevent complications such as stroke, eclampsia, or heart failure. Labetalol is an appropriate first-line antihypertensive in this situation.\n2. Massage the fundus and assess for bladder distention: A boggy fundus and deviated uterus suggest uterine atony, a primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Massaging the fundus stimulates uterine contraction to control bleeding. Assessing for bladder distention is important because a full bladder can prevent the uterus from contracting effectively.\n3. Assess for signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity: The patient is receiving magnesium sulfate, which can lead to toxicity, especially with impaired renal function (elevated creatinine). Signs of toxicity include decreased respiratory rate, absent deep tendon reflexes, and altered mental status. Monitoring is essential to prevent respiratory depression or cardiac arrest.\n4. Initiate airborne isolation precautions: The patient has an airborne condition requiring immediate isolation to prevent the spread of infection to other patients and staff. While important, this is lower priority than addressing the immediate threats of hypertension, hemorrhage, and magnesium toxicity.",

Delaying antihypertensive administration in the face of severe hypertension or failing to address uterine atony promptly can lead to serious adverse outcomes.
