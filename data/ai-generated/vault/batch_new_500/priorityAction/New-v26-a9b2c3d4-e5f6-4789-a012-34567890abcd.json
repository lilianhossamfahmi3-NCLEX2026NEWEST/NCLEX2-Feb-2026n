He takes warfarin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. O: At 10:00, the patient is alert but confused, GCS 13 (E3, V4, M6). Significant right-sided weakness is present. BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 98 bpm and irregular, RR 22, SpO2 94% on room air. Labs show INR 2.8 and Glucose 160 mg/dL. A: Suspected acute ischemic stroke with possible aspiration risk. Critically elevated blood pressure increases the risk for hemorrhagic conversion and further neurological damage. Confusion and history of pneumonia raise concerns about potential infection. Immediate intervention is needed to manage blood pressure, prevent aspiration, and assess for infection.",

            "correct": "1. Administer Labetalol 20mg IV per PRN order. Rationale: The patient's critically elevated blood pressure (180/100 mmHg) poses an immediate threat of hemorrhagic conversion and further neurological damage. Rapidly lowering the blood pressure is crucial to prevent further complications. The PRN order for labetalol is specifically indicated to address this hypertensive crisis, making it the highest priority.\n2. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Rationale: Elevating the head of the bed facilitates venous drainage from the brain, helping to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP). This is a standard nursing intervention for patients at risk for increased ICP following a stroke. It also aids in preventing aspiration.\n3. Initiate swallow precautions and assess gag reflex. Rationale: Due to the patient's stroke and slurred speech, there is a high risk of aspiration. Assessing the gag reflex and initiating swallow precautions are essential to prevent aspiration pneumonia, a common and serious complication post-stroke. This ensures patient safety during any oral intake.\n4. Monitor neurological status and vital signs every 15 minutes. Rationale: Frequent neurological and vital sign monitoring is crucial to detect any deterioration in the patient's condition, such as worsening neurological deficits, signs of increased ICP, or changes in respiratory status. This allows for timely intervention and adjustment of the care plan.\n5. Consult with speech therapy for a formal swallow evaluation. Rationale: While important for long-term management, a formal swallow evaluation by speech therapy is not the immediate priority. It will help determine the patient's ability to safely swallow and guide dietary modifications and swallowing strategies, but addressing the immediate threats to the patient's well-being takes precedence.",
            "incorrect": "Delaying administration of antihypertensive medication can lead to irreversible neurological damage. Failing to elevate the head of the bed can exacerbate increased ICP and increase the risk of aspiration. Neglecting swallow precautions increases the risk of life-threatening aspiration. Infrequent monitoring can result in delayed detection of critical changes in neurological status. Consulting speech therapy, while essential, is not the most immediate life-saving intervention.",
