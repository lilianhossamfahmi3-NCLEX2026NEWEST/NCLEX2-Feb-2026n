Current assessment reveals jaundice, abdominal distension, and altered mental status. Labs show elevated AST (2500 U/L), ALT (3000 U/L), INR of 3.5, and ammonia level of 180 mcg/dL. Patient is currently receiving IV fluids at 100 mL/hr. Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 38.5°C. The provider has ordered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IV loading dose followed by continuous infusion. Lactulose 30 mL PO every 6 hours PRN for elevated ammonia. Monitor for signs of bleeding and encephalopathy. Anticipate possible transfer to liver transplant center. Patient is confused and restless. Please continue frequent neuro checks and liver function monitoring.",

Monitor neurological status frequently: Elevated ammonia levels can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Closely monitor for changes in mental status, tremors, and asterixis. Initiate bleeding precautions: Liver failure impairs clotting factor synthesis, increasing the risk of bleeding. Implement measures such as using soft toothbrushes and avoiding IM injections if possible. Prepare for possible transfer to a liver transplant center: Given the severity of the liver failure, the patient may require a liver transplant evaluation.",

Increase the IV fluid rate: While maintaining hydration is important, rapidly increasing the fluid rate could exacerbate ascites and electrolyte imbalances in a patient with compromised liver function. Encourage ambulation: The patient's current condition (altered mental status, hypotension) makes ambulation unsafe. Assess bowel sounds every 4 hours: While monitoring bowel function is important, it is not a priority in the immediate management of acute liver failure.",
