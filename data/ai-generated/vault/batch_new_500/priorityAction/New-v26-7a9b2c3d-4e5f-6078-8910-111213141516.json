Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC, Temp 38.5°C. Provider ordered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IV loading dose, followed by continuous infusion, and lactulose 30 mL PO q6h PRN for elevated ammonia. Monitor for bleeding and encephalopathy. Anticipate possible transfer to liver transplant center. Patient is confused and restless. Continue frequent neuro checks and liver function monitoring.",

        "correct": "Administer the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) loading dose as ordered: NAC is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose, replenishing glutathione stores and preventing further liver damage by binding to the toxic metabolite NAPQI. Monitor neurological status frequently: Elevated ammonia levels, a consequence of liver failure, can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Closely monitor for changes in mental status, tremors, and asterixis. Initiate bleeding precautions: Liver failure impairs the synthesis of clotting factors, increasing the risk of bleeding. Implement measures such as using soft toothbrushes and avoiding IM injections if possible. Prepare for possible transfer to a liver transplant center: Given the severity of the liver failure, indicated by significantly elevated liver enzymes and INR, the patient may require a liver transplant evaluation. This ensures timely access to specialized care if the patient's condition deteriorates.",
        "incorrect": "Administer docusate sodium: While constipation is a common issue, addressing the acute liver failure and its immediate complications takes priority. Docusate sodium can be administered later once the patient is stabilized. Increase the IV fluid rate: While maintaining hydration is important, rapidly increasing the fluid rate could exacerbate ascites and electrolyte imbalances in a patient with compromised liver function. The current rate should be carefully evaluated based on the patient's fluid status and urine output. Encourage ambulation: The patient's current condition (altered mental status, hypotension) makes ambulation unsafe and could lead to falls or further complications. Assess bowel sounds every 4 hours: While monitoring bowel function is important, it is not a priority in the immediate management of acute liver failure. Addressing the life-threatening complications of liver failure takes precedence.",
