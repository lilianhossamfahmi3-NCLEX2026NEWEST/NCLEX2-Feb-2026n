Troponin I level is elevated. B: Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He reports a family history of heart disease. Onset of chest pain was around 06:30 this morning. A: Currently, at 09:30, the patient is complaining of ongoing chest pain, rated 6/10. Vital signs are BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 20 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula. He appears pale and diaphoretic. The patient received morphine 2mg IV at 09:00 with minimal relief. R: I am concerned about cardiogenic shock given his hypotension, bradycardia, and ongoing chest pain post-morphine administration. I recommend immediate intervention to improve cardiac output and relieve pain. The cardiologist has been notified.",

    "correct": "1. Administer atropine 0.5 mg IV: The patient's bradycardia (HR 52 bpm) is contributing to the hypotension and reduced cardiac output. Atropine, an anticholinergic, will increase the heart rate by blocking the effects of the vagus nerve on the heart's sinoatrial (SA) node. 2. Prepare for transcutaneous pacing: If atropine is ineffective in raising the heart rate, external pacing is the next step to provide immediate electrical stimulation to the heart to increase cardiac output. 3. Elevate the patient's legs: Elevating the legs promotes venous return, which increases preload and subsequently improves cardiac output. This is a non-invasive method to temporarily improve hemodynamics. 4. Notify the provider of the patient's condition and interventions: Keeping the provider informed ensures timely adjustments to the treatment plan and allows for further interventions if needed. 5. Prepare for fluid bolus administration: Hypotension in the setting of acute MI can be due to cardiogenic shock or right ventricular infarct. After addressing the bradycardia, judicious fluid administration may be considered to improve preload and blood pressure, but only after assessing for signs of pulmonary congestion, as over-hydration can worsen heart failure. This is the last action because of the risk of worsening heart failure. ",
    "incorrect": "Reordering the actions will lead to suboptimal patient outcomes. Failing to address the bradycardia promptly will prevent improvement in cardiac output. Delaying notification to the provider may result in delayed interventions. Administering fluids without addressing bradycardia may worsen the patient's condition if the patient has underlying heart failure or right ventricular infarct.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In acute MI, bradycardia can significantly compromise cardiac output, leading to hypotension and decreased tissue perfusion.",
      "Atropine is the first-line treatment for symptomatic bradycardia.",
      "Transcutaneous pacing is a temporizing measure until a more definitive treatment, such as a transvenous pacemaker, can be implemented.",
      "Fluid boluses should be administered cautiously in patients with acute MI and hypotension, especially in the presence of heart failure, to avoid pulmonary edema."

    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "Many students might choose to administer fluids first due to the hypotension. However, addressing the bradycardia is crucial as the low heart rate is significantly contributing to the low blood pressure. Also, administering fluids before ruling out right ventricular infarct or assessing for pulmonary congestion can be dangerous.",
      "howToOvercome": "Carefully assess the patient's overall clinical picture, including heart rate, blood pressure, and potential underlying causes of hypotension. Prioritize interventions based on the most immediate threat to the patient's hemodynamic stability. Consider the potential risks of fluid administration in patients with heart failure or right ventricular infarct."
