He is NPO, and IV fluids are infusing at 125 mL/hr. A 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia. His history includes chronic alcohol abuse and hypertension. At 0900, amylase was 1800 U/L (normal 30-110 U/L), and lipase was 2500 U/L (normal 0-160 U/L). Potassium is 3.2 mEq/L, calcium is 7.8 mg/dL, and magnesium is 1.4 mEq/L. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. A Foley catheter is in place, with urine output at 30 mL/hr. The patient is confused and disoriented to place and time but oriented to person. Vitals at 1445: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, Temp 37.9°C (100.2°F). Elevated WBC suggests a possible infectious process.",
