His current ventilator settings are: FiO2 60%, PEEP 8 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. An ABG drawn at 1430 reveals: pH 7.28, PaCO2 65 mmHg, PaO2 90 mmHg, HCO3 26 mEq/L, and SaO2 94%. At 1445, the patient was noted to be increasingly agitated and exhibiting asynchronous breathing patterns. His current vital signs are: HR 110 bpm, BP 150/90 mmHg. He received lorazepam 1 mg IV at 1300 for agitation. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally, and tracheal secretions are thick and tenacious. The end-tidal CO2 is trending upward, and the high-pressure alarm on the ventilator has sounded twice in the past hour. The patient is also diaphoretic. Consider the ABG results and the patient's current status when prioritizing interventions.",

        "correct": "The patient is demonstrating clear signs of respiratory acidosis (pH 7.28, PaCO2 65 mmHg) and ventilator asynchrony, likely related to the COPD exacerbation and thick secretions. The increased agitation, elevated BP, and rising end-tidal CO2 further indicate inadequate ventilation and potential discomfort. Immediate suctioning is critical to clear the airway of thick, tenacious secretions, which are contributing to the high-pressure alarm and impaired gas exchange. Increasing sedation with lorazepam is necessary to address the agitation, promote synchrony with the ventilator, and reduce oxygen consumption and work of breathing. Adjusting ventilator settings, specifically increasing the tidal volume or respiratory rate (after consulting with the provider or per protocol), will help to improve ventilation and lower the PaCO2. Finally, verifying the ET tube placement is essential to ensure that the tube has not migrated, which could lead to unilateral breath sounds and inadequate ventilation. These actions directly address the patient's respiratory distress and aim to improve oxygenation and ventilation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of normal saline is not the immediate priority. While hydration is important, addressing the respiratory acidosis and ventilator asynchrony takes precedence. Increasing the FiO2 is not the primary intervention, as the PaO2 is within an acceptable range at 90%. The priority is to correct the hypercapnia. Notifying the respiratory therapist is an appropriate action but not the immediate priority; the RN must initiate interventions without delay. Encouraging deep breathing is not possible, as the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.",
