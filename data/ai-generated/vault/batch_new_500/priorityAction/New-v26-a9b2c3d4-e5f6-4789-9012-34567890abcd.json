            "correct": "The patient exhibits respiratory acidosis (pH 7.28, PaCO2 65 mmHg) and ventilator asynchrony, likely due to COPD exacerbation and thick secretions. Agitation, elevated BP, and rising end-tidal CO2 indicate inadequate ventilation and discomfort. Immediate suctioning clears thick, tenacious secretions, addressing the high-pressure alarm and impaired gas exchange. Increasing sedation with lorazepam promotes ventilator synchrony, reducing oxygen consumption and work of breathing. Adjusting ventilator settings (increasing tidal volume or respiratory rate, per provider order/protocol) improves ventilation and lowers PaCO2. Verifying ET tube placement ensures proper tube position, preventing unilateral breath sounds and inadequate ventilation. These actions directly address respiratory distress, improving oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nclinicalPearl: Ventilator asynchrony increases the work of breathing, causes patient discomfort, and can lead to lung injury. Thick secretions can obstruct the airway, increasing airway pressure and impairing gas exchange, thus worsening respiratory status. Respiratory acidosis requires prompt intervention focused on improving ventilation to correct the underlying cause of the acidosis.",
            "incorrect": "Administering a bolus of normal saline is not the immediate priority; addressing respiratory acidosis and ventilator asynchrony takes precedence. Increasing FiO2 isn't the primary intervention, as PaO2 is acceptable at 90%; correcting hypercapnia is key. Notifying the respiratory therapist is appropriate but not the immediate priority; the RN must initiate interventions without delay. Encouraging deep breathing is impossible due to intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\nquestionTrap: The question trap involves focusing on isolated symptoms, such as agitation, without considering the broader clinical picture of respiratory acidosis and ventilator asynchrony. Some options might seem reasonable in isolation but fail to address the underlying cause of the problem. Prioritize interventions that address the underlying respiratory acidosis and ventilator asynchrony, carefully considering the ABG results, ventilator settings, and the patient's overall clinical presentation. Focus on interventions that directly improve ventilation and oxygenation, rather than simply masking symptoms.",
