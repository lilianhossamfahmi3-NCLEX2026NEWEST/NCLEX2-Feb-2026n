His oxygen saturation has been declining despite increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). His current vital signs include a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute and labored. His temperature is 38.8°C. An arterial blood gas (ABG) at 0600 revealed a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2 of 58 mmHg while on FiO2 of 60%.\n\nB: Mr. Tyrell has a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent influenza infection. He was admitted from home.\n\nA: The patient is exhibiting worsening respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, suggestive of possible ARDS. Current orders include oxygen titration, antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin), and continuous cardiac monitoring.\n\nR: I recommend contacting the provider STAT to discuss the possibility of intubation and mechanical ventilation given his deteriorating respiratory status and ABG results. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is crucial. Be prepared for a potential code situation and ensure all necessary equipment is readily available.",
