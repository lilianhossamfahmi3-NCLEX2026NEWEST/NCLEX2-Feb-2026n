B: History of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Patient was on warfarin prior to admission, increasing risk of bleeding. A: At 07:00, patient's BP is critically elevated at 180/100 mmHg, HR is bradycardic at 55 bpm, RR is decreased to 10, and SpO2 is 92% on 2L NC. Neuro assessment reveals new onset of left-sided weakness and a sluggish pupillary response on the right, concerning for increased intracranial pressure. The latest ICP reading at 06:30 was 22 mmHg, above the normal range. Patient received mannitol 25g IV at 06:45. EVD in place, draining approximately 15 mL/hr of CSF. Suspect possible aspiration pneumonia due to decreased LOC and recent stroke. O: Notify neurosurgeon immediately to report significant status change and discuss further management. Prepare to administer Labetalol 10mg IV per order. Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage. Continue close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status every hour, including ICP and EVD output, and assess for signs of respiratory distress. Obtain a sputum sample for culture and sensitivity to rule out infection.",

        "correct": "1. Notify the neurosurgeon immediately: The patient's increasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate and respiratory rate, sluggish pupillary response, and elevated ICP indicate a potential neurological emergency requiring immediate intervention from the neurosurgeon. 2. Administer Labetalol 10mg IV: The blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg is significantly elevated and requires immediate management. Labetalol is prescribed PRN for SBP >160. 3. Continue Mannitol as prescribed: Mannitol helps to reduce ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, however, the neurosurgeon needs to be notified first. 4. Monitor neurological status including ICP and EVD output: Continuous monitoring is crucial to assess the patient's response to interventions and detect any further deterioration. 5. Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees: Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which can help to reduce ICP. This is a basic intervention but less urgent than addressing the elevated BP and notifying the physician.",
        "incorrect": "Reordering the actions will lead to a less effective and potentially harmful response to the patient's critical condition. Delaying notification of the neurosurgeon can result in a delay in necessary interventions. Failing to address the elevated blood pressure promptly can exacerbate the intracranial pressure and lead to further neurological damage. Prioritizing monitoring or head elevation before addressing the blood pressure and notifying the neurosurgeon delays critical treatment.",
