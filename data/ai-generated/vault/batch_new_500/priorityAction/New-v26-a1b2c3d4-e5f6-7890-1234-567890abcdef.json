Received thrombolytics in the ED at 08:30. ASSESSMENT: At 10:00, patient reports increasing shortness of breath, chest pain radiating to the left arm. BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 32, SpO2 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Crackles auscultated bilaterally. Patient is anxious and diaphoretic. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. Urine output 20 mL/hr. Current medications: Aspirin, Metoprolol, Atorvastatin. New order for morphine 2mg IV PRN for chest pain. The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. He is restless and increasingly anxious. RECOMMENDATION: I am concerned about potential cardiogenic shock and request immediate intervention. Should we prepare for intubation and vasopressor support?",

    "correct": "The priority is to improve oxygenation and perfusion. 1. Increase oxygen delivery: The patient's SpO2 is low (88%). Increasing oxygen delivery is crucial. 2. Elevate the head of the bed: This promotes lung expansion and eases breathing. 3. Administer prescribed morphine: Addresses pain, reduces anxiety, and decreases myocardial oxygen demand. 4. Prepare for possible intubation: The patient's RR is high, and SpO2 is low, indicating potential respiratory failure. 5. Anticipate vasopressor administration: Given the low BP (88/52 mmHg) despite fluid challenge (assuming this was initiated), vasopressors may be needed to maintain adequate perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "1. Administer furosemide: Furosemide is a diuretic and is contraindicated in this scenario due to the patient's already low blood pressure. It will further decrease preload, worsening hypotension and potentially leading to cardiogenic shock. 2. Encourage the patient to cough and deep breathe: While this is generally a good intervention for respiratory issues, the patient's primary problem is not retained secretions but rather pulmonary edema and hypoperfusion. It is not a priority action. 3. Insert a Foley catheter: Insertion of a Foley catheter is important for monitoring urine output, which is essential for assessing renal perfusion. However, it is not the highest priority when the patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability. 4. Obtain a 12-lead ECG: A 12-lead ECG has already been obtained as indicated in the SBAR. Repeating it immediately is not the priority. 5. Initiate a fluid bolus: In the context of cardiogenic shock after an MI, a fluid bolus could worsen pulmonary edema. The SBAR provides no information about any recent fluid challenge. Cautious fluid administration may be considered, but only under strict hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., via a pulmonary artery catheter) and after ruling out fluid overload.",
