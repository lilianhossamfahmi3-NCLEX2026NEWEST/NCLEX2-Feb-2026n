She has a history of chronic hypertension and was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia during this pregnancy. Background: She received magnesium sulfate during labor and delivery. Assessment: At 18:00, her BP is 168/102 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, O2 sat 98% on room air. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with 2 beats of clonus. Urine output was 30 mL/hr over the last 2 hours. She reports a headache and blurred vision. Fundus is firm and at the umbilicus. Lochia rubra is moderate. Recommendation: I'm concerned about worsening preeclampsia and potential postpartum hemorrhage. I recommend continuing close monitoring of vital signs, magnesium sulfate infusion, and assessing for signs of HELLP syndrome.",

        "correct": "The patient's elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred vision, hyperreflexia with clonus, decreased platelets, and elevated liver enzymes indicate worsening preeclampsia and possible HELLP syndrome, placing her at high risk for seizures, stroke, and postpartum hemorrhage. Administering labetalol is crucial to rapidly lower the blood pressure to prevent these complications. Notifying the physician promptly facilitates further orders and potential interventions. Preparing for the administration of magnesium sulfate bolus, if ordered, is important in seizure prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of postpartum hemorrhage is important given the history of preeclampsia. Assessing the fundus and lochia is essential, but less immediate than controlling the blood pressure and notifying the provider.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying the administration of antihypertensive medication and failing to notify the physician first could lead to serious complications such as stroke or seizure. While monitoring for postpartum hemorrhage is important, it is secondary to addressing the immediate threat of uncontrolled hypertension and HELLP syndrome. Assessing fundus and lochia are routine postpartum assessments, but are not the priority given the constellation of patient's symptoms and lab values.",
