At 1430, Morphine 4mg IV was administered, but pain remains 7/10. Current vital signs: BP 90/50, HR 120, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. His abdomen is rigid and tender to palpation. Amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated. The patient is NPO and receiving IV fluids (Lactated Ringers) at 125 mL/hr. Urinary output has decreased since admission. Key concerns are the potential for hypovolemic shock and possible respiratory compromise. I am requesting orders for increased fluid resuscitation and further pain management. Please monitor vital signs closely and assess for signs of worsening condition. Pending labs include CBC, CMP, and coagulation studies.",

Notify the physician of the patient's condition. Increasing fluid resuscitation is paramount due to the patient's hypotension and signs of hypovolemia, which are critical in preventing hypovolemic shock. Addressing pain is important, but after ensuring adequate circulation. Monitoring urine output is vital for assessing renal perfusion and fluid balance. Assessing respiratory status is important due to potential for ARDS or pleural effusions secondary to pancreatitis. Notifying the physician is crucial but follows immediate interventions to stabilize the patient.",

Prioritizing pain management before addressing circulatory issues can mask worsening symptoms and delay critical interventions.
