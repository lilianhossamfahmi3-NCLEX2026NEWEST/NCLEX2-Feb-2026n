        "correct": "Administering oxygen to increase SpO2 is crucial. The patient's SpO2 is significantly low (88%), indicating hypoxemia and the need for immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. Elevating the head of the bed helps reduce preload by promoting venous pooling in the lower extremities, decreasing the workload on the heart, and improving breathing. Administering Furosemide helps reduce fluid overload and pulmonary congestion, improving breathing and reducing the strain on the heart. Notifying the physician is essential to report the patient's deteriorating condition and obtain further orders for management of acute decompensated heart failure. Monitoring vital signs frequently (every 5-15 minutes) is necessary to assess the patient's response to interventions and detect any further deterioration, allowing for timely adjustments to the treatment plan. These actions directly address the patient's compromised respiratory and cardiovascular status, aligning with the immediate priorities in acute decompensated heart failure. The elevated BNP and Troponin levels, along with the S3 heart sound, support the diagnosis and the need for rapid intervention. ClinicalPearl: Rapid interventions in ADHF are critical to prevent further decompensation and potential cardiogenic shock.",
        "incorrect": "Administering morphine may mask the symptoms of worsening heart failure, such as shortness of breath, and can cause respiratory depression, which would be detrimental in this patient. While pain management is important, addressing the respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability is the priority. Encouraging ambulation is contraindicated in a patient experiencing acute decompensated heart failure and respiratory distress. Ambulation increases cardiac workload and oxygen demand, potentially worsening the patient's condition. Decreasing the oxygen flow rate would worsen the patient's hypoxemia and further compromise oxygen delivery to vital organs. Documenting the findings is important but is not an immediate action compared to interventions that directly improve the patient's condition. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important to assess for changes related to the MI, but optimizing oxygenation and reducing fluid overload are higher priorities in this immediate situation. QuestionTrap: Students may be tempted to select interventions that are part of routine MI care, but the focus should be on addressing the acute decompensation. ClinicalPearl: Prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) in acute situations.",
