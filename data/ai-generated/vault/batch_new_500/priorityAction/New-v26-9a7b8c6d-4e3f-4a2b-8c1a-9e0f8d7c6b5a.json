Ensure IV access is patent and secure: Crucial for medication administration and fluid resuscitation during and after surgery. 3. Monitor oxygen saturation continuously: Early detection of desaturation allows for prompt intervention and prevents complications. 4. Review pre-operative checklist and confirm NPO status: Prevents aspiration during anesthesia and ensures all necessary preparations are complete. 5. Communicate with the surgical team regarding the recent hypercyanotic spell: Ensures the surgical team is aware of the infant's history and potential for complications.",

While documenting parental concerns is important, it is not the most critical action prior to surgery. Educating the parents is important, but pre-op teaching has already been completed per the SBAR. Checking the crash cart is a routine task, but not specific to this patient's immediate needs. Weighing the infant is important for medication dosing, but the weight is already known per the SBAR.",
