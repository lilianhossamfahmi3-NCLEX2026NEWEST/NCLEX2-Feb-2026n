        "correct": "1. Administer prescribed pre-operative sedation: Reduces anxiety and oxygen consumption, preventing hypercyanotic spells. Anxious infants are more prone to these episodes, which can be life-threatening. 2. Ensure IV access is patent and secure: Crucial for rapid medication administration (e.g., vasopressors, fluids) during and after surgery, especially given the risk of hemodynamic instability. 3. Monitor oxygen saturation continuously: Early detection of desaturation allows for prompt intervention (e.g., oxygen administration, knee-chest positioning) and prevents severe hypoxemia. 4. Communicate with the surgical team regarding the recent hypercyanotic spell: Informs the team about the infant's instability and the need for potential intraoperative interventions. 5. Review pre-operative checklist and confirm NPO status: Prevents aspiration during anesthesia. The NPO status is especially important due to the increased risk of vomiting and aspiration in infants with cardiac conditions.",
        "incorrect": "Withholding fluids based on NPO status is important, but confirming NPO status and ensuring the pre-operative checklist is complete is a higher priority because it directly impacts patient safety during anesthesia. While documenting parental concerns is important for holistic care, it is not the most critical action prior to surgery in this unstable patient. Educating the parents is important, but pre-op teaching has already been completed per the SBAR, making it a lower priority than immediate physiological needs. Checking the crash cart is a routine task, but not specific to this patient's immediate needs related to Tetralogy of Fallot and the recent tet spell. Weighing the infant is important for medication dosing, but the weight is already known per the SBAR, making it less critical than actions addressing immediate instability.",
