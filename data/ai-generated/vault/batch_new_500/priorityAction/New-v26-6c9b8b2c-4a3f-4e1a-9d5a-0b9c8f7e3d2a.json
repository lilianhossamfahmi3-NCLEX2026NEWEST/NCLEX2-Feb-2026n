B: He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He was found at home by his daughter, disoriented. A: At 07:00, his vital signs are: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min and labored, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.9°C. Labs show elevated ammonia (200 mcg/dL), bilirubin (15 mg/dL), and prolonged PT/INR (2.5). He has asterixis and ascites. He is drowsy but arousable to voice. R: I am concerned about worsening hepatic encephalopathy and potential airway compromise. I recommend STAT lactulose administration, frequent assessment of his mental status, and potential intubation if his respiratory status declines. Please review the labs and MAR.",

        "correct": "1. Assess respiratory status and airway patency: Given the patient's labored breathing, decreased SpO2, and potential for worsening encephalopathy, ensuring a patent airway and adequate ventilation is the immediate priority. This addresses the immediate risk of hypoxemia and respiratory failure, which can quickly become life-threatening. 2. Administer lactulose: Lactulose helps reduce ammonia levels, which contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. The elevated ammonia level (200 mcg/dL) in the lab results supports this intervention. By reducing ammonia, the progression of encephalopathy can be slowed. 3. Monitor neurological status frequently: Frequent neurological assessments are crucial to detect changes in mental status and response to treatment. Worsening encephalopathy may require further intervention, such as increased lactulose dosage or consideration of other therapies. 4. Initiate safety precautions: Due to the patient's confusion and disorientation, implementing safety measures such as bed alarms and side rails is important to prevent falls and injuries. Hepatic encephalopathy can impair judgment and coordination, increasing the risk of accidents. 5. Monitor fluid balance and electrolytes: Patients with liver failure are at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate their condition. The patient's sodium (130 mEq/L) and potassium (3.2 mEq/L) levels are abnormal, requiring close monitoring and potential correction.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying airway assessment in a patient with respiratory distress can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Deferring lactulose administration prolongs the effects of elevated ammonia levels on the brain, worsening encephalopathy. Infrequent neurological assessments can result in delayed detection of worsening encephalopathy, potentially leading to irreversible neurological damage. Neglecting safety precautions puts the patient at risk for falls and injuries, which can further complicate their condition. Ignoring fluid and electrolyte imbalances can worsen liver failure complications, such as ascites and edema.",
