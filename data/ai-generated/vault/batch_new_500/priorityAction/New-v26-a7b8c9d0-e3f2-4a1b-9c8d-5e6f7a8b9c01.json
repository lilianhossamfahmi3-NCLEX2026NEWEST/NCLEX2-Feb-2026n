    "sbar": "S: John Smith, 68-year-old male, admitted at 03:00 with acute chest pain. States pain is 9/10, radiating down left arm. Diagnosed with acute MI. Background: History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Assessment: At 07:00, patient is increasingly dyspneic. O2 saturation 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Respiratory rate 32 and labored. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. BP 82/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, irregular. Urine output 20 mL over the last hour. Patient is anxious and diaphoretic. Currently on continuous cardiac monitoring, IV access established. Medications include aspirin, metoprolol, and morphine IV PRN for pain. Recommendation: Needs immediate intervention for acute decompensated heart failure secondary to MI. Consider rapid sequence intubation and vasopressor support. The patient may have an undiagnosed airborne infection; initiate airborne precautions while awaiting further evaluation.",

    "correct": "The patient is in acute decompensated heart failure evidenced by low blood pressure, tachycardia, dyspnea, low oxygen saturation, and crackles. The elevated troponin confirms acute myocardial infarction. The elevated BNP confirms heart failure. The ABG shows respiratory acidosis. Establishing effective ventilation and oxygenation is paramount. Vasopressors are needed to support blood pressure and maintain perfusion. Furosemide will help reduce fluid overload. Monitoring potassium is crucial due to potential imbalances from furosemide and underlying renal dysfunction. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying any of the high-priority actions listed will negatively impact the patient's outcome. Not addressing the respiratory distress immediately will lead to further hypoxemia and acidosis. Failure to support blood pressure will compromise organ perfusion and worsen the heart failure. Delaying diuresis will exacerbate fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Overlooking electrolyte imbalances can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Discontinuing cardiac monitoring would prevent the nurse from identifying arrythmias secondary to MI.",
