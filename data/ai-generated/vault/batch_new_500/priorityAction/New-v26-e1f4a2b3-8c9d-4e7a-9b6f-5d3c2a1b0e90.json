He has a history of cyanotic episodes. BACKGROUND: Liam's baseline oxygen saturation is 75-80%. At 14:00 today, his mother reported increased fussiness and cyanosis. ASSESSMENT: At 14:15, Liam's vital signs are: HR 180 bpm, RR 60 breaths/min, SpO2 65%, Temp 37.8°C (100°F), BP 90/60 mmHg. He has circumoral cyanosis and increased work of breathing (nasal flaring, retractions). Auscultation reveals a loud systolic murmur. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. IV access is patent, with D5W infusing at 10 mL/hr. Liam weighs 7 kg. Hemoglobin is 18 g/dL. He is drawing his legs up to his chest. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate assessment by the attending physician or cardiologist. Consider morphine sulfate IV to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm him. Initiate knee-chest positioning to improve oxygen saturation. Prepare for potential intubation and respiratory support if his condition worsens.",

        "correct": "Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing right-to-left shunting of blood and improving pulmonary blood flow, thus increasing oxygen saturation. Morphine sulfate decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and calms the infant, reducing oxygen demand. Administering 100% oxygen maximizes available oxygen to tissues, even though the underlying problem is shunting. These actions directly address the physiological crisis of the tet spell by improving oxygenation and reducing blood shunting.\n\nclinicalPearl: Knee-chest position is vital to increase systemic vascular resistance during a Tet spell.",
        "incorrect": "Checking the IV site patency and infusion rate, while important, are not priority actions during a hypercyanotic spell, as the IV is already confirmed patent in the SBAR. Contacting the provider is important, but not the immediate priority. Initiating a fluid bolus may be necessary if the infant is dehydrated, but there is no indication of dehydration, making it a lower priority. Documenting the event is important but follows patient stabilization. Obtaining a blood gas is useful for further assessment but delays immediate interventions. Assessing the infant's pain level is secondary to addressing the life-threatening hypoxemia.\n\nquestionTrap: Selecting actions that are generally good nursing care but not specific to the emergent Tet spell situation. Focus on interventions that directly address the pathophysiology of the hypercyanotic spell, specifically actions that improve oxygenation and reduce right-to-left shunting.",
