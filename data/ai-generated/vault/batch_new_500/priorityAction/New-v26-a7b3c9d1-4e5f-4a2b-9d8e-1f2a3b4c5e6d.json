B: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A CT scan at 08:30 confirmed an acute ischemic stroke with a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. IV alteplase was administered at 09:00. A: Currently, his GCS is 13 (E3, V4, M6). BP is 180/100 mmHg, HR is 92 bpm, RR is 22, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. Pupils are equal and reactive, but there's right-sided facial droop. Weakness is noted in the right arm and leg (2/5 strength). He is alert but intermittently confused. R: I'm concerned about potential increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and further neurological deterioration. I need orders for blood pressure management, frequent neuro checks, and potential interventions for increased ICP.",

        "correct": "1. Administering labetalol IV: Elevated blood pressure post-alteplase increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion and cerebral edema. Strict blood pressure control is crucial to maintain cerebral perfusion and prevent further complications. 2. Performing neurological assessment: Frequent neurological assessments (GCS, pupillary response, motor strength) are essential to monitor for deterioration and signs of increased ICP, which can occur rapidly after a stroke. 3. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees: Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps reduce ICP and improves cerebral perfusion. 4. Initiating aspiration precautions: Stroke patients are at high risk for aspiration due to impaired swallowing and gag reflexes. Aspiration precautions, including positioning and diet modifications, are essential to prevent pneumonia. 5. Administering acetaminophen for temperature >100.4°F: Fever increases metabolic demands and can exacerbate neurological damage. Controlling fever is important, but less urgent than addressing blood pressure, neurological status, and aspiration risk in the acute phase.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen for temperature >100.4°F: While important, addressing fever is a lower priority than managing blood pressure, monitoring neurological status, and preventing aspiration in the acute post-alteplase phase of an ischemic stroke. Initiating aspiration precautions: Although important for preventing pneumonia, it is secondary to controlling BP and neurological assessment immediately after thrombolytic administration. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees: While helpful to decrease ICP and improve cerebral perfusion, it is secondary to BP control and neurological assessment after thrombolytic administration. Performing neurological assessment: While important for detecting changes, it is secondary to BP control immediately following thrombolytic administration to prevent hemorrhagic conversion. Administering labetalol IV: While important, neurological assessment is needed to establish a baseline following thrombolytic administration.",

Remember the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and recognize that uncontrolled hypertension can quickly lead to life-threatening complications like hemorrhagic stroke. Always prioritize interventions that address immediate threats to patient stability before addressing secondary issues. Think critically about the potential complications of thrombolytic therapy."
