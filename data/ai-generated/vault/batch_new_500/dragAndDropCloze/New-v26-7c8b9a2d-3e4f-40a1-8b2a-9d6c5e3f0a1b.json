He lives alone in a rural area and reports difficulty accessing fresh groceries, leading to a diet high in sodium and processed foods. He was alert and oriented upon admission yesterday. \n06:10 A: At 06:00, the client is lethargic and slow to respond to questions. BP 160/90 mmHg (MAP 113), HR 98 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO₂ 92% on 2L NC, Temp 100.0°F (37.8°C). Urine output is only 50 mL over the last 4 hours. Skin turgor is poor, and mucous membranes are dry. \n06:15 R: Provider has been notified of the change in mental status and oliguria. A STAT basic metabolic panel and ABGs were ordered. Recommend continuous cardiac monitoring due to potential electrolyte shifts and preparing for possible acute renal support interventions.",

The most life-threatening consequence is the resulting hyperkalemia (K+ 7.2 mEq/L), which impairs cardiac muscle excitability and can lead to fatal arrhythmias.
