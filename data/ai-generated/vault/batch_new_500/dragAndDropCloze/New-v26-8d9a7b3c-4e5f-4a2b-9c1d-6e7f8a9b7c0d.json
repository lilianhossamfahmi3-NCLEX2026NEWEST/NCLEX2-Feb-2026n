He is now obtunded with severe work of breathing, failing non-invasive oxygen therapy.\n\nBackground: This is a 68-year-old male admitted two days ago for community-acquired pneumonia, now with suspected Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). His medical history is significant for COPD and hypertension. He lives alone and has limited social support, which may complicate discharge planning.\n\nAssessment: At 07:30, the patient is difficult to arouse, responding only to painful stimuli. Respiratory rate is 36/min and shallow, with significant accessory muscle use. SpO₂ remains 88% on a 15L non-rebreather mask, indicating refractory hypoxemia. BP is 95/55 mmHg (MAP 68), HR 118 bpm. Skin is cool and clammy. Bilateral coarse crackles persist on auscultation. The most recent lactate is critically high at 3.5 mmol/L.\n\nRecommendation: I have requested immediate physician presence at the bedside and have the intubation kit ready. We need to proceed with emergent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to prevent imminent respiratory arrest.",
