The key intervention is to administer scheduled diuretics to reduce cardiac workload, while also providing chest physiotherapy to prevent respiratory complications.' This reflects a comprehensive understanding of post-cardiac surgery care in infants. Fluid retention is common due to surgical stress, fluid shifts, and transient myocardial dysfunction. The physical exam finding of crackles, along with the CXR showing vascular congestion and high BNP, confirms this. Diuretics (furosemide) are essential to reduce preload. Chest physiotherapy is crucial to mobilize secretions and prevent atelectasis, especially with existing pleural effusions.",
