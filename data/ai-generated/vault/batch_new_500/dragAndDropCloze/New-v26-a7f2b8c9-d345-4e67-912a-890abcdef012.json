He was extubated at 10:00 this morning and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute.\n\nO: At 14:00, his vital signs are: heart rate 140 bpm, respiratory rate 42 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, BP 90/60 mmHg, and temperature 37.2°C. The surgical site dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Pain level is reported as 3/10; morphine was last administered at 13:00. Labs show BNP at 200 pg/mL.\n\nA: Samuel is stable but requires close monitoring for post-operative complications like pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and respiratory distress.\n\nR: Continue current orders: oxygen supplementation, morphine PRN for pain, and scheduled furosemide. Monitor respiratory status (SpO2, RR, work of breathing). Administer pain medication as needed. Notify the physician for increased respiratory distress or SpO2 below 90%. Consider a STAT BNP if respiratory distress worsens.",
