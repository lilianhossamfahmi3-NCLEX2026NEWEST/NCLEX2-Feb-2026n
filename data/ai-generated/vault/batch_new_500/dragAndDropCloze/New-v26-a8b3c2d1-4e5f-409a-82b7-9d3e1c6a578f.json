A: Over the last hour, his respiratory rate increased to 36/min with significant accessory muscle use. SpO2 has dropped to 88% on a 100% non-rebreather mask. He is tachycardic at 120 bpm and hypotensive at 90/60 mmHg. ABGs from 07:00 show severe hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis (PaO2 55 mmHg, PaCO2 60 mmHg). The client is now agitated and confused.

We will prepare for prone positioning to improve oxygenation."

                "explanation": "Prone positioning is a key intervention that improves ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching. It shifts pressure off the dependent, dorsal lung regions, allowing them to re-expand, and improves drainage of secretions, thereby enhancing oxygenation. 'Supine' positioning can worsen atelectasis."

            "Lung-protective ventilation strategies are crucial to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). This involves using low tidal volumes (e.g., 4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) and maintaining plateau pressures below 30 cm H2O.",
