B: Mr. Jameson has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Initially, he was managed with antibiotics and supplemental oxygen, showing some improvement. A: At 07:00 this morning, Mr. Jameson's respiratory status deteriorated rapidly. His current vital signs are: heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 36 and labored, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, SpO2 88% on 100% FiO2 via non-rebreather. ABG results from 07:00: pH 7.25, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates. He is increasingly agitated and confused. C: I am highly concerned about impending respiratory failure and possible ARDS. I strongly recommend immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. Further investigation into the sepsis cause is crucial. Monitor response to treatment and prepare for potential ARDS and mechanical ventilation complications.",

        "correct": "In ARDS, the alveolar-capillary membrane is damaged, leading to increased permeability and pulmonary edema. This results in impaired gas exchange and decreased lung compliance. The nurse should anticipate the need for positive pressure ventilation and monitor for complications such as pneumothorax. To optimize oxygenation, the nurse should consider placing the patient in the prone position.\n\n**Rationale:** The alveolar-capillary membrane damage is the hallmark of ARDS, causing fluid leakage into the alveoli and impairing gas exchange. Decreased lung compliance results from the edema and inflammation, making it harder for the lungs to expand. Positive pressure ventilation is often required to maintain adequate oxygenation and support breathing. Pneumothorax is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation, particularly when high pressures are used. Prone positioning helps improve oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, allowing for better gas exchange in previously compressed areas of the lungs.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of ARDS and appropriate nursing interventions. Review the underlying causes of ARDS, the effects on gas exchange and lung mechanics, and the rationale for specific interventions such as mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Pay close attention to the potential complications associated with these interventions. For example, consider why other options, such as treatments directly targeting the underlying infection, are not the immediate priority in the face of acute respiratory distress.",
