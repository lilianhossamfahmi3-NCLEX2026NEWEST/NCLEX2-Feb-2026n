He reports good adherence to his bowel program. He lives alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, which he states is a barrier to consistent follow-up care. He is a reliable historian.\nASSESSMENT: On admission, client is alert and oriented x4. Vital signs are stable. Skin is warm, dry, and intact. He denies any current pain, headache, or other symptoms of AD. He is emotionally stable and expresses understanding of the plan of care.\nRECOMMENDATION: Proceed with the planned urological consult. Continue current medication regimen. Reinforce education on signs and symptoms of AD and UTI. Monitor vital signs per protocol."

His last self-catheterization was at 12:00, and he reports feeling a sense of urinary urgency. His last bowel movement was yesterday morning.\nASSESSMENT: Vital signs show acute hypertension at 210/112 mmHg (MAP 145) and bradycardia at 52 bpm. Client is visibly anxious, with marked diaphoresis and flushing on his face, neck, and upper chest. A bladder scan was performed at the bedside and revealed 650 mL of retained urine. Neurological status is otherwise at baseline.\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia is required. The primary goal is to lower blood pressure by identifying and removing the noxious stimulus. Will elevate the head of bed immediately, prepare for straight catheterization, and have PRN hydralazine ready."

First, elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees uses gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension, providing the most rapid, non-invasive method to lower blood pressure. Second, addressing the most common trigger—bladder distension (confirmed by the 650 mL scan)—is critical. Third, if these measures do not resolve the hypertension, administering a rapid-acting antihypertensive like IV hydralazine is necessary to prevent complications like stroke. Finally, once the primary trigger is managed, assessing for other potential causes like fecal impaction is appropriate.",

Administering an opioid for the headache treats a symptom but ignores the life-threatening cause (hypertension) and can mask changes in neurological status. While assessing for fecal impaction is part of the AD protocol, it is a lower priority than addressing the confirmed bladder distension, which is the most frequent cause.",
