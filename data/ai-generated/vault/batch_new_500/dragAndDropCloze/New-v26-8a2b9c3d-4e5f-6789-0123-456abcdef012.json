His current pain level is 7/10. BACKGROUND: Mr. Riley has a history of autonomic dysreflexia. He was admitted for a routine urological workup. He typically self-manages his bowel program at 07:00 daily. ASSESSMENT: At 16:15, his BP is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm. He is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of his injury. He reports feeling anxious and nauseated. A bladder scan reveals 600 mL of urine. Bowel sounds are present. He denies any recent bowel movement. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia, including elevating the head of the bed, catheterization to relieve bladder distension, and further assessment to identify and eliminate any other potential triggers. Consider administering hydralazine if blood pressure remains elevated.",

Elevate the head of the bed to 45 degrees or higher: This promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to reduce blood pressure and decrease the risk of complications from severe hypertension.\n2. Assess for and relieve bladder distension by catheterizing the patient: Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Relieving the pressure can quickly reduce the blood pressure.\n3. Monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes: Close monitoring allows for timely assessment of the patient's response to interventions and guides further treatment decisions.\n4. Administer prescribed antihypertensive medication (Hydralazine) if blood pressure remains elevated: Hydralazine is a vasodilator that can effectively lower blood pressure in cases of autonomic dysreflexia when other measures are insufficient.",
        "incorrect": "Reclining the patient flat can worsen hypertension by increasing venous return and cardiac output. Waiting 30 minutes to catheterize delays the relief of a major trigger. Assessing for fecal impaction is important, but not the priority intervention given the lack of recent bowel movement and presence of bowel sounds. Administering docusate sodium is a preventative measure for constipation but is not indicated for the immediate treatment of autonomic dysreflexia.",
