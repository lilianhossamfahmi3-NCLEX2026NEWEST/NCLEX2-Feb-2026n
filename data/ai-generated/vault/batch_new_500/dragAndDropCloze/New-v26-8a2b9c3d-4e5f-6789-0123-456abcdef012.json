    "sbar": "SITUATION: Jameson Riley, 34-year-old male with a T6 spinal cord injury from a motorcycle accident 5 years ago, is reporting a severe headache and blurred vision. BACKGROUND: The patient has a history of autonomic dysreflexia. He was admitted for routine urological workup. He self-manages his bowel program at 07:00 daily. ASSESSMENT: At 08:30, BP is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm. He is diaphoretic and flushed above the level of his injury. He reports feeling anxious. Bladder scan reveals 600 mL urine. Bowel sounds are present. No fecal impaction is suspected based on last BM. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate intervention for autonomic dysreflexia, including catheterization to relieve bladder distension and further assessment to identify and eliminate any other potential triggers.",

    "correct": "1. Elevate the head of the bed to 45 degrees or higher to promote orthostatic hypotension and reduce blood pressure.\n2. Assess for and relieve bladder distension by catheterizing the patient. Bladder distension is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia.\n3. Monitor blood pressure every 5 minutes. This allows for close observation of the patient's response to interventions and guides further treatment.\n4. Administer prescribed antihypertensive medication (Hydralazine) if blood pressure remains elevated despite initial interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Reclining the patient flat can worsen the hypertension by increasing venous return and cardiac output. Waiting 30 minutes to catheterize delays the relief of a major trigger. Assessing for fecal impaction is important, but not the priority intervention given the recent bowel movement. Administering docusate sodium would be a preventative measure but is not indicated for immediate treatment.",
