T 38.8°C. \nB: History of COPD and hypertension. Admitted for pneumonia and started on IV antibiotics. Worsening respiratory status despite antibiotics.\nA: ABG at 06:00: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. FiO2 0.40. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates. Lung sounds reveal diffuse crackles and diminished breath sounds in the bases. Patient is increasingly anxious and restless.\nR: I am concerned about acute respiratory failure and possible ARDS. Recommend increasing FiO2, considering intubation and mechanical ventilation, and consulting respiratory therapy. Request STAT ABG after any intervention. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is crucial. Notify MD immediately if the patient's condition deteriorates further.",
