    "sbar": "S: Infant Samuel Jones, 6 months old, admitted at 06:00 for evaluation of cyanosis. History of a heart murmur has been present since birth. Mother reports increased cyanosis, especially noticeable during feeding. B: Samuel is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect. He has a history of cyanotic episodes. O: At 07:30, vital signs are as follows: HR 180 bpm, RR 60 breaths/min, SpO2 78% on room air. Physical assessment reveals clubbing of fingers and toes. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. Weight is 7 kg. Auscultation reveals a harsh systolic murmur. Laboratory results are pending. The infant is currently fussy and irritable. A: Samuel is experiencing an exacerbation of Tetralogy of Fallot, likely a hypercyanotic spell (tet spell). This requires immediate close monitoring and potential intervention to improve oxygenation and prevent further complications. Plan to administer supplemental oxygen and continuously monitor vital signs per unit protocol. The cardiologist has been notified of Samuel's current status. At 08:00, the physician ordered morphine sulfate 0.1mg/kg IV PRN for tet spells, and propranolol 0.5mg PO BID.",

    "correct": "In Tetralogy of Fallot, the right-to-left shunt caused by the ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis leads to decreased pulmonary blood flow and desaturated blood entering the systemic circulation, resulting in low oxygen saturation. Morphine is administered to calm the infant and reduce the respiratory rate, which decreases the demand for oxygen and helps break the hypercyanotic spell. Activities that increase oxygen demand or cause agitation, like crying or straining during bowel movements, should be avoided. Parents need to be vigilant for signs of stroke, such as weakness or paralysis, which can occur due to polycythemia and increased blood viscosity.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options reflect a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot, the management of hypercyanotic spells, or the potential complications associated with the condition. Choosing an incorrect saturation level, medication, activity, or sign of complication demonstrates a gap in knowledge regarding the critical care of infants with Tetralogy of Fallot.",
