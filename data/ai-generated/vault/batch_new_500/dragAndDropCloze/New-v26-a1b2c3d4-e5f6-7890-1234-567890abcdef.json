He has a history of PTSD and depression. B: He served two tours in Afghanistan. He was prescribed oxycodone for chronic back pain sustained during his service. He reported increased feelings of hopelessness and isolation to his primary care physician last week.

    "correct": "1. Ensure continuous observation and monitoring: The patient's safety is the top priority given the recent suicide attempt. Continuous monitoring will allow for immediate intervention if the patient's condition deteriorates or if they express further suicidal ideation.\n2. Establish a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship: Building trust and rapport can help the patient feel more comfortable sharing their feelings and concerns. A strong therapeutic relationship can facilitate open communication and encourage the patient to engage in treatment.\n3. Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment: A comprehensive assessment is crucial to understand the patient's current state of mind, identify triggers, and determine the level of risk. This assessment should include exploring the patient's thoughts, plans, and access to means.\n4. Collaborate with the treatment team: Involving the treatment team, including the psychiatrist, therapist, and social worker, ensures a coordinated approach to the patient's care. This collaboration allows for a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific needs.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to a delay in providing the most critical interventions, potentially endangering the patient. For example, conducting a suicide risk assessment before ensuring continuous observation could leave the patient at risk if they attempt suicide again. Prioritizing collaboration before establishing a therapeutic relationship may be ineffective as the patient may be less receptive to sharing information if they do not trust the nurse. Focusing solely on the therapeutic relationship without continuous monitoring may lead to a missed opportunity to prevent harm.",
