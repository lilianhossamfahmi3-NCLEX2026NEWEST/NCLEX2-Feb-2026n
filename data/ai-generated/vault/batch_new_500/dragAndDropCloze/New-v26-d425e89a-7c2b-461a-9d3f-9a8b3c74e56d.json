Background: Patient has a history of gestational hypertension, which resolved postpartum. Assessment: At 08:00, the patient reports increased vaginal bleeding and a severe headache. Her fundus is boggy and displaced, with heavy lochia rubra and clots. Blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 22, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Lab results show a Hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, Platelets of 120,000/mcL, elevated liver enzymes, and 3+ protein in urine. The patient is alert but visibly anxious. Recommendation: I request immediate orders for postpartum hemorrhage and possible preeclampsia management, including continuous monitoring, fluid resuscitation, and potential medication administration to stabilize her condition.",

        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is:\n1. Establish two large-bore IV lines: Rapid fluid resuscitation and medication administration are critical in managing postpartum hemorrhage and potential complications of preeclampsia. Establishing IV access ensures immediate availability for fluids and medications.\n2. Assess fundal tone and perform fundal massage: Addressing uterine atony, a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, is paramount. Fundal massage helps stimulate uterine contraction and reduce bleeding.\n3. Initiate Magnesium Sulfate IV: Given the elevated BP and other signs of preeclampsia (headache, proteinuria), seizure prophylaxis is essential. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent seizures in preeclamptic patients.\n4. Administer Methylergonovine 0.2mg IM: This uterotonic medication helps contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. However, it is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure; benefits outweigh the risks at this point. Monitor BP closely. Methylergonovine promotes uterine contraction but can elevate blood pressure, requiring careful monitoring.\n5. Prepare for possible blood transfusion: The low hemoglobin level indicates significant blood loss, necessitating preparation for possible transfusion. Blood transfusion may be necessary to restore adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences demonstrate a lack of understanding of the urgency and prioritization of interventions in managing postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia. For instance, administering methylergonovine before addressing the fundal tone or establishing IV access delays crucial interventions. Delaying magnesium sulfate administration in the presence of elevated BP increases the risk of seizures.",
