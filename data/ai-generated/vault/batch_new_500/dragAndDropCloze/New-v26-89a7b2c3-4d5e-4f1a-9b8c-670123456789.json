        "sbar": "S: Jameson Walker is a 62-year-old male admitted two days ago with a diagnosis of pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and is exhibiting signs of worsening respiratory distress. At 06:00, his SpO2 was 88% on 4L via nasal cannula. By 06:15, he demonstrated increased work of breathing, including the use of accessory muscles.\nB: Mr. Walker has a medical history significant for hypertension and COPD. He has been treated for pneumonia with intravenous ceftriaxone. He has no known drug allergies other than penicillin.\nA: At 06:30, arterial blood gas (ABG) results revealed a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, PaO2 of 58 mmHg, and HCO3 of 24 mEq/L. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). His blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, and his heart rate is 120 bpm. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse crackles. The patient is increasingly agitated and confused, indicating declining mental status.\nR: I am highly concerned about impending respiratory failure and the development of ARDS. I am requesting orders for immediate mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategies and further management of ARDS. The patient requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic stability. We need to act quickly to prevent further deterioration.",

        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is:\n1. Administer a bolus of normal saline: The patient's blood pressure is low (100/60 mmHg) and needs to be addressed before escalating oxygen delivery. Hypotension can worsen oxygen delivery to tissues. Addressing hypotension is paramount to ensure adequate tissue perfusion before escalating oxygen delivery.\n2. Increase FiO2 to 60%: The patient's SpO2 is low (88%) despite 4L of oxygen. Increasing the FiO2 is the next logical step to attempt to improve oxygenation non-invasively. This aims to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, facilitating better oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream.\n3. Initiate mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes: Given the ABG results (pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg) and signs of respiratory distress, the patient requires mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Low tidal volumes are crucial in ARDS to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). ARDS impairs lung compliance, making it susceptible to damage from high tidal volumes.\n4. Position the patient prone: Prone positioning can improve oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, reducing shunting. This position helps to equalize the ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lungs, improving gas exchange.\n5. Administer furosemide: This would be appropriate for fluid overload, but the patient's low blood pressure suggests hypovolemia. Furosemide would likely worsen the hypotension. Administering a diuretic in the presence of hypovolemia can further compromise blood pressure and tissue perfusion.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect orders of interventions will not address the patient's immediate needs and could potentially worsen their condition. For example, initiating mechanical ventilation without addressing the hypotension could lead to further hemodynamic instability. Administering furosemide without assessing fluid status could worsen hypovolemia.",
