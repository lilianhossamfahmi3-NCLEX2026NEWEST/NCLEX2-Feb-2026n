Plan is to admit for IV antibiotics and respiratory support.\n\nProgress Note (Today, 06:30):\nS: Client's respiratory status has acutely declined. At 06:30, he is agitated with severe dyspnea and use of accessory muscles. His SpO2 is 88% despite being on a 15L/min non-rebreather mask, indicating refractory hypoxemia.\nB: He is a 62-year-old male admitted two days ago for pneumonia, with a history of COPD and hypertension. He is allergic to Penicillin. The client lives alone in a rural area, which may pose challenges for post-discharge follow-up.\nA: Current vitals are BP 100/60 mmHg (MAP 73), HR 120 bpm, RR 32/min. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse bilateral crackles. A stat ABG shows severe hypoxemic respiratory failure with respiratory acidosis: pH 7.30, PaO2 58, PaCO2 55. He is becoming increasingly confused.\nR: I am concerned for impending respiratory failure from ARDS. I recommend immediate fluid resuscitation for his hypotension, followed by emergent endotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategies."
