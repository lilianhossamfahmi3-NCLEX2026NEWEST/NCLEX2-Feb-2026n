The second priority is administering mannitol, a potent osmotic diuretic that rapidly reduces cerebral edema by pulling fluid from brain tissue into the vasculature. Third, controlling hyperthermia with acetaminophen is critical because fever increases cerebral metabolic rate and blood flow, exacerbating ICP. Fourth, once immediate interventions are initiated, a focused neurological assessment is performed to establish a new baseline and evaluate the response to treatment. Finally, administering a stool softener to prevent the Valsalva maneuver is a preventative measure, making it the lowest priority in this acute phase.",

For instance, performing an assessment before elevating the head of the bed wastes critical time when a simple positioning change could be life-saving.

Failing to address hyperthermia negates the effects of other ICP-lowering interventions by keeping metabolic demand high.

        "questionTrap": "A common trap is to prioritize assessment over immediate action. In a crisis like rapidly increasing ICP, the nurse must initiate simple, life-saving interventions like positioning simultaneously with or even before a detailed reassessment.",
        "mnemonic": "For ICP intervention priorities, remember 'BRAIN':\nB - Bed head up (30 degrees)\nR - Reduce stimulation & fever\nA - Administer osmotic diuretics (Mannitol)\nI - Intubation & ventilation (if GCS < 8)\nN - Neuro checks (after interventions start)",
