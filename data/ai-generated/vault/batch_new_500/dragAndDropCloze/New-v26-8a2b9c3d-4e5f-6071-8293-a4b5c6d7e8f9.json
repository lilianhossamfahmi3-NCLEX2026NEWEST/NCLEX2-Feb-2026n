Current BP 190/110 mmHg, HR 92 bpm (regular), RR 22 (labored), SpO2 94% on 2L nasal cannula, Temp 38.5°C. Oxygen therapy and continuous cardiac monitoring initiated per stroke protocol. Labs pending. R: Concerned about increased ICP given stroke location, GCS, and vital signs. Requesting orders for mannitol to address potential cerebral edema and frequent neurological monitoring. Need assistance with BP management, given elevated readings despite PRN hydralazine. Recommend interventions to manage elevated temperature.",

        "correct": "The interventions are prioritized based on the immediate need to reduce ICP and prevent further neurological damage following a hemorrhagic stroke. Administering mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, rapidly reduces cerebral edema by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the intravascular space, decreasing ICP. Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, further reducing ICP. Frequent neurological assessments, including level of consciousness (LOC), pupillary response, and motor function, are crucial for monitoring the patient's response to interventions and detecting any deterioration. Preventing the Valsalva maneuver, such as by administering stool softeners, avoids increases in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can impede venous return from the brain and increase ICP. Maintaining normothermia (36-37°C) reduces cerebral metabolic demand and cerebral blood flow, which helps to lower ICP and prevent further brain injury. Hyperthermia significantly increases metabolic demands, exacerbating the risk of neurological damage.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor serum osmolality when administering mannitol to avoid dehydration or hyperosmolar states. QuestionTrap: Students may focus solely on lowering blood pressure without addressing the underlying issue of increased ICP. While blood pressure control is important, reducing ICP is the immediate priority. Mnemonic: ICP Management: Elevate Head, Control Temperature, Prevent Valsalva, Osmotic Diuretics, Monitor Neuro Status.",
        "incorrect": "Reversing the order or prioritizing less critical interventions can lead to increased ICP and further neurological damage. Delaying mannitol administration or failing to elevate the head of the bed will prolong cerebral edema and increase the risk of herniation. Infrequent neurological assessments may delay the detection of worsening conditions. Ignoring measures to prevent the Valsalva maneuver can exacerbate ICP. Neglecting temperature control will increase metabolic demand and cerebral blood flow, worsening ICP.",
