        "correct": "The correct order reflects the immediate need to address uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Fundal massage is the first-line intervention to stimulate uterine contraction by physically compressing the uterus and encouraging it to regain its tone. Oxytocin, a uterotonic medication, is administered to further contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. Oxygen is indicated if saturation drops below 95% to ensure adequate oxygenation of vital organs. Frequent monitoring of vital signs helps to detect changes in the patient's condition, such as hypotension or tachycardia, which may indicate hypovolemic shock. Finally, fluid resuscitation with normal saline is crucial to address hypovolemia caused by blood loss and maintain adequate circulating volume. Rapid intervention is essential to prevent further complications.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect prioritization may delay effective management of postpartum hemorrhage, potentially leading to severe complications such as hypovolemic shock and the need for blood transfusions or surgical intervention. Failing to address the uterine atony promptly can result in continued blood loss, exacerbating the patient's condition. Delaying fluid resuscitation can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ damage. Administering oxygen before addressing the bleeding will not resolve the underlying cause of hypovolemia.",

Address the bleeding first by stimulating uterine contraction through fundal massage and uterotonic medications. Then, provide supplemental oxygen if needed and initiate fluid resuscitation to restore circulating volume. Prioritize interventions based on their direct impact on stopping the hemorrhage and preventing further complications."
