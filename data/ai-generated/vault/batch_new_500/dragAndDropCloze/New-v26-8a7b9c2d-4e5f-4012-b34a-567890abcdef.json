B: Mr. Smith has a history of MRSA pneumonia one year ago, successfully treated with Vancomycin. He is currently receiving Ceftriaxone for his present pneumonia. A: At 07:00, his temperature was 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate 110, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr over the last 2 hours. Pending lab results include blood cultures, but yesterday's WBC count was 15,000/mm3. His lactate is now resulted at 3.5 mmol/L and Creatinine at 2.1 mg/dL. A: I am highly concerned about the possibility of developing septic shock given the vital sign changes, decreased urine output, elevated lactate, and increased WBC. R: I strongly recommend stat blood cultures, a repeat lactate level, and a 500 mL fluid bolus to start. Consider changing antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin based on his history and pending culture results. Continuously monitor his MAP to assess response to interventions.",

        "correct": "Septic shock: The patient's elevated temperature, decreased blood pressure, increased WBC count, and elevated lactate indicate possible septic shock, a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. Fluid resuscitation: Hypotension in sepsis requires prompt fluid resuscitation to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Vancomycin: Given the patient's history of MRSA, empiric antibiotic coverage should include Vancomycin while awaiting culture results. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP is a crucial indicator of tissue perfusion. Monitoring MAP helps determine the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.",
