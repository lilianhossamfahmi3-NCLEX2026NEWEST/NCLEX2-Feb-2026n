B: Mr. Smith has a history of MRSA pneumonia one year ago, successfully treated with Vancomycin. He is currently receiving Ceftriaxone for his present pneumonia. A: At 07:00, his temperature was 39.2°C (102.5°F), heart rate 110, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr over the last 2 hours. Pending lab results include blood cultures, but yesterday's WBC count was 15,000/mm3. Lactate is 3.5 mmol/L and Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL. A: I'm concerned about septic shock given vital sign changes, decreased urine output, elevated lactate, and increased WBC. R: I recommend stat blood cultures, repeat lactate, and a 500 mL fluid bolus. Consider changing antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin based on history and pending cultures. Continuously monitor MAP to assess response.",

Fluid resuscitation: Hypotension in sepsis requires prompt fluid resuscitation to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion. clinicalPearl: Crystalloids are typically the first-line choice. Vancomycin: Given the patient's history of MRSA, empiric antibiotic coverage should include Vancomycin while awaiting culture results. clinicalPearl: Always consider patient history when selecting antibiotics. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP is a crucial indicator of tissue perfusion. Monitoring MAP helps determine the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. clinicalPearl: A MAP of 65 mmHg or greater is generally desired in sepsis.",
