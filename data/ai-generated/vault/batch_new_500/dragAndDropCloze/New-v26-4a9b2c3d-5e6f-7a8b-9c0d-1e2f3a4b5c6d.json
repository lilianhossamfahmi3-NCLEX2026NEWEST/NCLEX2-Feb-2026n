Initial NIHSS score was 18. IV tPA was administered at 03:45, within the thrombolytic window. B: History includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with oral meds. No known drug allergies. A: At 07:00, GCS is 12 (E3, V4, M5), indicating neurological decline. Left pupil is 3mm and reactive; right pupil is 5mm and sluggish. BP is 180/100 mmHg, HR is 60 bpm, RR is 12, SpO2 is 95% on 2L NC. Emesis occurred at 06:45. Labs and MAR available. Vitals worsening. R: Concern for increasing ICP given GCS change, asymmetrical pupils, and elevated BP. Requires neurocritical care assessment and ICP monitoring if indicated. Strict BP management is crucial for CPP. Consider further imaging to rule out hemorrhagic conversion. Please evaluate and advise on management.",

        "correct": "1. Mannitol: Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce cerebral edema by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the bloodstream, thereby decreasing ICP. It is a first-line treatment for elevated ICP. ClinicalPearl: Monitor serum osmolality during mannitol administration to avoid renal complications. 2. 30-45: Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, which helps to reduce ICP. This is a fundamental nursing intervention. ClinicalPearl: Ensure the patient's neck is in a neutral position to avoid jugular vein compression. 3. Stool Softeners: Preventing straining during bowel movements is crucial because the Valsalva maneuver increases ICP. Stool softeners, such as docusate, ease bowel movements and prevent straining. ClinicalPearl: Encourage adequate hydration and fiber intake in addition to stool softeners. 4. Blood Pressure: Maintaining adequate blood pressure is vital to ensure cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is sufficient to perfuse the brain. CPP is calculated as MAP - ICP. Both hypertension and hypotension can worsen outcomes; therefore, close monitoring and management are essential. ClinicalPearl: Consult physician orders for target BP range. 5. Loud Noises: A calm environment minimizes external stimuli that can exacerbate ICP. Reducing stimulation helps to prevent increases in ICP. ClinicalPearl: Cluster nursing care to allow for periods of rest and reduced stimulation.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of ICP management or prioritization. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and less effective than Mannitol for immediate ICP reduction in this context. Elevating the head of the bed to an incorrect angle (e.g., 60-90 degrees) will not optimize venous drainage and may compromise cerebral perfusion. Addressing seizures is important in neurological patients but is secondary to reducing cerebral edema and preventing straining in the immediate management of increased ICP. Neglecting blood pressure management and environmental stimuli can potentially worsen the patient's condition.",

Prioritize interventions that directly address increased ICP, followed by measures to prevent secondary complications. Remember that mannitol is the preferred diuretic in this setting, and head elevation to 30-45 degrees is the standard recommendation."
