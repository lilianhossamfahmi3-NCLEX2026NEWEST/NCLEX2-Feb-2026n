He is increasingly confused and disoriented, suggestive of worsening hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nBackground: Admitted at 06:00, he was initially alert and oriented to person and place. His history is significant for chronic liver disease and he lives alone with limited social support. Standing orders include lactulose and neomycin to manage hyperammonemia. He has a known allergy to Penicillin.\n\nAssessment: As of 14:00, the client is disoriented to time and place, with pronounced asterixis (liver flap). His latest serum ammonia level is critically high at 210 mcg/dL. Vital signs are trending towards instability with increasing heart and respiratory rates. He is becoming more lethargic and difficult to arouse.\n\nRecommendation: Immediate neurological assessment using the GCS is required to quantify the level of consciousness. The ordered medications to reduce ammonia should be administered promptly. We need to continue close monitoring of his neurological status and vital signs.",
