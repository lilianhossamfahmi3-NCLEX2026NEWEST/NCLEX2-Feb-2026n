His surgical recovery has been uncomplicated, with pain managed effectively. He is transitioning from subcutaneous to IV heparin for more consistent anticoagulation. The client lives alone in a rural area, which may present challenges for post-discharge follow-up and monitoring. His weight is documented as 220 lbs.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nCurrent vital signs at 08:00 are stable. The client's most recent laboratory results from 06:00 show a platelet count of 140,000/μL, which is below the normal reference range, and a PTT of 46 seconds, which is elevated. These findings suggest an increased risk for bleeding.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe nurse has calculated the prescribed dose but is concerned about the client's coagulation status. The recommendation is to withhold the heparin administration and contact the provider immediately to report the laboratory findings and seek clarification before proceeding.",
