    "sbar": "Dr. Jones, this is Nurse Lee on Med-Surg Unit. I'm calling about John Smith, a 68-year-old male (DOB 03/15/1956, MRN 1234567). He was admitted yesterday at 1800 for DVT prophylaxis following a hip replacement. He reports 3/10 pain at the surgical site, managed with PRN oxycodone. Current vitals (0530): BP 130/80, HR 78, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F, SpO2 97% on room air. He has a peripheral IV in his left forearm, patent and without signs of infection. The physician has ordered a transition from subcutaneous heparin (5000 units q12h) to IV heparin for better anticoagulation control. New orders include a heparin bolus of 80 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 18 units/kg/hour. His weight is 220 lbs. Recent lab results show a platelet count of 140,000/μL and a PTT of 46 seconds. I'm seeking clarification on the calculated bolus and infusion rates, and guidance on whether to proceed with the heparin infusion given the lab values. Thank you.",

    "correct": "The correct bolus dose is 8000 units. 220 lbs is approximately 100 kg. 80 units/kg * 100 kg = 8000 units. The correct infusion rate is 14.9 mL/hr. The order is 18 units/kg/hour. 18 units/kg/hour * 100 kg = 1800 units/hour. If the concentration is 120 units/mL, then 1800 units/hour / 120 units/mL = 15 mL/hour. Rounding to the nearest tenth gives 14.9 mL/hr. The patient's platelet count is slightly low at 140,000/μL (normal range 150,000 - 400,000/μL) and PTT is elevated at 46 seconds (normal 25-35 seconds). Heparin can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and bleeding. The nurse should hold the heparin infusion and notify the physician because the patient's platelet count is slightly low and the PTT is elevated, increasing the risk of bleeding.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect calculations will lead to incorrect bolus and infusion dosages, potentially harming the patient. Continuing the infusion with an already slightly low platelet count and elevated PTT could lead to further complications such as bleeding. Decreasing the infusion rate without notifying the physician is inappropriate as the patient's coagulation status needs to be assessed first.",

      "Always double-check medication calculations, especially for high-alert medications like heparin.",
