        "correct": "Hypovolemic shock requires rapid intervention to restore circulating volume and oxygen delivery. Applying direct pressure is the immediate priority to control the source of bleeding. Inserting a second large-bore IV ensures adequate access for fluid and blood administration. Administering PRBCs addresses the hemoglobin deficit and improves oxygen-carrying capacity. Elevating the legs promotes venous return and increases preload. Vasopressors are generally used after fluid resuscitation to address persistent hypotension.\n\nclinicalPearl: Remember the order of interventions: stop the bleed, ensure IV access, replace volume, and then consider vasopressors if needed.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of interventions can delay stabilization and worsen the patient's condition. Delaying direct pressure prolongs bleeding. Administering fluids or blood without adequate IV access slows resuscitation. Using vasopressors before addressing volume depletion can exacerbate tissue hypoperfusion. Leg elevation alone is insufficient to address significant volume loss.\n\nclinicalPearl: Prioritizing interventions based on the immediate threat to the patient's life is crucial.
