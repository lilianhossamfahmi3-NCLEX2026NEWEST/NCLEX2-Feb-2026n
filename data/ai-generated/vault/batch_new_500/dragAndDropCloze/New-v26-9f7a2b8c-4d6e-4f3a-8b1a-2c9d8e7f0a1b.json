He has a known history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The client lives alone in a rural area with limited access to consistent follow-up care, which has complicated management of his chronic conditions.\n\nAssessment: Glasgow Coma Scale has decreased from 15 on admission to 12. Vital signs are unstable: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen, 3+ pitting edema in lower extremities, and newly noted asterixis. Critical labs from 13:30 show an ammonia level of 210 mcg/dL.\n\nRecommendation: The primary concern is severe hepatic encephalopathy. I will administer the scheduled 18:00 dose of lactulose now per protocol for acute mental status change. I will hold all PRN sedating medications, including morphine, and implement seizure precautions. I have requested the provider to come to the bedside for immediate evaluation.",
