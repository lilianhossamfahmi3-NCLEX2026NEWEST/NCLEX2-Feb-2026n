Liam was admitted at 0600 with increased cyanosis and respiratory distress. His current O2 saturation is 78% on room air; he is irritable and crying. Morphine 0.5mg IV was administered at 0630 for pain and anxiety. His heart rate is 160 bpm, respiratory rate is 50, and temperature is 37.8°C. The cardiologist is aware and has scheduled him for surgical repair tomorrow morning. He has a peripheral IV in his left hand and is NPO except for clear liquids. I am concerned about his increasing cyanosis and the risk of a hypercyanotic spell. I request orders for PRN oxygen and a repeat morphine dose if needed. Do you have any other recommendations?",

        "correct": "Preventing agitation and crying is crucial to avoid triggering hypercyanotic spells (Tet spells) in infants with Tetralogy of Fallot, as these increase oxygen demand. Minimizing stimulation through spaced out care activities will help to prevent overstimulation. Placing the infant in a knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, reducing the right-to-left shunt. Morphine is often administered to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and calm the infant. Maintaining adequate hydration helps to prevent increased blood viscosity, which can exacerbate cyanosis.\n\nclinicalPearl: Remember that Tet spells are most common in the morning or after stressful procedures.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the risk factors for Tet spells and appropriate interventions can lead to increased cyanosis, respiratory distress, and potential complications. While providing constant stimulation may seem like a way to monitor the infant, it can actually increase their agitation and oxygen demand. Supine position increases venous return and can worsen the right-to-left shunt. Diuretics are contraindicated as they can lead to dehydration and increased blood viscosity, exacerbating the cyanosis. Normal saline bolus is not typically the first-line treatment for a Tet spell and may overload the infant's system.\n\nclinicalPearl: Rapid assessment and intervention are key to managing Tet spells effectively.",
