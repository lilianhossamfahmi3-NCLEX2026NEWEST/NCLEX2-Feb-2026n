Mother reports he has been increasingly fussy over the past 12 hours with poor feeding. The family lives in a rural area, a 2-hour drive from the hospital, which has been a barrier to accessing specialty follow-up care.\n\nA: Tachycardic (160/min), tachypneic (50/min). Audible loud, harsh systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Perioral and nail bed cyanosis noted. Infant is irritable and difficult to soothe. Compensatory polycythemia noted on admission labs (Hct 55%). IV morphine administered at 06:30 provided temporary relief.\n\nR: Continue close cardiorespiratory monitoring. Implement measures to minimize stress and prevent hypercyanotic spells. Maintain strict hydration. Prepare for emergency management of a 'Tet spell' with PRN oxygen and morphine."

Preventing agitation and crying is paramount as these activities increase oxygen demand and can trigger a hypercyanotic 'Tet spell' by worsening the right-to-left shunt. Spacing out care activities minimizes stimulation and conserves the infant's limited energy reserves. During a Tet spell, the knee-chest position is the immediate priority; it increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which reduces the amount of deoxygenated blood shunting into the systemic circulation and promotes pulmonary blood flow. Morphine is administered to reduce infundibular spasm and for its sedative effects, which decrease agitation and oxygen consumption. Maintaining adequate hydration is crucial to prevent hemoconcentration from compensatory polycythemia, reducing the risk of a thromboembolic event like a stroke.",
