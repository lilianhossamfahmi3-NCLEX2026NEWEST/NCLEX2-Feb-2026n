A: At 14:00, he is on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His SpO2 is 90% (was 92%), heart rate is 120 beats per minute (was 110), and blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg (was 140/80). The high-pressure alarm on the ventilator is sounding intermittently. Increased agitation and diminished breath sounds on the right side are present. His central venous pressure (CVP) is trending upward to 14 mmHg. ABG at 13:30: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 80 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. C: I am concerned about a possible pneumothorax or airway obstruction. I request a STAT chest x-ray and assessment for suctioning.

        "correct": "The high pressure alarm indicates increased resistance to airflow. The nurse should first assess the patient and the ventilator circuit for obstruction or other correctable causes. Common causes include mucus plugging, biting the endotracheal tube, or kinks in the ventilator tubing. A tension pneumothorax requires immediate intervention, such as a needle thoracostomy, to relieve pressure on the lung and mediastinum. Prevention of VAP is crucial and includes elevating the head of the bed and providing meticulous oral care. Elevating the head of the bed reduces the risk of aspiration, and meticulous oral care reduces the bacterial load in the oral cavity, decreasing the risk of bacteria entering the lungs.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to address the high pressure alarm promptly can lead to barotrauma or hypoventilation. Overlooking a pneumothorax can result in cardiovascular collapse. Inadequate VAP prevention increases the risk of infection, prolonged ventilation, and increased morbidity. Administering medication or increasing sedation without addressing the underlying cause of the high-pressure alarm will not resolve the problem and could mask further deterioration.",
