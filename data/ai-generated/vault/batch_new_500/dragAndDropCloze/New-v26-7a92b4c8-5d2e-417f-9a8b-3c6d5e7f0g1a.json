The first nursing action is always to assess the patient and the circuit to rapidly identify the cause. Common causes of obstruction include mucus plugging or kinked tubing. Given the severe signs of cardiopulmonary compromise (rising CVP, tachycardia), an emergent needle thoracostomy is the anticipated life-saving intervention. The VAP bundle, including HOB elevation and oral care, are crucial preventative measures for all ventilated patients.",

A tension pneumothorax causes air to become trapped in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse and mediastinal shift, which compresses the heart and great vessels.
