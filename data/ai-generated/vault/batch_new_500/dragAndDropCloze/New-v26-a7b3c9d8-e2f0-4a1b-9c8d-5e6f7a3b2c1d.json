An empty bottle of sertraline was found at the scene.\nB: Client has a history of PTSD and depression diagnosed two years ago post-deployment. He reports significant distress following a recent relationship breakup and is facing potential disciplinary action at work. Client reports feeling isolated since his unit returned, stating 'most of my buddies have moved on,' indicating a potential lack of social support. He lives alone in the barracks.\nA: On arrival, client was drowsy, GCS 12. BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO₂ 94% on room air. Mild tremors noted. Skin cool and clammy. Activated charcoal administered. Now more alert, GCS 15. He denies current suicidal ideation but states, 'I just feel hopeless.'\nR: Admitted to inpatient psychiatric unit.
