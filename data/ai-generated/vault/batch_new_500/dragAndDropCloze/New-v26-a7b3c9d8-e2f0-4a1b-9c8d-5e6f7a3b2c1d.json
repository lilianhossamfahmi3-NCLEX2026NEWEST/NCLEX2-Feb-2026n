    "correct": "The correct order of interventions prioritizes safety and assessment. Establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial for building trust and rapport, facilitating open communication. Initiating suicide precautions ensures the patient's immediate safety. A thorough suicide risk assessment helps determine the severity and nature of the risk, guiding further interventions. Medication safety protocol prevents future overdose attempts. Developing a safety plan empowers the patient with coping strategies and resources to use during crises.",
    "incorrect": "Altering the order of these interventions can compromise patient safety and the effectiveness of treatment. For example, conducting a risk assessment before establishing a therapeutic relationship might yield inaccurate information due to lack of trust. Delaying suicide precautions increases the risk of self-harm. Implementing medication safety without a risk assessment could miss underlying factors contributing to the overdose. A safety plan is most effective after a thorough assessment and therapeutic connection.",
