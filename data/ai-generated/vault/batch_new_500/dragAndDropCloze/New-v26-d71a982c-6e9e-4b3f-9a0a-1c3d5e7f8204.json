        "correct": "Lactulose is prescribed to reduce ammonia levels in the blood, a key factor in hepatic encephalopathy. The goal is typically 2-3 soft bowel movements per day to eliminate ammonia. Restricting protein intake is crucial because protein breakdown produces ammonia, exacerbating encephalopathy. A high-carbohydrate diet spares protein breakdown, providing energy and supporting liver regeneration. Monitor for signs of increased bleeding, such as petechiae or ecchymosis, due to impaired clotting factor synthesis in liver failure.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect answers demonstrate a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of liver failure and its management. For example, suggesting a high-protein diet would worsen hepatic encephalopathy by increasing ammonia production. Ignoring potential bleeding risks neglects the impaired clotting factor production associated with liver failure. The number of bowel movements is carefully titrated; too few isn't effective, and too many can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.",
