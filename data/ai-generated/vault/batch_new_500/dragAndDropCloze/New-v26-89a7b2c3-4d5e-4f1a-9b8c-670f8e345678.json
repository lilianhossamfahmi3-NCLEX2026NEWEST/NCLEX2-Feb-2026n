He now reports increased weakness, generalized nausea, and feeling unwell.\nO: At 0700, the patient is alert but lethargic. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally. At 0715, new onset of bilateral lower extremity edema (2+ pitting) was noted. Urine output has significantly decreased over the last 12 hours, totaling only 40 mL. EKG shows peaked T waves.\nA: Possible Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) superimposed on underlying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) exacerbation. There is a high concern for hyperkalemia given the EKG findings and lab trends.\nB: The patient's chronic conditions are hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with lisinopril and metformin, respectively. He also uses an albuterol inhaler PRN for mild wheezing. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, inhaled albuterol, famotidine, and ceftriaxone. Pending lab results are being closely monitored, and the physician has been notified immediately regarding the changes in patient status.",

        "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium of 6.8 mEq/L, weakness, nausea, and peaked T waves on EKG - all inferred from the SBAR and Labs). Given the decreased urine output, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and a GFR of 35 mL/min, the most likely underlying cause is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) superimposed on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The priority nursing intervention is to administer medications to reduce the serum potassium level (e.g., calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, insulin/dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly, and/or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body). The patient is at high risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias due to the hyperkalemia, potentially leading to cardiac arrest; therefore, continuous cardiac monitoring, including frequent assessment of EKG changes, is crucial.",
