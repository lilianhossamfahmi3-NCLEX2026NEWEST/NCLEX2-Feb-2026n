Pertinent history includes hypertension managed with lisinopril and type 2 diabetes managed with metformin. Patient lives alone with limited social support and relies on a neighbor for transportation and groceries.\nA: Patient is lethargic but arousable to voice. Vital signs show a trend towards instability: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO2 92% on 2L NC. New onset of 2+ bilateral pitting edema in lower extremities noted at 07:15. Urine output is oliguric, totaling only 40 mL over the past 12 hours. Telemetry shows prominent, peaked T-waves. Recent labs confirm critical hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L) and worsening renal function (Creatinine 3.5 mg/dL). Assessment is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), complicated by life-threatening hyperkalemia.\nR: Dr. Evans notified of all findings immediately. Awaiting orders for hyperkalemia protocol. Recommend STAT renal consult and holding the morning dose of lisinopril. Will continue continuous cardiac monitoring and hourly urine output checks."
