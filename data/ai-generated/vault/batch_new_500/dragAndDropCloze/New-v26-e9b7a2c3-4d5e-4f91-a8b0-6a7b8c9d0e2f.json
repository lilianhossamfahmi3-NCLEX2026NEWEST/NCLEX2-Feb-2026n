History of non-adherence with metformin. Lives alone in a senior apartment complex with limited access to fresh groceries, a known social determinant of health impacting her diabetes management. A: Unresponsive to verbal stimuli, only responsive to painful stimuli. Tachycardic at 125/min, hypotensive at 88/48 mmHg. Skin is hot, dry, with poor turgor. Respirations are 30/min, deep but not Kussmaul. Fingerstick glucose >600 mg/dL. Suspected Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) due to severe hyperglycemia without significant ketosis. R: Initiate large-bore IV access. Begin aggressive fluid resuscitation per protocol. Start continuous regular insulin infusion. Obtain STAT labs including serum chemistry, osmolality, and ABG.

                "explanation": "Correct. As the insulin infusion lowers blood glucose to approximately 200-250 mg/dL, dextrose must be added to the IV fluids. This prevents iatrogenic hypoglycemia while allowing the insulin drip to continue resolving the hyperosmolar state."
