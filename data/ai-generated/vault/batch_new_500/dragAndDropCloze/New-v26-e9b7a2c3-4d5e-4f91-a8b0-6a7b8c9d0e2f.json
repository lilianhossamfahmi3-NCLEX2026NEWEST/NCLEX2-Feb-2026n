She has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. \nB: The patient was found at home by a neighbor, confused and lethargic. Her last known normal state was yesterday morning. There are no known recent illnesses reported. \nA: The patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 bpm, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and hyperthermic with a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C). A rapid glucose check showed a level >600 mg/dL. Her respirations are rapid and deep, indicative of Kussmaul breathing. We suspect Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS). \nR: STAT labs and ECG have been ordered. A normal saline bolus has been ordered to start, along with a continuous insulin infusion. Closely monitor vital signs and neurological status. Anticipate potassium replacement based on lab results. Consider placing an indwelling urinary catheter for accurate monitoring of intake and output. Notify the provider of any significant changes.",

The priority is fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline to address dehydration and improve circulatory volume. Hourly monitoring of serum osmolality is crucial to assess the effectiveness of fluid replacement and prevent rapid fluid shifts and cerebral edema. A continuous infusion of regular insulin is essential to gradually reduce blood glucose levels. Frequent neurological assessments are vital to detect cerebral edema or electrolyte imbalances. As glucose levels decrease, administering a dextrose-containing solution becomes necessary to prevent hypoglycemia, a potential complication of insulin therapy.",

Selecting interventions without considering the underlying pathophysiology of HHS can lead to inappropriate or harmful treatment decisions.
