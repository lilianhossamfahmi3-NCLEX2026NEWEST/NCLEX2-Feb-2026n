        "correct": "Obtaining a STAT CT scan is the highest priority to determine the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and rule out other causes of increased ICP, which will guide further treatment. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce ICP. It should be administered promptly to decrease cerebral edema. Neurological status and vital signs must be closely monitored to detect changes in condition and effectiveness of interventions. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage and reduces ICP. Seizure precautions are important to implement due to the risk of seizures associated with increased ICP and stroke.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect prioritization may lead to delays in critical interventions that could reduce ICP and prevent further neurological damage. For example, administering mannitol before obtaining a CT scan could be detrimental if the patient has a hemorrhagic stroke. Delaying neurological monitoring could result in missed changes in condition, and not implementing seizure precautions increases the risk of injury if a seizure occurs.",

            "trap": "Many students might prioritize interventions that directly address the increased ICP (e.g., mannitol, head elevation) without first obtaining a CT scan to determine the cause of the increased ICP. They may also overlook seizure precautions due to focusing solely on ICP management.",
