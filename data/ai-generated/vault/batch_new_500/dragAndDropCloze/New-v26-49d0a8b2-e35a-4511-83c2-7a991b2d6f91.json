Her blood pressure is significantly [blank1], indicating a possible continuation or worsening of preeclampsia despite delivery and the magnesium sulfate having been discontinued two hours prior. The estimated blood loss (EBL) of 700 mL suggests [blank2], requiring immediate attention and further assessment of the source of bleeding. Administering [blank3] is crucial to contract the uterus, reduce bleeding, and prevent further blood loss. Closely monitor the patient for signs of [blank4], a severe complication of postpartum hemorrhage that can lead to hypovolemic shock and potentially death if not recognized and treated rapidly.

Background: History of preeclampsia diagnosed at 36 weeks gestation, managed with magnesium sulfate during labor. Assessment: At 08:00, patient reports feeling dizzy. Fundus is boggy, located 2 cm above the umbilicus, and displaced to the right. Moderate lochia rubra with clots noted. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22 bpm, SpO2 94% on room air. EBL is estimated at 700 mL. Magnesium sulfate infusion discontinued 2 hours postpartum per protocol. Patient reports 4/10 abdominal pain. Orders include methylergonovine 0.2 mg IM PRN for boggy uterus. Recommendation: Evaluate for postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia complications. Consider further interventions to control bleeding and manage blood pressure. Notify provider of findings.",

    "correct": "Elevated blood pressure is a hallmark sign of preeclampsia, even postpartum. A significant EBL indicates postpartum hemorrhage, requiring prompt intervention. Uterotonic medications like methylergonovine are essential to contract the uterus and control bleeding. Postpartum hemorrhage can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition. If initial interventions fail, blood transfusions or surgical interventions may be necessary.",
    "incorrect": "While normal blood pressure is the goal, the patient's current reading is elevated. While a minimal EBL is ideal, 700mL is above normal. While antibiotics are sometimes used, they are not the priority for hemorrhage. While fluid overload is possible, the priority is addressing the hemorrhage. While pain medication might be needed, it won't stop the bleeding.",
