The estimated blood loss (EBL) of 700 mL suggests [blank2], requiring immediate attention and further assessment of the source of bleeding. Administering [blank3] is crucial to contract the uterus, reduce bleeding, and prevent further blood loss. Closely monitor the patient for signs of [blank4], a severe complication of postpartum hemorrhage that can lead to hypovolemic shock and potentially death if not recognized and treated rapidly.

Fundus is boggy, located 2 cm above the umbilicus, and displaced to the right. Moderate lochia rubra with clots noted. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22 bpm, SpO2 94% on room air. EBL is estimated at 700 mL. Magnesium sulfate infusion discontinued at 06:00 per protocol. Patient reports 4/10 abdominal pain. Orders include methylergonovine 0.2 mg IM PRN for boggy uterus. Recommendation: Evaluate for postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia complications. Consider further interventions to control bleeding and manage blood pressure. Notify provider of findings.",

        "correct": "Elevated blood pressure is a hallmark sign of preeclampsia, even postpartum, due to endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm. A significant EBL indicates postpartum hemorrhage, requiring prompt intervention to prevent hypovolemic shock. Uterotonic medications like methylergonovine are essential to contract the uterus by stimulating smooth muscle, controlling bleeding. Postpartum hemorrhage can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal clotting and bleeding due to the depletion of clotting factors. If initial interventions fail, blood transfusions or surgical interventions may be necessary to restore blood volume and control the source of bleeding.\n\nclinicalPearl: Monitor trends in vital signs and lab values to detect early signs of complications.\nmnemonic: Remember the 4 Ts of postpartum hemorrhage: Tone, Trauma, Tissue, and Thrombin.",
        "incorrect": "While normal blood pressure is the goal, the patient's current reading is elevated, indicating a complication that needs immediate attention. While a minimal EBL is ideal, 700mL is above normal, suggesting significant blood loss requiring intervention. While antibiotics are sometimes used, they are not the priority for hemorrhage; the immediate need is to control bleeding and stabilize the patient. While fluid overload is possible, the priority is addressing the hemorrhage and preventing hypovolemic shock. While pain medication might be needed, it won't stop the bleeding; the focus should be on addressing the underlying cause of the hemorrhage.\n\nquestionTrap: Students may focus solely on the postpartum hemorrhage and overlook the continued risk of preeclampsia complications.
