Magnesium sulfate infusion was discontinued at 06:00, two hours postpartum. Estimated blood loss (EBL) at delivery was 350 mL, with an additional 350 mL noted since. Total EBL is 700 mL. Client lives in a rural area with limited access to follow-up care, which was a concern during prenatal visits.\nA: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22/min, SpO2 94% on room air. Fundus is boggy, located 2 cm above the umbilicus, and displaced to the right. Lochia rubra is moderate with several small clots expressed during fundal massage.\nR: Notify provider of significant findings. Continue frequent vital signs and fundal assessments. Prepare for administration of uterotonic medications and potential need for antihypertensives. Anticipate order for stat labs."
