His 0600 report indicates that he remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with the following settings: FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 cm H2O, Rate 14, Tidal Volume 450 mL. At 0615, the high-pressure alarm sounded. I performed suctioning, which resolved the alarm briefly, but it quickly returned. At 0630, I noted decreased breath sounds on the left side. His current vital signs are BP 140/88, HR 98, RR 14 (ventilated), SpO2 92%. ABGs from 0600 show: pH 7.32, PaCO2 55, PaO2 65, HCO3 26. At 0645, I noticed asymmetrical chest rise. The doctor was notified, and I am concerned about a possible pneumothorax. At 0700, a new order was received to obtain a chest x-ray STAT.",
