        "correct": "Initiating frequent neurological monitoring is paramount to detect early signs of hepatic encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening complication of liver failure caused by elevated ammonia levels. Lactulose is the primary medication used to reduce ammonia levels by promoting its excretion in the stool. Sodium restriction is essential to manage ascites and edema, which are common in liver failure due to decreased albumin and increased aldosterone. Pancreatic enzyme replacement is necessary to improve digestion and absorption of nutrients in patients with pancreatitis, as the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient enzymes. \n\nclinicalPearl: Asterixis (flapping tremor) is a classic sign of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitor serum ammonia levels to assess the effectiveness of lactulose therapy. Fluid restriction may be necessary in addition to sodium restriction to manage ascites.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying neurological monitoring can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, potentially resulting in coma and death. Administering pancreatic enzymes before addressing elevated ammonia levels and ascites is less urgent as it primarily addresses nutrient absorption, not the immediate threats to neurological and cardiovascular function. While sodium restriction is important, it is secondary to addressing the immediate neurological threat posed by elevated ammonia and the need for close monitoring.\n\nquestionTrap: The trap is prioritizing interventions based on familiarity rather than urgency. Many students may immediately think of ascites management (sodium restriction) or enzyme replacement without recognizing the imminent danger of hepatic encephalopathy. Focus on the patient's neurological status and lab values (ammonia level) to identify the most immediate threats to the patient's well-being. Apply the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and prioritize interventions that address those areas first.",
