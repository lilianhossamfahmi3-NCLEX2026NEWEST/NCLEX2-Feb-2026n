        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is: 1. Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to promote orthostatic hypotension and reduce blood pressure. This helps to decrease venous return and subsequently lower blood pressure. 2. Identify and remove the triggering stimulus, most commonly bladder distension or bowel impaction. Addressing the cause is crucial to resolving the episode of autonomic dysreflexia. Common triggers include a full bladder, constipation, or skin irritation. 3. Administer antihypertensive medication (e.g., hydralazine) if blood pressure remains elevated despite initial interventions. Hydralazine is a vasodilator that helps to lower blood pressure quickly. 4. Continuous monitoring is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and detect any changes in the patient's condition. Further interventions may be necessary based on the patient's response. Close monitoring allows for timely adjustments to the treatment plan.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing or selection of interventions can delay treatment and worsen the patient's condition. Failing to elevate the head of the bed can impede the reduction of blood pressure. Administering medication before attempting to identify and remove the stimulus may only mask the underlying problem and not address the root cause. Neglecting continuous monitoring prevents timely recognition of complications and the need for further interventions. Prioritizing medication before positioning and stimulus removal is a common error because it doesn't address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia.",
