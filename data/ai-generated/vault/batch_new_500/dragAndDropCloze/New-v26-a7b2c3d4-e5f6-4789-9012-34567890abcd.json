This step ensures the correct concentration of heparin in the IV solution. \n2. The infusion rate should be set to 24 mL/hour to deliver the prescribed dose. Calculation: (1200 units/hour) / (25,000 units/500 mL) = 24 mL/hour. Accurate infusion rate is crucial for therapeutic effect and preventing complications.\n3. At the prescribed infusion rate, the heparin dose Mr. Jones will receive per minute is 20 units. Calculation: (1200 units/hour) / (60 minutes/hour) = 20 units/minute. Knowing the per-minute dose helps in understanding the immediate effect of the medication.",
