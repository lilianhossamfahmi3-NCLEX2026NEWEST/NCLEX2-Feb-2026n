    "sbar": "S: John Smith, a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, was admitted three days ago for pneumonia. He now reports increasing weakness, nausea, and a significant decrease in urine output since 06:00 this morning. His current medications include IV antibiotics (Ceftriaxone) and oral hypoglycemics (Metformin). B: Mr. Smith's history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which are being managed with medications. He initially responded well to treatment for pneumonia but has recently deteriorated. A: The patient is alert but increasingly lethargic. His 13:00 vital signs are concerning: BP 160/90, HR 110, RR 24, and SpO2 92% on 2L NC. Lab results are alarming, showing a creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL), potassium of 6.8 mEq/L, and BUN of 60 mg/dL. An EKG reveals peaked T waves, indicative of hyperkalemia. O: I have contacted nephrology stat and am preparing for potential dialysis. I have held potassium-sparing medications as ordered. Continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring is in place. I will notify the MD immediately of any changes in mental status or EKG findings. The MD was notified at 13:15 of the concerning changes.",

    "correct": "The patient's rapid increase in creatinine and BUN, along with decreased urine output, strongly suggests acute kidney injury (AKI). The elevated potassium (hyperkalemia) poses an immediate threat to cardiac function, necessitating prompt intervention. Administering calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane and prevents arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia. Addressing the hyperkalemia is the priority to prevent life-threatening complications.",
    "incorrect": "While chronic kidney disease (CKD) can present with similar lab values, the acute onset and recent changes point more towards AKI. Focusing solely on fluid overload or sodium levels neglects the immediate danger of hyperkalemia. Although sodium polystyrene sulfonate can lower potassium levels, calcium gluconate acts faster to protect the heart.",
