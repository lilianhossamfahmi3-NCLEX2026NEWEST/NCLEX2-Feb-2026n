He was brought in by a concerned friend from his unit.\n\nB: Client reports a recent, difficult combat deployment ended two months ago. He has a history of mild depression, for which he was prescribed sertraline but discontinued it due to perceived stigma within the military. He lives alone in an off-base apartment and reports significant social isolation and feelings of guilt and hopelessness. He states, 'I just don't see a way out. The faces...they keep coming back.' Client reports poor nutritional intake, relying on fast food due to lack of energy to cook, suggesting a potential social determinant of health barrier.\n\nA: Alert and oriented x4. Client is pacing, hypervigilant, with pressured speech. Affect is constricted. He denies a specific suicide plan but endorses passive thoughts of 'not wanting to be here anymore.' Vitals are trending towards tachycardia and hypertension. Toxicology screen is negative.\n\nR: Recommend immediate implementation of suicide precautions, a comprehensive psychiatric risk assessment, and a stat consultation with the on-call psychiatrist. Maintain 1:1 observation until the evaluation is complete."
