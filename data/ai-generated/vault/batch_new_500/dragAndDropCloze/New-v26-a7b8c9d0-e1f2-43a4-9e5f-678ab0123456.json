B: Patient reports a recent breakup with his girlfriend of 2 years yesterday and not receiving a promotion he anticipated. He has no known psychiatric history but reports increased stress over the past month. A: Patient is visibly distressed, tearful, and reports 'not wanting to be here anymore.'

R: I recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation and initiation of suicide precautions. He may benefit from short-term anxiolytic medication.",

Initiating suicide precautions is SECOND, ensuring patient safety by removing potentially harmful objects and constant observation. Contacting the on-call psychiatrist is THIRD to obtain a formal mental health evaluation and treatment plan. Administering prescribed PRN lorazepam is FOURTH to manage acute anxiety symptoms *after* assessing suicide risk and ensuring safety. Encouraging verbalization of feelings is LAST because while supportive, it is not the immediate priority when assessing suicide risk.",
