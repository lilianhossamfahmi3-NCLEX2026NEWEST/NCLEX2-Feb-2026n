    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes client safety and effective secretion removal. 0900: Hyper-oxygenating with 100% O2 (o1) before suctioning creates an oxygen reserve to mitigate suction-induced hypoxia. 0901: Inserting the catheter without suction (o2) minimizes trauma to the tracheal mucosa. 0902: Applying intermittent suction while rotating and withdrawing (o3) effectively removes secretions without prolonged mucosal contact. 0903: Oxygenating and allowing rest (o4) between suction passes allows the client to recover and prevents desaturation. 0904: Assessing lung sounds and heart rate (o5) evaluates the effectiveness of the suctioning and identifies any adverse effects.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to hyper-oxygenate increases the risk of hypoxemia. Applying suction during insertion can damage the tracheal lining. Omitting rest periods can lead to client fatigue and desaturation. Assessing the client before intervening does not address the immediate need for airway clearance.",
