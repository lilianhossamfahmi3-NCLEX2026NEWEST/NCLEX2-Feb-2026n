        "correct": "The correct order prioritizes client safety and effective secretion removal while minimizing complications. Hyper-oxygenating with 100% FiO2 (o1) before suctioning creates an oxygen reserve to prevent suction-induced hypoxemia. Inserting the catheter without suction (o2) minimizes trauma to the tracheal mucosa. Applying intermittent suction while rotating and withdrawing (o3) effectively removes secretions without prolonged mucosal contact, limiting each pass to 10-15 seconds to prevent hypoxia. Re-oxygenating and allowing rest (o4) between suction passes allows the client to recover and prevents desaturation. Assessing lung sounds, oxygen saturation, and heart rate (o5) evaluates the effectiveness of the suctioning and identifies any adverse effects.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to hyper-oxygenate increases the risk of hypoxemia. Applying suction during insertion can damage the tracheal lining. Omitting rest periods can lead to client fatigue and desaturation. Assessing the client before intervening does not address the immediate need for airway clearance.

Ensure proper catheter size to prevent airway obstruction. Pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO2 for at least 30 seconds before suctioning.",
