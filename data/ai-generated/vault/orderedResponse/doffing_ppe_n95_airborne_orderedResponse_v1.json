    "correct": "The correct doffing sequence prioritizes removing the most contaminated items first while protecting the airway. \n\n(1) **Gloves:** These are the most contaminated and should be removed first to prevent further spread of pathogens. \n\n(2) **Goggles/Face Shield:** These protect the eyes and face from splashes or sprays. Remove carefully to avoid self-contamination.\n\n(3) **Gown:** Unfasten the gown and pull it away from the body, rolling it inside out to contain contaminants.\n\n(4) **Hand Hygiene:** Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing the gown to eliminate any pathogens that may have come into contact with the hands.\n\n(5) **N95 Respirator:** *Exception for Airborne Precautions.* The N95 respirator must remain on until the nurse is outside the room with the door closed. This prevents inhalation of any residual airborne particles. Remove by touching only the straps.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Airborne precautions are implemented when pathogens are small enough to remain suspended in the air for extended periods (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Removing the N95 inside the room could expose the nurse to these pathogens, leading to infection. The closed door minimizes airflow and potential for airborne particles to escape.\n",
    "incorrect": "Removing the N95 mask while still inside the room with a client on airborne precautions is a critical safety failure, increasing the risk of pathogen inhalation and subsequent infection.",
