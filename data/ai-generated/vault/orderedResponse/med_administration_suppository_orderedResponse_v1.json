    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures proper administration and medication absorption.\n\n(1) **Positioning (Left Sims'):** The left Sims' position provides optimal access to the rectum and promotes relaxation of the anal sphincter, facilitating easier insertion.\n\n(2) **Lubrication:** Applying a water-soluble lubricant minimizes friction and reduces the risk of trauma to the rectal mucosa during insertion. Avoid oil-based lubricants as they can interfere with medication absorption.\n\n(3) **Insertion:** Inserting the suppository past the internal anal sphincter (3-4 inches in adults) ensures that the medication is placed high enough in the rectum for optimal absorption. The internal anal sphincter is involuntary and must be passed for proper placement.\n\n(4) **Placement against Rectal Wall:** Placing the suppository against the rectal wall allows for direct contact with the rectal mucosa, facilitating absorption. Inserting the suppository into stool will impede absorption.\n\n(5) **Maintaining Position:** Remaining side-lying for 5-10 minutes allows the suppository to dissolve and be absorbed by the rectal mucosa, preventing expulsion before effective absorption.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to discomfort, trauma, or ineffective medication delivery. For example, inserting the suppository without lubrication can cause pain and tissue damage. Failing to insert the suppository past the internal anal sphincter may result in expulsion. Placing the suppository into stool will prevent absorption.",
