    "correct": "NPA insertion provides a patent airway. \n\n(1) **Measure from the tip of the nose to the earlobe to ensure correct size:** Correct sizing is crucial to prevent the NPA from being too short (ineffective) or too long (potentially stimulating the gag reflex or causing trauma). An appropriately sized NPA ensures the distal tip reaches the base of the tongue without entering the esophagus. \n\n(2) **Lubricate the airway with a water-soluble lubricant:** Lubrication is essential to minimize friction and prevent trauma to the nasal mucosa during insertion. Water-soluble lubricants are preferred to avoid aspiration of oil-based products. \n\n(3) **Tilt the head back slightly and insert the airway with the bevel facing the septum:** Tilting the head back slightly facilitates visualization and alignment of the nasal passage. Inserting the NPA with the bevel facing the septum (the midline cartilage dividing the nostrils) minimizes the risk of mucosal damage and bleeding. The bevel should point towards the larger, more open side of the nasal passage.\n\n(4) **Follow the floor of the nose until the flange is resting against the nostril:** Following the natural curvature of the nasal floor reduces the likelihood of encountering resistance or causing injury to the turbinates. The flange should rest snugly against the nostril to ensure proper placement and prevent the NPA from migrating.\n\n(5) **Verify patency by checking for air movement and breath sounds:** Auscultate bilaterally for equal breath sounds. Observe for chest rise and fall. This confirms that the NPA is effectively maintaining an open airway and facilitating adequate ventilation. If air movement is not detected, reposition the NPA or consider alternative airway management techniques.",
    "incorrect": "Using an NPA in a client with a suspected basilar skull fracture is contraindicated due to the risk of intracranial placement. This is a critical safety point. Other incorrect options may lead to trauma, aspiration, or ineffective airway management.",
