    "correct": "Nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) insertion maintains a patent airway.\n\n(1) **Measure the distance from the tip of the client's nose to their earlobe to determine the correct NPA size:** Accurate sizing prevents the NPA from being too short (ineffective) or too long (potentially stimulating the gag reflex or causing trauma). An appropriately sized NPA ensures the distal tip reaches the base of the tongue without entering the esophagus.\n\n(2) **Lubricate the outside of the NPA with a water-soluble lubricant:** Lubrication minimizes friction and prevents trauma to the nasal mucosa during insertion. Water-soluble lubricants are preferred to avoid aspiration of oil-based products.\n\n(3) **Slightly tilt the client's head back and insert the NPA with the bevel facing the nasal septum:** Tilting the head back facilitates visualization and alignment of the nasal passage. Inserting the NPA with the bevel facing the septum (the midline cartilage dividing the nostrils) minimizes the risk of mucosal damage and bleeding. The bevel should point towards the larger, more open side of the nasal passage.\n\n(4) **Advance the NPA, following the floor of the nose, until the flange rests against the nostril:** Following the natural curvature of the nasal floor reduces the likelihood of encountering resistance or causing injury to the turbinates. The flange should rest snugly against the nostril to ensure proper placement and prevent the NPA from migrating.\n\n(5) **Assess for airway patency by observing for air movement and auscultating for breath sounds:** Auscultate bilaterally for equal breath sounds. Observe for chest rise and fall. This confirms that the NPA is effectively maintaining an open airway and facilitating adequate ventilation. If air movement is not detected, reposition the NPA or consider alternative airway management techniques.",
    "incorrect": "Using an NPA in a client with a suspected basilar skull fracture is contraindicated due to the risk of intracranial placement. This is a critical safety point. Other incorrect options may lead to trauma, aspiration, or ineffective airway management.",
