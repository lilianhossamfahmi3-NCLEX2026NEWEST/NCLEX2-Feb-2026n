(1) **Assess the client's blood pressure and heart rate:** This is the *Situation* assessment. Determining the client's current physiological state is paramount to understanding the immediate impact of the medication error. Antihypertensive overdose can lead to severe hypotension and bradycardia, compromising organ perfusion. (2) **Notify the healthcare provider of the error and the client's status:** This is the *Background* and *Assessment* portion of SBAR. The healthcare provider needs to be informed immediately to determine the appropriate course of action. Providing the client's vital signs and any observed symptoms allows the provider to make an informed decision regarding potential interventions. (3) **Inform the charge nurse or nurse manager of the incident:** This is part of the *Recommendation* and ensures proper escalation and resource allocation. The charge nurse can provide guidance, support, and assist in implementing any necessary interventions. They also play a crucial role in risk management and preventing similar errors in the future. (4) **Complete an internal incident (occurrence) report:** This is the final 'administrative' step for quality improvement and risk management. The incident report documents the details of the error, contributing factors, and actions taken. This information is used to identify trends, implement preventative measures, and improve patient safety protocols.",
