Obtaining blood samples for liver enzymes, platelet count, and CBC is the initial priority to confirm HELLP syndrome and assess the severity of the condition. Magnesium sulfate is administered to prevent seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, making it the next priority. Assessing deep tendon reflexes and monitoring for magnesium toxicity ensures patient safety during magnesium sulfate administration. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter and monitoring hourly urine output is important to assess renal perfusion and fluid balance, aiding in evaluating the severity of preeclampsia. Preparing for potential delivery is the final step as HELLP syndrome often necessitates delivery to prevent further maternal and fetal complications.",

BP 160/110 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. +3 patellar reflexes, +1 edema. Fetal heart rate 140 bpm. Reports decreased fetal movement. 07:15 Labs pending: CBC, CMP, liver enzymes. 07:20 Magnesium sulfate bolus ordered STAT. 07:25 Indwelling urinary catheter to be placed. 07:30 MD notified of labs pending and magnesium order initiated. 07:35 Frequent VS checks initiated q15 min. 07:40 Monitoring for magnesium toxicity initiated per protocol. Recommendation: STAT labs, administer magnesium sulfate, monitor for toxicity, hourly urine output, prepare for potential delivery if condition worsens. Continuous fetal monitoring is in place.
