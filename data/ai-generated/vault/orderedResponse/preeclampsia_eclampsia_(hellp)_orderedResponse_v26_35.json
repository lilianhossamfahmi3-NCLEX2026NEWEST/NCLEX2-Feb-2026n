Obtaining blood samples for liver enzymes, platelet count, and CBC is the initial priority to confirm HELLP syndrome and assess the severity of the condition. Elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count are hallmarks of HELLP. Magnesium sulfate is administered to prevent seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, making it the next priority. Assessing deep tendon reflexes and monitoring for magnesium toxicity ensures patient safety during magnesium sulfate administration. Decreased reflexes can indicate toxicity. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter and monitoring hourly urine output is important to assess renal perfusion and fluid balance, aiding in evaluating the severity of preeclampsia. Preparing for potential delivery is the final step as HELLP syndrome often necessitates delivery to prevent further maternal and fetal complications. Delivery is often the definitive treatment.",

Background: History of preeclampsia in prior pregnancy. At 07:00, BP was 160/110 mmHg. The patient reports a severe headache, blurred vision, and epigastric pain. Assessment: At 07:05, the patient is alert and oriented but anxious. BP 160/110 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. +3 patellar reflexes, +1 edema. Fetal heart rate 140 bpm. The patient reports decreased fetal movement. At 07:15, labs are pending: CBC, CMP, liver enzymes. At 07:20, a magnesium sulfate bolus is ordered STAT. At 07:25, an indwelling urinary catheter is to be placed. At 07:30, the MD was notified of pending labs and the initiated magnesium order. At 07:35, frequent VS checks were initiated q15 min. At 07:40, monitoring for magnesium toxicity was initiated per protocol. Recommendation: Order STAT labs, administer magnesium sulfate, monitor for toxicity, monitor hourly urine output, and prepare for potential delivery if the condition worsens. Continuous fetal monitoring is in place. Be prepared for a possible emergent cesarean section if maternal or fetal status declines. Repeat labs in 6 hours to assess for disease progression or improvement.",
