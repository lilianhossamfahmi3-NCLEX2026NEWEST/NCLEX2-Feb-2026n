        "correct": "Incentive spirometry promotes lung expansion and prevents atelectasis by encouraging deep, sustained inhalations.\n\n1.  **Sit upright (high-Fowler's) and exhale normally:** High-Fowler's position (60-90 degrees) maximizes diaphragmatic excursion and lung expansion. Exhaling normally prepares the client for a full, deep inhalation.\n\n2.  **Place the mouthpiece in the mouth and form a tight seal with the lips:** A tight seal ensures that all inhaled air is drawn through the spirometer, maximizing its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **Inhale slowly and deeply until the piston reaches the goal level:** Slow, deep inhalation promotes even distribution of air throughout the lungs, opening alveoli and preventing collapse. The goal level is determined by the healthcare provider based on the client's lung capacity.\n\n4.  **Hold the breath for 2-3 seconds:** Holding the breath allows for maximal gas exchange (oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal) in the alveoli. This sustained inflation helps to prevent alveolar collapse.\n\n5.  **Remove the mouthpiece and exhale slowly:** Slow exhalation prevents airway collapse and allows for efficient removal of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Postoperative clients are at risk for atelectasis due to anesthesia, pain, and decreased mobility. These factors can lead to shallow breathing and reduced lung expansion. Incentive spirometry helps to counteract these effects by promoting deep, sustained inhalations, which increase alveolar ventilation and prevent alveolar collapse.",
        "incorrect": "Instructing the client to blow *into* the spirometer is a common error; it is an *inspiratory* device. Blowing into the device will not achieve the desired therapeutic effect of expanding the alveoli.",

            "Encourage the client to use the device 10 times every hour while awake. Coughing after use is expected and beneficial, as it helps to clear secretions from the airways. Monitor the client for signs of hyperventilation (dizziness, tingling) and adjust the technique as needed. Document the volume achieved with each use to track progress.",

Patient instructed on proper technique, including upright positioning, tight seal around mouthpiece, slow deep inhalation, breath hold, and slow exhalation. Goal set at 1000 mL. Patient able to achieve 800 mL on first attempt. Encouraged to continue hourly. Lung sounds auscultated: scattered rhonchi bilaterally. Will continue to monitor and encourage IS use.",
