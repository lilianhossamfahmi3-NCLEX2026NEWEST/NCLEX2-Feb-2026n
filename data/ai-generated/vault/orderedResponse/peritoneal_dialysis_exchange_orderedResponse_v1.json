    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures effective and safe peritoneal dialysis. First, the effluent (used dialysate) is drained from the peritoneal cavity to remove accumulated waste products and excess fluid. Next, the tubing is flushed with new dialysate to eliminate air and potential contaminants, preventing infection and air embolism. Then, warmed dialysate is instilled into the peritoneal cavity by gravity. Warming the dialysate prevents vasoconstriction and abdominal cramping, promoting optimal diffusion. The dialysate remains in the peritoneal cavity for the prescribed dwell time, allowing for the exchange of solutes and fluid across the peritoneal membrane. Finally, the tubing is clamped and disconnected using sterile technique to minimize the risk of peritonitis.",
    "incorrect": "Reversing the order can lead to complications such as infection, air embolism, and ineffective dialysis. Instilling dialysate before draining the effluent prevents waste removal. Using un-flushed tubing increases the risk of introducing air or contaminants into the peritoneal cavity. Using cold dialysate can cause severe abdominal cramping and vasoconstriction, reducing the effectiveness of the exchange. Prematurely disconnecting the system disrupts the dialysis process.",
