  "stem": "A 62-year-old male, weighing 70 kg, was rescued from a house fire with full thickness burns covering 40% of his body. The patient presents with signs of smoke inhalation, including wheezing and soot in the nares. He is alert but disoriented. Vital signs are concerning, with a heart rate of 120, blood pressure of 90/60, and respiratory rate of 28. Oxygen saturation is 92% on a non-rebreather mask. The medical team needs to initiate fluid resuscitation using the Parkland formula. Place the following steps for calculating the initial fluid infusion rate in the correct order, ensuring accurate fluid management to prevent complications such as hypovolemic shock or fluid overload. Precise calculation is essential for this critical burn patient to maintain adequate organ perfusion and support recovery during the initial resuscitation phase. The patient's condition requires immediate and accurate application of the Parkland formula to optimize outcomes and minimize potential harm. The team must work swiftly and efficiently to address the patient's needs.",

    "correct": "The Parkland formula is: 4 mL x % TBSA x body weight (kg). First, calculate the total fluid volume required in the first 24 hours: 4 mL x 40% x 70 kg = 11200 mL. Next, calculate the fluid volume to be administered in the first 8 hours: 11200 mL / 2 = 5600 mL. Then, calculate the infusion rate for the first 8 hours: 5600 mL / 8 hours = 700 mL/hr. Finally, calculate the infusion rate for the remaining 16 hours: 5600 mL / 16 hours = 350 mL/hr.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect order of operations or misapplication of the Parkland formula will result in incorrect infusion rate calculations. Failing to calculate total fluid volume correctly impacts subsequent calculations. Reversing the hourly rate calculations or omitting the weight conversion also leads to errors. Remember to divide the total fluid volume by two, with half given in the first 8 hours and the remainder over the next 16 hours.",
