(1) Donning clean gloves and performing hand hygiene prior to removing the old dressing minimizes the risk of introducing microorganisms into the wound. (2) Sterile gloves and hand hygiene are crucial for maintaining asepsis during the irrigation procedure. (3) Filling a syringe with sterile irrigation solution and attaching an angiocatheter prepares the irrigation equipment. (4) Irrigating from the cleanest area to the dirtiest utilizes gravity to facilitate the removal of contaminants and prevent recontamination of the cleansed area. This technique minimizes the risk of infection. (5) Patting the surrounding skin dry with sterile gauze prevents maceration, which can compromise skin integrity and increase the risk of infection.",
