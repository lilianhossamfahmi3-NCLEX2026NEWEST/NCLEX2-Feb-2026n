    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures asepsis and effective wound cleansing. (1) **0900:** Donning clean gloves and hand hygiene prior to removing the old dressing minimizes the risk of introducing microorganisms into the wound. (2) **0902:** Sterile gloves and hand hygiene are crucial for maintaining asepsis during the irrigation procedure. (3) **0905:** A 35-mL syringe with a 19-gauge angiocatheter provides optimal pressure (8 psi) for removing debris without damaging granulation tissue. This pressure effectively cleanses the wound without causing trauma. (4) **0907:** Irrigating from the cleanest area to the dirtiest utilizes gravity to facilitate the removal of contaminants and prevent recontamination of the cleansed area. This technique minimizes the risk of infection. (5) **0910:** Patting the surrounding skin dry with sterile gauze prevents maceration, which can compromise skin integrity and increase the risk of infection.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences compromise asepsis and irrigation effectiveness. Irrigating from the bottom up allows gravity to wash contaminants into the clean area, increasing infection risk. Using incorrect equipment may result in inadequate irrigation pressure or tissue damage. Failing to dry the surrounding skin can lead to maceration and skin breakdown.",
