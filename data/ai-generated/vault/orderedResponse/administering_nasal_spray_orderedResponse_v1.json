        "correct": "Correct nasal spray technique maximizes medication delivery to the nasal mucosa for optimal therapeutic effect. \n\n(1) **Blow the nose gently to clear the nasal passages:** This removes mucus and debris, allowing the medication to directly contact the nasal mucosa for absorption. Mucus acts as a barrier, hindering drug absorption and reducing efficacy. \n\n(2) **Tilt the head forward slightly and insert the bottle tip into one nostril:** Tilting the head forward prevents the medication from draining down the throat, which can lead to systemic absorption and reduced local effect. Inserting the tip ensures targeted delivery to the nasal passages.\n\n(3) **Close the other nostril with a finger:** Occluding one nostril ensures that the medication is inhaled solely through the nostril receiving the spray, maximizing drug concentration in that nasal passage.\n\n(4) **Inhale through the nose while firmly depressing the spray bottle:** Simultaneous inhalation and spray administration ensures the medication is drawn deep into the nasal passages, reaching the target tissues. Firm depression delivers the correct dose.\n\n(5) **Exhale through the mouth and avoid blowing the nose for several minutes:** Exhaling through the mouth prevents the medication from being expelled from the nasal passages. Avoiding blowing the nose allows the medication to remain in contact with the nasal mucosa for optimal absorption.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing will reduce the effectiveness of the medication and may lead to systemic absorption or irritation.\n\n* If the nose is not cleared first, the medication will not be absorbed properly.\n* Tilting the head back can cause the medication to drain down the throat, leading to systemic absorption and reduced local effect.\n* Failure to close the other nostril can result in medication escaping from the other nostril, reducing the dose delivered to the intended nostril.\n* Blowing the nose immediately after administration will expel the medication before it can be absorbed.",

Understanding of medication purpose and potential side effects is [Level of understanding].\nRecommendation: Provide step-by-step instruction on proper nasal spray technique. Reinforce the importance of clearing the nasal passages, tilting the head forward, and avoiding blowing the nose immediately after administration. Assess client's understanding and ability to demonstrate the technique correctly. Schedule follow-up to assess adherence and effectiveness."
