    "correct": "Central venous catheter (CVC) removal poses a risk of air embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication. The steps are ordered to minimize this risk. (1) Positioning the client supine and performing the Valsalva maneuver increases central venous pressure. This elevated pressure helps prevent air from being drawn into the circulatory system during catheter removal. The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure, which in turn increases central venous pressure. (2) Removing the sutures and slowly pulling the catheter out of the vein should be done steadily and coordinated with the client's breath-hold. This minimizes the size of the opening and the duration it is exposed to atmospheric pressure. (3) Applying immediate pressure with a sterile gauze pad for at least 5 minutes helps to seal the venipuncture site and prevent hematoma formation. Direct pressure occludes the vessel and allows for clot formation. (4) Applying a sterile occlusive (airtight) dressing to the site creates a barrier that prevents air from entering the subcutaneous tract. Petroleum-based gauze is often used for its occlusive properties. (5) Verifying the catheter tip is intact ensures that no fragments have broken off and entered the bloodstream, which could lead to further complications. Documentation provides a record of the procedure and any relevant observations.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to air embolism. Removing the catheter without the Valsalva maneuver or in an upright position can create negative pressure, drawing air into the vein. Failing to apply immediate pressure or an occlusive dressing can also allow air entry. Not verifying the catheter tip can result in a retained fragment.",
    "answerBreakdown": [],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Instruct the client to remain supine for 30 minutes after removal to ensure the tract is fully sealed. Monitor vital signs closely for any signs of air embolism (e.g., sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension). Ensure adequate pain management as needed to facilitate client cooperation with positioning and breath-holding."
