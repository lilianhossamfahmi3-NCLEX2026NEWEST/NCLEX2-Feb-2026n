    "correct": "Central venous catheter (CVC) removal poses a risk of air embolism. The steps are ordered to minimize this risk. (1) Positioning the client supine and performing the Valsalva maneuver increases central venous pressure, preventing air from being drawn into the circulatory system during catheter removal. (2) Removing the sutures and slowly withdrawing the catheter should be coordinated with the client's breath-hold to minimize the opening and exposure to atmospheric pressure. (3) Applying immediate pressure with a sterile gauze pad for at least 5 minutes helps seal the venipuncture site and prevent hematoma formation. (4) Applying a sterile occlusive dressing creates a barrier preventing air entry. (5) Verifying the catheter tip is intact ensures no fragments have broken off and entered the bloodstream.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to air embolism. Removing the catheter without the Valsalva maneuver or in an upright position can create negative pressure, drawing air into the vein. Failing to apply immediate pressure or an occlusive dressing can also allow air entry. Not verifying the catheter tip can result in a retained fragment.",
