        "correct": "1. **Assess breath sounds and chest excursion:** This is the initial step to establish a baseline and identify any immediate issues like pneumothorax or asymmetrical breathing, which can quickly become life-threatening. Assessing provides a foundation for subsequent interventions.\n\n2. **Evaluate arterial blood gas (ABG) results:** ABGs provide crucial information about the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance. Evaluating ABGs allows for targeted adjustments to ventilator settings. In ARDS, it's critical to assess PaO2, PaCO2, and pH to guide further interventions. This step informs the necessary adjustments to improve respiratory function.\n\n3. **Adjust FiO2 to maintain SpO2 between 88-92%:** Maintaining adequate oxygen saturation is vital. The target SpO2 range of 88-92% is often used in ARDS to balance oxygen delivery with the risk of oxygen toxicity. Titrating FiO2 is essential to achieve this balance. Aiming for lower SpO2 can prevent hyperoxia and related complications. This adjustment optimizes oxygen delivery while minimizing potential harm.\n\n4. **Increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) as prescribed:** PEEP helps to keep alveoli open and improves gas exchange by preventing alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. Increasing PEEP can improve oxygenation, but it must be done cautiously to avoid barotrauma. Higher PEEP can recruit more alveoli, improving oxygenation. Careful titration is essential to maximize benefit and minimize risk.\n\n5. **Administer prescribed sedative medication:** Sedation is typically administered after ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Sedatives reduce patient anxiety and promote synchrony with the ventilator, which in turn improves the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation. This is essential for comfort but should come after ensuring respiratory stability. Sedation facilitates ventilator synchrony and patient comfort once respiratory parameters are optimized.",

        "SBAR": "07:00, Nurse Jones calling from ICU regarding Mr. Smith in room 201. He is a 55-year-old male admitted yesterday with ARDS secondary to pneumonia. His condition has deteriorated overnight.\n\nBackground: Mr. Smith was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation yesterday. Initial settings were FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, tidal volume 450 mL. He initially responded well, but over the last few hours, his oxygen saturation has been decreasing despite increasing FiO2.\n\nAssessment: Currently, his SpO2 is 87% despite FiO2 at 60%. Respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min, and he appears restless and agitated. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. ABG from 06:30 shows pH 7.30, PaCO2 50 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend we evaluate his ventilator settings, particularly increasing PEEP, and consider a low dose sedative like lorazepam to improve his tolerance of the ventilator. Please review and advise.",
