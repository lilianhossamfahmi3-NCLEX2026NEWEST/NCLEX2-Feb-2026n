        "correct": "The correct sequence for donning PPE minimizes the risk of contamination. First, perform hand hygiene to remove transient microorganisms from the hands, preventing their transfer to the PPE. Next, put on the gown to provide a protective barrier for the body, preventing contact with potentially infectious materials. Then, put on the N95 respirator, which is crucial for airborne precautions, filtering out airborne particles and protecting the respiratory tract. Ensure it is properly fit-tested to ensure a tight seal. After the respirator, put on goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes from splashes or sprays of infectious materials. Finally, put on gloves, which provide a barrier for the hands and cover the cuffs of the gown to prevent skin exposure.",
