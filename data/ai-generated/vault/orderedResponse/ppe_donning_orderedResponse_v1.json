    "correct": "The correct sequence for donning PPE minimizes the risk of contamination. 0800: Hand hygiene is the first step to remove transient microorganisms from the hands, preventing their transfer to the PPE. 0801: The gown provides a protective barrier for the body, preventing contact with potentially infectious materials. 0802: The N95 respirator is crucial for airborne precautions, filtering out airborne particles and protecting the respiratory tract. It must be properly fit-tested to ensure a tight seal. 0803: Goggles or a face shield protect the eyes from splashes or sprays of infectious materials. 0804: Gloves are the final step, providing a barrier for the hands and covering the cuffs of the gown to prevent skin exposure.",
