    "correct": "The correct order for abdominal assessment is inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation (IAPP). (1) Inspection provides a baseline visual assessment of the skin, contour, and symmetry. (2) Auscultation is performed before palpation or percussion because these maneuvers can stimulate bowel sounds, leading to inaccurate findings. (3) Percussion helps to assess the size and density of abdominal organs, as well as the presence of fluid or gas. (4) Light palpation is performed to identify areas of tenderness or superficial masses. (5) Deep palpation is used to assess the size and location of deeper organs and to detect deeper masses.",
    "incorrect": "Palpating or percussing before auscultating can artificially increase bowel sounds, leading to inaccurate assessment. Performing deep palpation before light palpation can cause unnecessary discomfort and guarding, making it difficult to assess for superficial tenderness or masses.",
