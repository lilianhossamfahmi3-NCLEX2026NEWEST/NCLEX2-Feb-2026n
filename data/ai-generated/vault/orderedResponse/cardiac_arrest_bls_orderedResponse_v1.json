    "correct": "Following current Basic Life Support (BLS) guidelines, the sequence prioritizes circulation (C-A-B): Compressions, Airway, Breathing. \n\n1. **Verify Scene Safety and Responsiveness:** Ensures the rescuer's safety and confirms the need for intervention. \n2. **Call for Help/Activate Emergency Response:** Early activation ensures advanced medical care arrives promptly.\n3. **Check Pulse and Breathing:** Assess for signs of circulation and respiration simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds. Absence confirms cardiac arrest.\n4. **Perform High-Quality Chest Compressions:** Initiate chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute and a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) but no more than 2.4 inches (6 cm) for adults. Effective compressions circulate blood to vital organs.\n5. **Provide Rescue Breaths:** Deliver two rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. Each breath should be delivered over 1 second and cause visible chest rise. This provides oxygenation.\n6. **Use AED:** Apply and operate an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) as soon as it becomes available. Follow the AED's prompts. Defibrillation is crucial for terminating ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), the most common causes of sudden cardiac arrest. The electrical shock depolarizes the heart muscle, allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to regain control and restore a normal rhythm.",
