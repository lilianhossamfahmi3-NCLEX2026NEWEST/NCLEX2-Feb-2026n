        "correct": "Correct enema administration minimizes discomfort and prevents complications.\n\n(1) **Left Sims' Position:** This position facilitates the flow of the enema solution by gravity, as it follows the natural anatomical curve of the sigmoid colon and rectum. This allows for optimal distribution of the fluid and promotes effective bowel evacuation.\n\n(2) **Lubricate the Tip:** Lubrication of the enema tube tip is crucial to minimize friction and prevent trauma to the rectal mucosa during insertion. This reduces the risk of irritation, bleeding, and discomfort for the client.\n\n(3) **Insert the Tube:** Inserting the tube 7.5-10 cm (3-4 inches) into the rectum, directing it towards the umbilicus, ensures that the tip passes beyond the anal sphincter and into the rectum without causing injury. The direction follows the natural anatomical path of the lower digestive tract.\n\n(4) **Raise the Bag:** Elevating the enema bag to a height of 30-45 cm (12-18 inches) above the anus creates sufficient gravitational force to facilitate a steady and controlled flow of the enema solution. This height is optimal for achieving the desired cleansing effect without causing excessive pressure or discomfort.\n\n(5) **Retain the Fluid:** Instructing the client to retain the fluid for as long as possible (ideally 5-10 minutes) allows the enema solution to adequately soften the stool and stimulate peristalsis, promoting effective bowel evacuation. The longer the fluid is retained (within safe limits), the more effective the cleansing process.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect enema administration can lead to discomfort, injury, or ineffective bowel evacuation. Inserting the tube too far can cause perforation. Raising the bag too high can cause rapid infusion and cramping. Failing to lubricate can cause trauma.",
