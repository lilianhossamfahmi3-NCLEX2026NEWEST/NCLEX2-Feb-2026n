            "SBAR": "Situation: J.B. is a 62-year-old male admitted 3 days ago following a fall, resulting in a traumatic brain injury. He is currently intubated and sedated with propofol.\nBackground: The initial CT scan revealed a small subdural hematoma. Neurologically stable until the last hour. Baseline GCS was 8. PMH includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include propofol, fentanyl, and labetalol.\nAssessment: At 10:45, vital signs are BP 150/95, HR 58, irregular respirations of 10. Pupils are sluggishly reactive, with the right pupil slightly larger than the left. The patient grimaces to painful stimuli. ICP monitoring shows an upward trend. A small amount of blood is noted around the ETT.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about increasing ICP and possible Cushing's Triad. I recommend notifying the neurosurgeon immediately, considering a repeat CT scan, and evaluating the need to increase sedation or administer osmotic diuretics. Please provide orders.",

The priority is to immediately notify the neurosurgeon to facilitate prompt intervention. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP. While pain can increase ICP, addressing the Cushing's Triad is the immediate priority, but administering fentanyl is appropriate if agitation is contributing to ICP. Administering labetalol is important to lower the blood pressure, a component of Cushing's Triad, but should be done after notifying the provider and elevating the HOB. Preparing for intubation and hyperventilation may be necessary to manage increased ICP, but it is lower on the priority list than the interventions that address the immediate threat of herniation. Hyperventilation should only be initiated with an order from the neurosurgeon.",
