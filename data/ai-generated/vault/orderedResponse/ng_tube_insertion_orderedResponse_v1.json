    "correct": "(0800) Correct order is crucial to prevent complications. (1) Measuring from nose to earlobe to xiphoid process (NEX) estimates insertion depth, minimizing risk of lung placement. (2) Initial neutral/slightly back head position facilitates entry into the nasopharynx. (3) Chin-to-chest position closes the trachea and opens the esophagus, guiding the tube correctly. (4) Swallowing propels the tube down the esophagus. (5) Chest X-ray is the gold standard for confirming placement in the stomach, ruling out lung placement. Gastric pH <5.5 supports gastric placement, but X-ray is definitive. Pathophysiology: Bowel obstruction causes distention and potential vomiting, necessitating NG tube insertion for decompression and symptom relief. Incorrect placement can lead to aspiration pneumonia.",
    "incorrect": "(0800) Incorrect sequencing increases the risk of complications such as tracheal intubation or esophageal perforation. Auscultation is unreliable for confirming placement. Relying solely on pH without X-ray confirmation can lead to misplacement.",

      "(0800) Clinical Pearl: If the client coughs, gags, or exhibits respiratory distress (e.g., cyanosis, decreased SpO2) during insertion, immediately withdraw the tube slightly and reassess. This indicates potential tracheal placement.",
