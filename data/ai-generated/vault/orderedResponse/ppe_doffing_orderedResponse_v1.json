    "correct": "The correct order for doffing PPE minimizes the risk of self-contamination.  Gloves are removed first as they are considered the most contaminated (0900). Removing gloves first prevents transfer of contaminants to other PPE or the healthcare worker's hands. Next, goggles or a face shield are removed (0901). The gown is then removed, peeling it away from the body to avoid contact with contaminated surfaces (0902). The mask or respirator is removed last to continue respiratory protection until the healthcare worker is safely away from the patient environment (0903). Finally, hand hygiene is performed to remove any remaining pathogens (0904). This sequence ensures a systematic approach to minimizing exposure to infectious agents.",

    "pathophysiology": "Contact and droplet precautions are implemented to prevent the spread of infectious agents transmitted through direct contact or respiratory droplets.  PPE acts as a barrier to prevent the healthcare worker from becoming infected.  The doffing sequence is crucial because improper removal can lead to self-contamination and subsequent infection.  For example, removing gloves last could transfer pathogens to the face or other surfaces.  The rationale behind removing the gown before the mask is to minimize the risk of contaminating the respiratory tract during gown removal.  Hand hygiene is the final step to eliminate any remaining pathogens on the hands, preventing further transmission."
