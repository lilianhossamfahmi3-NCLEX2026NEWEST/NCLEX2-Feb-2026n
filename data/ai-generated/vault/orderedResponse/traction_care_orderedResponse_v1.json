        "correct": "**S:** The client is in Buck's skin traction.\n**B:** Buck's traction is used to reduce muscle spasms and immobilize fractures, often of the hip, prior to surgery. Maintaining proper traction is crucial to prevent complications.\n**A:** The priority actions are:\n1. **Neurovascular Assessment (0700):** Assess circulation, movement, and sensation (CMS) distal to the traction site. Neurovascular compromise can lead to permanent damage if not addressed promptly. Impaired circulation can result from pressure on blood vessels due to the fracture or the traction itself. Nerve compression can cause numbness, tingling, or paralysis.\n2. **Skin Assessment (0705):** Assess the skin under the traction boot for signs of breakdown. Prolonged pressure can lead to pressure ulcers. Skin breakdown increases the risk of infection and delays healing.\n3. **Weight Assessment (0710):** Ensure weights hang freely. Weights that are resting on the floor or bed are ineffective and can compromise traction. Ineffective traction can lead to malunion or delayed healing of the fracture.\n4. **Rope and Pulley Assessment (0715):** Ensure ropes are correctly seated and moving smoothly. Improperly aligned or obstructed ropes can alter the line of pull and reduce the effectiveness of the traction.\n**R:** Continuous neurovascular assessment and skin monitoring are essential to prevent complications. Maintaining the integrity of the traction setup ensures its therapeutic effectiveness.\n\n**Deep Pathophysiology Rationale:** Buck's traction applies a pulling force to the limb to reduce muscle spasms and immobilize the fracture. Neurovascular compromise can occur due to swelling, direct pressure from the fracture fragments, or constriction from the traction boot. Ischemia can develop within hours, leading to irreversible nerve and muscle damage. Pressure ulcers develop due to prolonged pressure exceeding capillary closing pressure, leading to tissue hypoxia and necrosis. Proper weight and rope alignment ensure the correct amount of force is applied along the intended line of pull, maximizing therapeutic benefit and minimizing the risk of complications.",
