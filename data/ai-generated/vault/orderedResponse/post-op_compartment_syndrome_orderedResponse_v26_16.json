      "correct": "The priority in suspected compartment syndrome is to rapidly assess and intervene to prevent permanent tissue damage. Option 2: A thorough pain assessment using the PQRST method (Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Region/Radiation, Severity, Timing) helps differentiate the pain from typical post-operative pain. Option 5: Assessing the 6 P's (Pain, Pulselessness, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pressure) is crucial to identify neurovascular compromise. Option 4: Loosening constrictive dressings or casts reduces external pressure contributing to the syndrome. Option 1: Elevating the extremity to heart level may help improve venous return and reduce edema without compromising arterial flow. Option 3: Prompt notification of the healthcare provider is essential for potential surgical intervention (fasciotomy) to relieve pressure.",

A: Neurovascular assessment reveals significant pain (8/10) in the lower leg, increased swelling, and pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot. Distal pulses are present but diminished compared to the unaffected leg. Capillary refill is slightly prolonged. Client is reporting numbness and tingling in the foot. Pain medication (morphine) was administered at 09:00 with minimal relief. R: Possible compartment syndrome. Recommend immediate evaluation by the surgical team for possible fasciotomy. Monitoring neurovascular status every hour. Consider pain medication adjustment. Contact information for surgeon on call is [redacted]. Client is anxious and asking for assistance. Request immediate assessment and intervention to prevent further complications from suspected compartment syndrome. The surgical site is clean, dry, and intact. Vital signs stable except for reported pain levels.",
