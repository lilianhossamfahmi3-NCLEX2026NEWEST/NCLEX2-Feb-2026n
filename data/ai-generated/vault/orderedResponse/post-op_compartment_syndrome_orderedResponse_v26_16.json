        "correct": "The priority in suspected compartment syndrome is to rapidly assess and intervene to prevent permanent tissue damage. Option 2: A thorough pain assessment using the PQRST method (Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Region/Radiation, Severity, Timing) helps differentiate the pain from typical post-operative pain. This helps determine if the pain is disproportionate to the injury. Option 5: Assessing the 6 P's (Pain, Pulselessness, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pressure) is crucial to identify neurovascular compromise indicative of compartment syndrome. Option 4: Loosening constrictive dressings or casts reduces external pressure contributing to the syndrome and improves circulation. Option 1: Elevating the extremity to heart level may help improve venous return and reduce edema without compromising arterial flow. Elevating above the heart can reduce arterial flow. Option 3: Prompt notification of the healthcare provider is essential for potential surgical intervention (fasciotomy) to relieve pressure and prevent permanent damage.",

B: Client admitted for ORIF of a closed tibia fracture following a motor vehicle accident yesterday. PMH: Hypertension, controlled with lisinopril. No known drug allergies. A: Neurovascular assessment reveals significant pain (8/10) in the lower leg, increased swelling compared to earlier assessment, and pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot. Distal pulses are present but diminished compared to the unaffected leg. Capillary refill is slightly prolonged at 3 seconds. Client is reporting numbness and tingling in the foot. Dressing is intact, but appears tight. R: Possible acute compartment syndrome. Recommend immediate evaluation by the surgical team for possible fasciotomy. Continuous monitoring of neurovascular status. Consider alternative pain management. Surgeon on call has been notified. Request immediate assessment and intervention to prevent further complications. The surgical site is clean, dry, and intact. Vital signs stable except for reported pain levels.",
