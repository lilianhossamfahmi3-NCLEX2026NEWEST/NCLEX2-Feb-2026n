        "correct": "Maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and addressing Cushing's triad are critical in managing increased ICP. Positioning to promote venous drainage is the initial step to reduce ICP. Administering prescribed medications such as mannitol helps reduce cerebral edema. Hyperventilating the patient can acutely lower PaCO2, causing vasoconstriction and reducing ICP, but it requires careful monitoring and is typically a later intervention. Finally, notifying the healthcare provider is essential to inform them of the changes and implement further interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Positioning is the first step to promote venous drainage and reduce ICP. Administering medications before positioning delays immediate ICP management. Hyperventilating without addressing positioning and medication is less effective and can cause further complications. Notifying the provider before attempting initial interventions delays immediate management of the increased ICP. Administering mannitol before positioning does not address the immediate need to reduce ICP. Hyperventilation is not the first action, as it can cause cerebral vasoconstriction if not carefully monitored. Notifying the provider should occur after initial interventions have been attempted. Hyperventilating before addressing positioning and administering medications may not be the most effective initial approach.",
