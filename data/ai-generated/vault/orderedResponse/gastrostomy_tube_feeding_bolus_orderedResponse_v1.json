    "correct": "Performing bolus enteral feeding safely minimizes aspiration risk and maintains tube patency.\n\n(1) **Elevate the head of the bed to at least 30 to 45 degrees:** This position utilizes gravity to reduce the risk of gastric reflux and subsequent aspiration into the lungs. Aspiration can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious complication.\n\n(2) **Verify tube placement and check for gastric residual volume:** Tube placement verification (e.g., pH testing of aspirate) ensures the feeding enters the stomach, not the respiratory tract. Checking gastric residual volume (GRV) assesses gastric emptying. High GRV (typically >250-500 mL, per facility policy) indicates delayed gastric emptying, increasing aspiration risk. Hold the feeding and notify the provider if GRV is elevated per protocol.\n\n(3) **Flush the tube with 30 mL of water:** Flushing before feeding clears the tube, ensuring patency and preventing clogging. Use sterile water, especially in immunocompromised patients.\n\n(4) **Administer the prescribed feeding by gravity using a syringe:** Gravity administration allows for a controlled flow rate, reducing the risk of abdominal cramping, distension, and diarrhea. Avoid using the syringe plunger to force the feeding, as this can cause discomfort and increase the risk of complications.\n\n(5) **Flush the tube with an additional 30 mL of water after the feeding:** Post-feeding flushing clears any remaining feeding from the tube, preventing bacterial growth and occlusion.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to aspiration, tube occlusion, or inaccurate assessment of gastric emptying. Administering the feeding before elevating the head of the bed significantly increases aspiration risk. Failing to check tube placement can result in pulmonary administration of the feeding.",

      "Always return the gastric residual to the stomach (unless contraindicated by facility policy or provider order) to prevent electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia) and metabolic alkalosis. Gastric secretions contain electrolytes and hydrochloric acid, which are essential for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance.",
      "Monitor for signs of intolerance, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, or constipation. Adjust the feeding rate or concentration as prescribed to improve tolerance.",
      "Maintain meticulous skin care around the gastrostomy tube insertion site to prevent skin breakdown and infection. Cleanse the site daily with mild soap and water, and assess for signs of redness, swelling, or drainage."
