    "correct": "Gastric lavage, or stomach pumping, is a procedure used to remove ingested substances from the stomach. It's most effective when performed within one hour of ingestion. \n\n**(1) Position the client in the left lateral decubitus position (head down):** This position minimizes the risk of aspiration by utilizing gravity to keep stomach contents from entering the airway. The head-down tilt further aids in preventing aspiration.\n\n**(2) Insert a large-bore orogastric tube and verify placement:** A large-bore tube (36-40 Fr) is necessary to effectively remove pill fragments and other particulate matter. Placement must be verified via auscultation while injecting air, pH testing of aspirate (pH should be ≤5), or X-ray if necessary, to ensure the tube is in the stomach and not the respiratory tract.\n\n**(3) Instill 200–300 mL of room-temperature saline into the stomach:** Room-temperature saline is used to avoid inducing hypothermia. Smaller volumes are instilled to prevent forcing the ingested substance further into the small intestine.\n\n**(4) Aspirate the stomach contents or allow them to drain by gravity:** After instillation, the stomach contents are aspirated using a large syringe or allowed to drain by gravity. This removes the ingested substance and the instilled saline.\n\n**(5) Continue the intervals until the returned fluid is clear:** The instillation and aspiration process is repeated until the returned fluid is clear, indicating that most of the ingested substance has been removed. Monitor the client closely for complications such as aspiration, esophageal perforation, and electrolyte imbalances.",
    "incorrect": "Gastric lavage is contraindicated in certain situations, such as ingestion of corrosive substances (acids or alkalis) or hydrocarbons, as it can cause further damage to the esophagus. It is also generally not recommended if more than one hour has passed since ingestion, as the substance may have already moved into the small intestine. Lavage can cause aspiration, esophageal perforation, and electrolyte imbalances. Using incorrect technique or improper positioning can increase the risk of complications.",

      "Have suction equipment and a tracheal intubation kit at the bedside. The greatest risk during lavage is pulmonary aspiration. Monitor for signs of aspiration, such as coughing, choking, or respiratory distress. Be prepared to provide immediate respiratory support if needed.",
