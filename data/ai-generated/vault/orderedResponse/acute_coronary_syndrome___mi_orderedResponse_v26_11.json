            "correct": "The initial priority for a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is to ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent further myocardial ischemia. Administering oxygen via nasal cannula addresses this need by increasing the available oxygen to the myocardium. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is the next critical step to rapidly identify any ST-segment elevation or other ECG changes indicative of myocardial infarction, guiding further treatment. Establishing IV access is essential for administering medications and fluids quickly and efficiently. Sublingual nitroglycerin is administered to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood flow, relieving chest pain by reducing myocardial workload. Morphine sulfate is used for pain relief if nitroglycerin is ineffective, and also helps reduce anxiety and myocardial oxygen demand, further stabilizing the patient. Each step is crucial in the acute management of ACS to minimize myocardial damage and improve patient outcomes.",

            "SBAR": "**07:00**\nSituation: John Smith, a 62-year-old male, presented to the ED at 06:30 with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm. Pain started approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He appears anxious and diaphoretic.\n\nBackground: Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, diagnosed 5 years ago. He reports experiencing similar episodes of chest pain in the past, but this episode is more intense. He takes lisinopril 20mg PO daily and atorvastatin 40mg PO daily. No known allergies. Last meal was at 05:00.\n\nAssessment: Patient is alert and anxious. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Patient describes pain as 8/10 on pain scale. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally. Peripheral pulses are present but weak. Skin is cool and clammy.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention for suspected acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This includes oxygen administration to maintain SpO2 >95%, pain management, cardiac monitoring, and urgent cardiology consult for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Repeat ECG should be performed after nitroglycerin administration. Initiate STEMI protocol immediately.",
