            "correct": "The initial priority for a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is to ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent further myocardial ischemia. Administering oxygen via nasal cannula addresses this need. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is the next critical step to rapidly identify any ST-segment elevation or other ECG changes indicative of myocardial infarction. Establishing IV access is essential for administering medications and fluids. Sublingual nitroglycerin is administered to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood flow, relieving chest pain. Morphine sulfate is used for pain relief if nitroglycerin is ineffective, and also helps reduce anxiety and myocardial oxygen demand.",

Pain started approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival.\n\nBackground: Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He reports experiencing similar episodes of chest pain in the past, but this episode is more intense. He takes lisinopril 20mg daily and atorvastatin 40mg daily. No known allergies.\n\nAssessment: Patient is alert and anxious. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Patient describes pain as 8/10 on pain scale. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds. \n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention for suspected acute myocardial infarction. This includes oxygen administration, pain management, cardiac monitoring, and consideration for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiology has been notified. Repeat ECG should be performed after nitroglycerin administration. Initiate protocol for STEMI.",
