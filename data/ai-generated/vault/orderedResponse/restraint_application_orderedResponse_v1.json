    "correct": "Restraint application requires a systematic approach to ensure patient safety and legal compliance. **(1) 0900:** A clinical justification for restraint use must be established, and a healthcare provider's order verified before application. This ensures the intervention is medically necessary and legally sound. **(2) 0902:** Padding bony prominences (e.g., wrists) minimizes the risk of skin breakdown and pressure injuries caused by the restraint. **(3) 0905:** Applying the restraint to the wrist while ensuring two fingers can fit underneath prevents constriction and circulatory impairment. This ensures adequate blood flow to the extremity. **(4) 0907:** Securing the restraint straps to the bed frame (not the side rails) using a quick-release knot allows for rapid removal in case of emergency. The bed frame moves with the client, minimizing the risk of injury. **(5) 0910:** Frequent neurovascular checks (every 15-30 minutes) are crucial to monitor for signs of impaired circulation or nerve damage (e.g., pallor, cyanosis, numbness, tingling). Document findings meticulously. Failure to follow these steps can lead to serious complications, including injury, nerve damage, and legal repercussions.",
    "incorrect": "Tying restraints to the side rails is a major safety violation because the rails can be lowered/raised, potentially causing limb fracture or strangulation. This action compromises patient safety and is considered a 'Never Event'. Failing to obtain a physician's order prior to restraint application, when possible, violates patient rights and legal standards. Inadequate padding can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers. Tight restraints can impair circulation, leading to ischemia and nerve damage. Infrequent neurovascular checks can delay the detection of complications, resulting in permanent injury.",
