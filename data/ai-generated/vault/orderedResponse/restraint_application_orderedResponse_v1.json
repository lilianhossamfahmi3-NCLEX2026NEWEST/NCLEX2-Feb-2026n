    "correct": "The correct order reflects the steps necessary for safe and legally compliant restraint application. **(1) Obtain Order:** A healthcare provider's order based on a clinical justification is paramount before applying restraints. This ensures medical necessity and legal authorization. **(2) Pad Bony Prominences:** Padding minimizes the risk of skin breakdown and pressure injuries. **(3) Apply Restraint:** Applying the restraint with enough space for two fingers prevents circulatory impairment. **(4) Secure to Bed Frame:** Securing to the bed frame with a quick-release knot allows for rapid removal in emergencies and prevents injury if the bed position is changed. **(5) Neurovascular Checks:** Frequent neurovascular checks are essential to monitor for complications like impaired circulation or nerve damage. Document findings meticulously.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to patient harm and legal issues. Applying restraints without a valid order is illegal and unethical. Failing to pad bony prominences increases the risk of skin breakdown. Applying restraints too tightly can impair circulation and cause nerve damage. Securing restraints to the side rails poses a safety hazard. Infrequent neurovascular checks can delay the detection of complications.",
