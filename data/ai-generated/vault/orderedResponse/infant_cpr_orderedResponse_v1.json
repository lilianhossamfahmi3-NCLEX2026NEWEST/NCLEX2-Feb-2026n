    "correct": "Infant CPR follows the CAB sequence (Circulation, Airway, Breathing). (1) Assess for a brachial pulse and breathing simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds. The brachial pulse is the standard for infants because the carotid artery in the neck is often difficult to palpate accurately due to the infant's short neck and surrounding tissue. (2) If no pulse or a pulse less than 60 bpm with signs of poor perfusion, begin high-quality chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, compressing approximately 1.5 inches (4 cm). (3) Open the airway using a head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver, ensuring a neutral head position to avoid obstructing the airway. Over-extension can collapse the infant's compliant trachea. (4) Deliver 2 rescue breaths, ensuring a tight seal over both the infant's nose and mouth to prevent air leakage. Each breath should be delivered over 1 second, with enough volume to see the chest rise. (5) Continue chest compressions and rescue breaths in a 30:2 ratio for approximately 2 minutes (about 5 cycles) before reassessing the infant's condition or using an AED if available. This ensures consistent circulation and oxygenation.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to follow the CAB sequence delays critical interventions. Using the carotid pulse for an infant is incorrect and less reliable than the brachial artery. Incorrect compression depth or rate can compromise circulation. Over-extending the infant's neck can obstruct the airway. Insufficient seal during rescue breaths reduces oxygen delivery. Interrupting CPR for prolonged periods reduces the chance of survival.",

      "Remember to call for help or activate the emergency response system immediately after determining the infant is unresponsive. Early activation improves outcomes.",
      "For 2-rescuer infant CPR, the compression-to-breath ratio changes to 15:2, and the 'two thumb-encircling hands' technique is preferred. This technique provides better chest compression depth and generates higher blood pressure.",
      "Avoid excessive ventilation, which can cause gastric distention and increase the risk of aspiration."
