    "correct": "The 'Three Checks' of medication administration are crucial for preventing medication errors. The first check occurs when the medication is removed from the storage area, ensuring the correct drug is selected based on the Medication Administration Record (MAR). The second check happens during preparation, confirming the dose and route align with the MAR. The final check takes place at the client's bedside, verifying the medication, dose, route, and time against the MAR and the client's identity using two identifiers. Documentation occurs *after* administration to accurately reflect what was given. This systematic approach minimizes the risk of administering the wrong medication, dose, or route, ultimately safeguarding patient safety.",
    "incorrect": "Documenting medication administration *before* it occurs ('pre-charting') is a serious breach of nursing standards and can lead to inaccurate records and potential harm to the patient. Each check serves as a critical verification point, and skipping or altering the order increases the likelihood of errors. Failing to check at the bedside could result in administering the medication to the wrong patient or overlooking a change in the patient's condition that contraindicates the medication.",
