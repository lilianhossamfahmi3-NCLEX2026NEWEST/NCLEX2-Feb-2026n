    "correct": "The correct order ensures accurate bladder volume assessment. \n\n(1) **Positioning (o1):**  Placing the client supine and palpating the symphysis pubis provides anatomical landmarks for accurate probe placement.  The symphysis pubis marks the lower boundary of the bladder.  \n\n(2) **Gel Application (o2):** Ultrasound gel is essential for acoustic coupling. It eliminates air between the probe and the skin, allowing sound waves to penetrate tissues and reflect back to the scanner. Without gel, the ultrasound waves are scattered, resulting in a poor image.\n\n(3) **Gender/Anatomy Selection (o3):** Selecting the correct gender/anatomy is crucial for accurate volume calculation. The device uses different algorithms based on whether a uterus is present, as the uterus can be misinterpreted as fluid.  Failure to select the correct anatomy can lead to significant over- or underestimation of bladder volume.\n\n(4) **Probe Placement (o4):**  Placing the probe on the gel and directing it towards the bladder allows for visualization of the bladder.  Slight angulation may be needed to optimize the image.\n\n(5) **Scanning and Centering (o5):** Pressing the scan button initiates the ultrasound. Adjusting the probe to center the crosshairs on the bladder image ensures the scanner is measuring the maximum bladder diameter, leading to the most accurate volume estimation.  The crosshairs represent the focal point of the ultrasound beam.",
