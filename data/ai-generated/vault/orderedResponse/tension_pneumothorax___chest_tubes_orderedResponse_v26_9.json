Background: Admitted two hours ago with multiple rib fractures on the right side. Initial chest x-ray showed a small pneumothorax. Assessment: Increasing respiratory distress, absent breath sounds on the right side, tracheal deviation to the left, and hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg). Heart rate 120 bpm. Oxygen saturation 85% on 100% FiO2 via non-rebreather mask. Recommendation: STAT chest tube insertion to relieve the tension pneumothorax and improve respiratory status. Prepare emergency equipment and personnel.",
