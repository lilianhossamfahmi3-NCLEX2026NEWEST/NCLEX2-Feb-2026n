        "correct": "Sterile gloving technique is crucial to maintain asepsis and prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The correct sequence ensures that sterility is preserved throughout the procedure. (1) The outer glove package is considered non-sterile and protects the sterile inner wrap. (2) Opening the inner wrap carefully prevents contamination of the sterile gloves. (3) 'Skin-to-Cuff' technique: Grasping the folded cuff of the non-dominant glove with the dominant hand ensures that only the inside of the glove (sterile) touches the skin (clean). (4) 'Glove-to-Glove' technique: Sliding the gloved non-dominant hand under the outer cuff of the dominant glove maintains sterility because sterile touches sterile. (5) Adjusting the gloves ensures a proper fit and allows for optimal dexterity during the procedure. Throughout the process, hands must be kept above the waist to avoid contamination.",

        "pathophysiology": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant concern in healthcare settings. Pathogens can be introduced into the body through breaks in sterile technique, leading to localized or systemic infections. Sterile gloving is a critical component of infection control practices, preventing the transfer of microorganisms from the healthcare provider's hands to the patient or sterile equipment. Proper technique minimizes the risk of HAIs and promotes patient safety. Failure to adhere to sterile technique can result in surgical site infections (SSIs), bloodstream infections, and other serious complications, increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs."

The insertion site dressing is soiled and requires changing using sterile technique.\nAssessment: The patient's vital signs are stable. The insertion site shows no signs of infection (redness, swelling, or purulent drainage) at this time, but the dressing needs to be changed to maintain asepsis.\nRecommendation: I recommend donning sterile gloves using proper technique to perform the sterile dressing change. Ensure all supplies are sterile and the patient is educated on the procedure to minimize contamination risk. Monitor the insertion site for signs of infection during and after the dressing change. Document the procedure and any observations."
