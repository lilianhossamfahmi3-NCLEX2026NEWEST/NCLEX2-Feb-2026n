        "correct": "Performing an arterial puncture requires a systematic approach to ensure patient safety and accurate results. \n\n(1) **Perform the Allen test to assess collateral circulation:** The Allen test assesses the patency of the ulnar artery, ensuring adequate blood supply to the hand if the radial artery is compromised. Occluding both arteries, then releasing the ulnar artery while observing for hand flushing, confirms collateral circulation. If adequate collateral circulation is not present, puncturing the radial artery could lead to ischemia and tissue damage.\n\n(2) **Heparinize the syringe (if not pre-packaged) and cleanse the puncture site:** Heparin prevents clotting of the blood sample, ensuring accurate analysis. Cleansing the puncture site with an antiseptic solution minimizes the risk of infection.\n\n(3) **Palpate the radial pulse and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the artery:** Palpating the radial pulse guides needle insertion into the artery. A 45-degree angle facilitates arterial entry while minimizing the risk of passing through the artery.\n\n(4) **Withdraw the needle and apply firm, direct pressure to the puncture site for 5 minutes:** Applying firm, direct pressure immediately after needle withdrawal prevents hematoma formation and bleeding from the arterial puncture site. Arterial pressure is significantly higher than venous pressure, necessitating prolonged pressure.\n\n(5) **Expel air bubbles from the syringe and place the sample on ice:** Air bubbles in the sample can alter the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) readings, leading to inaccurate results. Placing the sample on ice slows down cellular metabolism, preserving the integrity of the blood gases until analysis. Cellular metabolism consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, which would falsely lower the PaO2 and raise the PaCO2 if not slowed.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to inaccurate ABG results, patient injury, or both. Failing to perform the Allen test can cause ischemia. Not heparinizing the syringe can cause clotting. Not applying pressure can cause hematoma. Not icing the sample can alter the results.",
