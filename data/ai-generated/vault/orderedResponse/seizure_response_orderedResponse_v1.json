    "correct": "The priority in seizure management is to protect the client from injury and ensure a patent airway. Following SBAR principles helps structure the response. (1) **Situation:** The client is actively seizing. **Action:** Ease the client to the floor (if not in bed) and clear the area of hazards (o1). This prevents injury from uncontrolled movements. (2) **Background:** Tonic-clonic seizures involve loss of consciousness and muscle rigidity followed by jerking. **Action:** Turn the client to their side (Lateral position) (o2). This prevents aspiration of saliva or emesis. (3) **Assessment:** Restrictive clothing can impede breathing. **Action:** Loosen restrictive clothing around the neck (o3) to facilitate ventilation. (4) **Assessment:** The duration and characteristics of the seizure are crucial for determining the need for intervention and medication administration. **Action:** Monitor the duration and characteristics of the seizure (o4). Note the time the seizure started, the type of movements, and any associated signs (e.g., cyanosis). (5) **Recommendation:** After the seizure, the client will likely be confused and disoriented. **Action:** Reorient the client during the postictal phase (o5) and provide reassurance. Document the event thoroughly, including the seizure duration, characteristics, and postictal state.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions such as inserting objects into the client's mouth or attempting to restrain the client are dangerous and contraindicated. These actions can cause injury to the client and are not part of standard seizure management.
