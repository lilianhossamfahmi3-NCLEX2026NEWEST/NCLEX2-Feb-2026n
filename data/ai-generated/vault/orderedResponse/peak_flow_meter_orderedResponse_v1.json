This deep inspiration increases intrathoracic pressure, which is then forcefully expelled.\n*   **0000:** A tight seal around the mouthpiece prevents air leaks, which would falsely lower the PEF reading. Air leaks reduce the pressure generated during exhalation.\n*   **0000:** A forceful and rapid exhalation generates the PEF, reflecting the maximum speed of airflow. This measures the degree of airway narrowing.\n*   **0000:** Recording the highest of three readings provides the most accurate representation of the client's peak expiratory flow. Multiple attempts account for variability in effort and technique.",
