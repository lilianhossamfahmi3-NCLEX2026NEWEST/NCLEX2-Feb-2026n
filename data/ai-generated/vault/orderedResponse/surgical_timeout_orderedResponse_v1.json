    "correct": "The surgical time-out is a critical safety measure designed to prevent 'Never Events' such as wrong-site surgery. This structured process ensures all team members are aligned and aware of critical information before the procedure begins. The correct order reflects a logical progression of verification steps using the SBAR framework. (1) **Situation (S):** Cease all activity and ensure all team members are present and attentive. This establishes a focused environment for the time-out. (2) **Background (B):** Verify the correct client identity (using two identifiers). This confirms the patient's identity to prevent mistaken identity errors. (3) **Background (B):** Verify the correct surgical site and marking. This ensures the procedure is performed on the intended location. (4) **Assessment (A):** Verify the correct procedure to be performed. This confirms the planned surgical intervention. (5) **Recommendation (R):** Verify that all required implants or radiological data are available. This ensures all necessary resources are present and ready for use. This entire process must be performed immediately before the incision to be effective.",

    "deepPathophysiologyRationale": "Performing a surgical time-out is crucial in preventing wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-person surgeries. These 'Never Events' can have devastating consequences for patients, including physical harm, emotional distress, and even death. The time-out process helps to mitigate these risks by ensuring that all members of the surgical team are aware of the patient's identity, the planned procedure, and the correct surgical site. This collaborative verification process reduces the likelihood of errors and promotes patient safety. The Joint Commission mandates the use of a Universal Protocol, which includes the time-out, to standardize surgical safety practices across healthcare organizations. Failure to adhere to these protocols can result in serious patient harm and legal repercussions.",
