Cushing's triad includes hypertension (often with widened pulse pressure), bradycardia, and irregular respirations. Hyperventilation can temporarily reduce ICP by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and reducing cerebral blood volume. The healthcare provider needs immediate notification for further orders. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that reduces ICP, but it is secondary to immediate respiratory and neurological interventions. Elevating the head of the bed helps promote venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP, but is less critical than immediate interventions. Pain medication is important, but it is the lowest priority in the context of acutely increased ICP and potential herniation. Addressing the ABCs is paramount.",
