      "correct": "The client is likely experiencing Cushing's Triad due to increased ICP. Cushing's triad includes hypertension (often with widened pulse pressure), bradycardia, and irregular respirations. Hyperventilation can temporarily reduce ICP by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and reducing cerebral blood volume. The healthcare provider needs immediate notification for further orders. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that reduces ICP, but it is secondary to immediate respiratory and neurological interventions. Elevating the head of the bed helps promote venous drainage from the brain, reducing ICP, but is less critical than immediate interventions. Pain medication is important, but it is the lowest priority in the context of acutely increased ICP and potential herniation.",

      "SBAR": "07:45\nSituation: Client is a 62-year-old male admitted 2 days ago following a motor vehicle accident with a closed head injury. He has a ventriculostomy for ICP monitoring and drainage.\nBackground: Client's ICP has been trending upwards over the last 4 hours, despite interventions. Current ICP is 24 mmHg. CPP is 68 mmHg. Receiving continuous IV infusion of normal saline at 75 mL/hr. Neuro checks performed every hour.\nAssessment: At 07:00, GCS was 13 (E3, V4, M6). At 07:30, GCS decreased to 9 (E2, V2, M5). Right pupil is now sluggish and dilated to 5 mm, left pupil is 3 mm and reactive. Blood pressure is 180/90 mmHg, heart rate is 50 bpm, and respirations are irregular at 10 breaths/min. Temperature is 37.2°C (99°F). No motor response to pain on the left side.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about possible impending herniation due to the client's decreasing level of consciousness, asymmetric pupillary response, and Cushing's Triad. I recommend immediate evaluation by the neurosurgeon and consideration for further intervention to reduce ICP. Please advise on further management.",
