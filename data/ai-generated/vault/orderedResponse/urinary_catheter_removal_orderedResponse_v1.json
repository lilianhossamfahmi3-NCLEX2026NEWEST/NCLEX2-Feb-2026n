        "correct": "The correct sequence ensures safe and effective catheter removal, minimizing patient discomfort and preventing complications. (1) Hand hygiene and gloves are essential for infection control. (2) Complete balloon deflation is critical; failure to do so can cause significant urethral trauma. Allowing gravity drainage prevents forceful aspiration, which can damage the balloon. (3) A deep breath helps the client relax the pelvic floor muscles, easing catheter withdrawal. (4) Gentle, slow removal minimizes friction and discomfort. (5) Perineal care promotes hygiene and comfort. Monitoring for the first void assesses bladder function and identifies potential urinary retention.",

For example, attempting to remove the catheter before deflating the balloon will cause significant pain and injury.

The client reports mild discomfort in the suprapubic area.\nRecommendation: Monitor the client's urinary output for the next 24 hours. Assess for signs of urinary retention or infection. Encourage adequate fluid intake. Provide pain medication as needed. Educate the client on signs and symptoms to report."
