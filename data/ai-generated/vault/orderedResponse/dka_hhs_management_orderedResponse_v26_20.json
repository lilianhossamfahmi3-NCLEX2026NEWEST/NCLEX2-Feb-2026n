  "stem": "A patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is being treated in the emergency department. The patient presents with altered mental status, Kussmaul respirations, and a fruity breath odor. Lab results reveal a blood glucose of 450 mg/dL, pH of 7.2, HCO3 of 10 mEq/L, and positive serum ketones. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes and reports missing insulin doses due to nausea. Vitals include HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32, and SpO2 94% on room air. Considering these findings, place the following interventions in the correct order of priority to stabilize the patient and address the life-threatening complications of DKA, including severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic acidosis. Prioritize interventions that will rapidly improve the patient's hemodynamic stability and correct the acid-base imbalance. Remember to consider the potential complications of each intervention and how they might impact the patient's overall condition. The goal is to restore fluid volume, correct electrolyte imbalances, lower blood glucose levels, and ultimately resolve the ketoacidosis while preventing complications such as hypokalemia or cerebral edema. Ensure each step contributes to stabilizing the patient's condition and preventing further deterioration.",

    "correct": "DKA management prioritizes addressing life-threatening issues first. Fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) is crucial to correct dehydration and hypovolemia caused by osmotic diuresis. Insulin administration follows to address hyperglycemia and ketogenesis. Potassium replacement is essential to prevent hypokalemia due to insulin's intracellular shift of potassium. Finally, identifying the underlying cause (e.g., infection, missed insulin dose) is important to prevent future episodes.",
    "incorrect": "Administering insulin before addressing fluid deficit can worsen hypovolemia. Potassium replacement is crucial because insulin drives potassium into cells, potentially causing dangerous hypokalemia. Identifying the underlying cause is important for long-term management, but it is not the immediate priority in stabilizing the patient. Waiting to administer insulin can prolong the hyperglycemic state and worsen acidosis. Assessing mental status is important, but only after the initial interventions have begun. The underlying cause of DKA is less important than the immediately life-threatening conditions of acidosis, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance.",
