    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures proper medication delivery and minimizes discomfort. (1) Positioning the child side-lying with the affected ear up allows gravity to assist in the flow of medication into the ear canal. (2) For children under three years old, the ear canal is shorter and more horizontal. Pulling the pinna down and back straightens the ear canal, facilitating medication entry. (3) Instilling drops along the side of the ear canal, rather than directly into the center, helps prevent air bubbles from forming, which can block medication flow. (4) Gently massaging the tragus after instillation helps to move the medication further down the ear canal. (5) Maintaining the side-lying position for a few minutes allows the medication to be fully absorbed and prevents leakage.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to ineffective medication delivery, discomfort, or potential injury. Pulling the pinna 'up and back' is appropriate for adults and children over three, but not for a 2-year-old. Instilling drops directly into the center of the canal can cause discomfort and trap air. Failing to massage the tragus or maintain the side-lying position can reduce medication effectiveness.",
