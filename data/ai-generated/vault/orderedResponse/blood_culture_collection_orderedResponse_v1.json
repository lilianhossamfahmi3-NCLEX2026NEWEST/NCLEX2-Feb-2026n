    "correct": "Following strict aseptic technique is crucial to prevent false-positive blood cultures. \n\n(1) **Identifying two separate venipuncture sites** minimizes the risk of contamination from skin flora and helps differentiate true bacteremia from a contaminant. Drawing from separate sites increases the reliability of the results.\n\n(2) **Cleansing the skin with Chlorhexidine for at least 30 seconds and allowing it to air dry completely** is the gold standard for skin antisepsis. Chlorhexidine disrupts the cell membranes of microorganisms, providing broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The 30-second application and complete air-drying are essential for optimal effectiveness. Premature insertion of the needle before complete drying can reintroduce skin flora into the puncture site.\n\n(3) **Cleansing the tops of the culture bottles with alcohol** removes potential contaminants from the bottle stoppers, which are not sterile. This step further reduces the risk of introducing external microorganisms into the blood culture.\n\n(4) **Withdrawing blood and filling the aerobic bottle first** is essential because the butterfly tubing or syringe may contain air. Aerobic bacteria thrive in the presence of oxygen. \n\n(5) **Filling the anaerobic bottle second** ensures that any air introduced during the collection process does not interfere with the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which do not thrive in oxygen-rich environments.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Bacteremia, the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response. Accurate identification of the causative organism through blood cultures is critical for guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy and improving patient outcomes. Contaminated blood cultures can lead to unnecessary antibiotic use, increased healthcare costs, and potential harm to the patient.",
    "incorrect": "Using the same venipuncture site or drawing from an existing IV line increases the risk of contamination, leading to false-positive results and inappropriate treatment. Inadequate skin antisepsis or failure to allow the antiseptic to dry completely can also introduce contaminants into the blood culture. Drawing the anaerobic bottle before the aerobic bottle can expose anaerobic organisms to oxygen, potentially inhibiting their growth and leading to false-negative results.",

      "Always obtain blood cultures *before* administering the first dose of antibiotics to ensure the growth of the pathogen is not suppressed. Document the time of collection and any antibiotics the patient is currently receiving. If a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is suspected, blood cultures should be drawn from both the central line and a peripheral site simultaneously. Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of sepsis, such as fever, chills, tachycardia, and hypotension.",
      "Consider drawing two sets of blood cultures from different sites simultaneously to improve sensitivity and reduce the likelihood of false-negative results.",
