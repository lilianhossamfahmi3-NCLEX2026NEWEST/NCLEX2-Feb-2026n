        "correct": "Following the correct sequence for eye drop administration ensures medication effectiveness and minimizes the risk of complications.\n\n(1) **Wash hands and don clean gloves:** This prevents the introduction of microorganisms into the eye, reducing the risk of infection. Asepsis is paramount when administering medication, especially to a sensitive area like the eye.\n\n(2) **Tilt the client's head back and pull the lower lid down to expose the conjunctival sac:** Tilting the head back allows gravity to assist in medication distribution. Pulling down the lower lid creates a pouch (the conjunctival sac) to hold the medication, preventing it from immediately running out. This minimizes corneal contact and discomfort.\n\n(3) **Instill the prescribed number of drops into the center of the conjunctival sac:** Instilling drops into the conjunctival sac ensures even medication distribution. Avoid touching the dropper to the eye to prevent contamination and potential corneal injury. The conjunctival sac provides a reservoir for medication absorption.\n\n(4) **Instruct the client to close their eye gently:** Gentle closure prevents squeezing the medication out. Forceful blinking can activate the lacrimal pump, draining medication away and reducing effectiveness. Gentle closure allows medication to remain in contact with the eye surface for optimal absorption.\n\n(5) **Apply gentle pressure to the nasolacrimal duct (inner canthus) for 30-60 seconds:** Applying pressure to the nasolacrimal duct (punctal occlusion) prevents medication from draining into systemic circulation, reducing the risk of systemic side effects, especially with medications like beta-blockers.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to contamination, ineffective medication delivery, and increased risk of systemic absorption. Failing to wash hands increases infection risk. Instilling drops directly onto the cornea can cause discomfort and corneal damage. Omitting punctal occlusion can increase systemic absorption and potential side effects.",
