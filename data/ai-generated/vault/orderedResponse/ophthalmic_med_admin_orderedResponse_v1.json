    "correct": "Following the correct sequence for eye drop administration ensures medication effectiveness and minimizes the risk of complications. \n\n(1) **Wash hands and don clean gloves:** This is crucial to prevent the introduction of microorganisms into the eye, reducing the risk of infection. Maintaining asepsis is paramount when administering any medication, especially to a sensitive area like the eye. \n\n(2) **Tilt the client's head back and pull the lower lid down to expose the conjunctival sac:** Tilting the head back allows gravity to assist in the distribution of the medication. Pulling down the lower lid creates a pouch (the conjunctival sac) that can hold the medication, preventing it from immediately running out of the eye. This minimizes corneal contact and discomfort.\n\n(3) **Instill the prescribed number of drops into the center of the conjunctival sac:** Instilling the drops into the conjunctival sac ensures that the medication is evenly distributed across the eye. Avoid touching the dropper to the eye to prevent contamination of the medication and potential injury to the cornea. The conjunctival sac provides a reservoir for the medication to be absorbed.\n\n(4) **Instruct the client to close their eye gently:** Gentle closure prevents squeezing the medication out of the eye. Forceful blinking can activate the lacrimal pump, which will drain the medication away from the eye and reduce its effectiveness. Gentle closure allows the medication to remain in contact with the eye surface for optimal absorption.\n\n(5) **Apply gentle pressure to the nasolacrimal duct (inner canthus) for 30-60 seconds:** Applying pressure to the nasolacrimal duct, also known as punctal occlusion, prevents the medication from draining into the systemic circulation via the nasolacrimal duct. This reduces the risk of systemic side effects, especially with medications that have systemic absorption potential, such as beta-blockers.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to contamination, ineffective medication delivery, and increased risk of systemic absorption. For example, failing to wash hands increases the risk of infection. Instilling drops directly onto the cornea can cause discomfort and corneal damage. Omitting punctal occlusion can increase systemic absorption and potential side effects.",
    "answerBreakdown": [],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "If administering multiple eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes between medications to prevent the first drop from being washed out. This allows each medication to be absorbed properly.",
      "When administering eye ointment, apply a thin ribbon from the inner to the outer canthus.",
      "Monitor for signs of local irritation, such as redness, swelling, or itching.",
      "Instruct the client to report any systemic side effects, such as changes in heart rate or blood pressure, especially with medications like beta-blockers."
