        "correct": "Ear irrigation requires meticulous technique to prevent complications.\n\n**(1) Assess the ear canal with an otoscope:** Visualizing the tympanic membrane ensures it's intact. Irrigating a perforated eardrum can cause infection and further damage. A healthy tympanic membrane appears translucent and pearly gray. Absence of this indicates a contraindication to irrigation.\n\n**(2) Warm the irrigation solution to body temperature (approximately 37°C or 98.6°F):** Using a solution that is too cold or too hot can stimulate the vestibular system, leading to severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. The inner ear's semicircular canals are highly sensitive to temperature changes. Body temperature minimizes this risk.\n\n**(3) Position the client with the head tilted toward the affected ear with a basin underneath:** This allows gravity to assist with drainage of the irrigant and cerumen. Proper positioning prevents fluid from flowing into the unaffected ear or down the client's neck, enhancing comfort and preventing skin irritation.\n\n**(4) Straighten the ear canal and direct the fluid stream toward the upper wall of the canal:** Straightening the ear canal (pulling the pinna up and back for adults, down and back for children under 3) allows for optimal visualization and access. Directing the stream towards the superior aspect of the canal allows the fluid to flow behind the cerumen, facilitating its removal. Directly aiming at the cerumen can impact it further or damage the tympanic membrane.\n\n**(5) Instruct the client to remain side-lying for several minutes to allow drainage:** This ensures complete drainage of the irrigation solution, preventing discomfort and potential for infection. Residual fluid can create a moist environment conducive to bacterial growth.",
        "incorrect": "Reversing the order or skipping steps can lead to client discomfort, injury, or ineffective cerumen removal. For example, irrigating without assessing the tympanic membrane can cause serious complications if a perforation exists. Using solution that is too hot or cold can cause vertigo. Directing the stream at the cerumen can cause impaction or damage to the tympanic membrane. Failing to allow for adequate drainage can lead to discomfort and infection.",
