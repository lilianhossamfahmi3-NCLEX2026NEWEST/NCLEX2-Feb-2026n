    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures the chest drainage system is safely and effectively prepared before connection to the patient. \n\n(1) **Fill the water seal chamber:** The water seal chamber acts as a one-way valve, preventing air from re-entering the pleural space. Filling it to the specified level (usually 2 cm) establishes this crucial barrier. Insufficient water can compromise the seal, while excessive water can increase resistance to air and fluid drainage.\n\n(2) **Connect the drainage system to the client's chest tube:** After establishing the water seal, the drainage system can be connected to the patient's chest tube. This connection allows for the evacuation of air and fluid from the pleural space, facilitating lung re-expansion.\n\n(3) **Connect the system to the wall suction unit:** Connecting to wall suction, after the water seal is established and the patient is connected, allows for controlled negative pressure to be applied to the system, aiding in drainage. \n\n(4) **Adjust the suction regulator:** The suction regulator on the drainage unit controls the amount of negative pressure applied to the pleural space. Adjusting it to the prescribed setting (e.g., -20 cm H2O) ensures optimal drainage without causing excessive trauma to the lung tissue. Too much suction can damage tissue, while too little may not effectively remove air or fluid.\n\n(5) **Verify the presence of a 'suction-on' indicator:** Confirming the presence of a 'suction-on' indicator (orange bellows or float) visually verifies that the suction is functioning correctly and that the desired negative pressure is being applied to the system. This step ensures that the drainage process is actively working.",
    "incorrect": "Reversing the order of these steps can compromise patient safety and the effectiveness of the chest drainage system. Connecting the system to the patient before establishing the water seal can allow air to enter the pleural space, potentially leading to a pneumothorax. Incorrect suction settings can cause lung damage or ineffective drainage.",
    "answerBreakdown": [],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Gentle bubbling in the water seal chamber is normal with pneumothorax or air leak; continuous vigorous bubbling indicates an air leak in the system.",
      "The drainage collection chamber should be marked at regular intervals (e.g., every hour or shift) to monitor the amount of drainage.",
      "Keep the drainage system below the level of the patient's chest to prevent backflow of drainage into the pleural space."
    ],
    "questionTrap": {
      "trap": "Wall vs. Box Suction",
      "howToOvercome": "Remember that the 'wall' suction must be high enough to make the box work, but the box 'dial' controls the actual pressure in the patient's chest. The wall suction is simply a power source for the drainage system. The drainage system itself regulates the amount of suction applied to the patient's chest."
