        "correct": "The correct sequence ensures the chest drainage system is safely and effectively prepared before and during connection to the patient. \n\n(1) **Fill the water seal chamber:** The water seal chamber acts as a one-way valve, preventing air from re-entering the pleural space. Filling it to the specified level establishes this crucial barrier. Insufficient water can compromise the seal, while excessive water can increase resistance to air and fluid drainage.\n\n(2) **Connect the drainage system to the client's chest tube:** After establishing the water seal, the drainage system can be connected to the patient's chest tube. This connection allows for the evacuation of air and fluid from the pleural space, facilitating lung re-expansion.\n\n(3) **Connect the drainage system to the wall suction unit:** Connecting to wall suction, after the water seal is established and the patient is connected, allows for controlled negative pressure to be applied to the system, aiding in drainage. \n\n(4) **Adjust the suction regulator:** The suction regulator on the drainage unit controls the amount of negative pressure applied to the pleural space. Adjusting it to the prescribed setting ensures optimal drainage without causing excessive trauma to the lung tissue. Too much suction can damage tissue, while too little may not effectively remove air or fluid.\n\n(5) **Verify the presence of a 'suction-on' indicator:** Confirming the presence of a 'suction-on' indicator visually verifies that the suction is functioning correctly and that the desired negative pressure is being applied to the system. This step ensures that the drainage process is actively working.",
        "incorrect": "Reversing the order of these steps can compromise patient safety and the effectiveness of the chest drainage system. Connecting the system to the patient before establishing the water seal can allow air to enter the pleural space, potentially leading to a pneumothorax. Incorrect suction settings can cause lung damage or ineffective drainage.",
