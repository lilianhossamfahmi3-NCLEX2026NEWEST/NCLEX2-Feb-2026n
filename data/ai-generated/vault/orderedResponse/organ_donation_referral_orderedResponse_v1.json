    "correct": "The organ donation process is time-sensitive and ethically regulated. The nurse recognizes the client's imminent death and initiates the organ donation protocol. First, the nurse must immediately notify the local Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) per hospital policy and federal law. This triggers the evaluation process. Next, the OPO determines the client's medical suitability for organ donation based on established criteria, assessing factors like age, medical history, and organ function. Then, if the client is deemed suitable, a designated requestor from the OPO approaches the family to discuss the possibility of organ donation. This conversation is best handled by a trained professional. Finally, throughout the process and especially after consent, the nurse provides ongoing support to the family and maintains the hemodynamic stability of the client to preserve organ viability. This includes managing blood pressure, oxygenation, and fluid balance.",
