    "correct": "The correct sequence ensures safe and effective OPA insertion to maintain airway patency in an unconscious client. \n\n(1) **Measure from the corner of the mouth to the angle of the jaw:** Accurate sizing is crucial. An OPA that is too long can stimulate the gag reflex or obstruct the airway, while one that is too short will not effectively maintain airway patency. \n\n(2) **Open the client's mouth using the cross-finger technique:** This technique allows for safe and controlled opening of the mouth, preventing injury to the nurse and client. \n\n(3) **Insert the OPA with the tip pointing toward the roof of the mouth (upwards):** Inserting the OPA upside down initially allows it to bypass the tongue and minimize the risk of pushing the tongue back into the pharynx, which could cause airway obstruction. \n\n(4) **Advance the OPA until it reaches the soft palate, then rotate 180 degrees:** Rotating the OPA into its correct anatomical position ensures that it curves over the base of the tongue, effectively displacing it and creating an open airway. \n\n(5) **Check for air movement and proper flange position against the lips:** This step confirms proper placement and function of the OPA. Auscultate for bilateral breath sounds and observe chest rise and fall to ensure adequate ventilation. The flange should rest comfortably against the lips without causing pressure or trauma.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences can lead to ineffective airway management, potential trauma, or airway obstruction. Inserting the OPA directly following the curve of the mouth (pointing down) in an adult can push the tongue back and cause obstruction. Skipping measurement can result in improper sizing, leading to gagging or ineffective airway maintenance.",
