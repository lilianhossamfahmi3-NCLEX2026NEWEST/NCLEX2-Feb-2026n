        "correct": "The correct sequence ensures a sterile field is maintained throughout the dressing change, minimizing the risk of infection. (1) **Wash hands and don clean gloves (o1):** This initiates the process with basic hygiene and protects the nurse from the existing dressing. (2) **Inspect the wound and discard the old dressing and clean gloves (o2):** Assessment of the wound is crucial before applying a new dressing. Discarding contaminated materials prevents cross-contamination. (3) **Open the sterile dressing kit and establish a sterile field (o3):** Creating a sterile field provides a dedicated space for the procedure, minimizing the risk of introducing microorganisms. (4) **Don sterile gloves (o4):** Sterile gloves are essential for handling sterile supplies and directly interacting with the wound. (5) **Cleanse the wound using sterile saline and apply the new dressing (o5):** Cleansing removes debris and promotes healing. Applying a sterile dressing protects the wound from external contaminants.",

Microorganisms can enter the wound and proliferate, leading to localized or systemic infection. Sterile technique is crucial to prevent the introduction of pathogens and promote optimal wound healing. Aseptic practices minimize the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), which can delay recovery, increase healthcare costs, and potentially lead to serious complications such as sepsis."
