The client has a history of recurrent UTIs.\nAssessment: The client is able to follow instructions and demonstrates understanding of the clean-catch urine collection procedure. The urine appears cloudy.\nRecommendation: Send the urine specimen to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing. Administer prescribed antibiotics as ordered by the provider. Encourage increased fluid intake and monitor for improvement in symptoms."
