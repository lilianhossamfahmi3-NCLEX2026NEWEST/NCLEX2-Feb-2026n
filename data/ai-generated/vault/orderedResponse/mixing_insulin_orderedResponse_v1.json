    "correct": "The correct order prevents contamination of the Regular insulin with NPH, which could alter its absorption and effectiveness.\n\n1. **Inject air into the NPH (cloudy) insulin vial:** This creates pressure to facilitate withdrawal of the NPH insulin.\n2. **Inject air into the Regular (clear) insulin vial:** This creates pressure to facilitate withdrawal of the Regular insulin.\n3. **Withdraw the Regular (clear) insulin dose:** Regular insulin is drawn up first to avoid contamination with the longer-acting NPH insulin.\n4. **Withdraw the NPH (cloudy) insulin dose:** NPH insulin is drawn up last to complete the mixed dose.\n\nMixing insulins requires meticulous technique to ensure accurate dosing and prevent complications like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Administering the mixed insulin at 0800 allows for predictable glucose control throughout the day, aligning with the patient's meal schedule and metabolic needs.",
    "incorrect": "Reversing the order can lead to NPH contaminating the Regular insulin vial, affecting its rapid action. Drawing up either insulin without first injecting air can create a vacuum, making it difficult to withdraw the correct dose. Withdrawing NPH first could also alter the peak and onset of the regular insulin if contamination occurs.",
