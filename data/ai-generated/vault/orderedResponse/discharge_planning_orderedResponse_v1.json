    "correct": "Discharge planning is a continuous, interdisciplinary process that aims to ensure a smooth and safe transition for the client from the healthcare setting to their home or another care environment. (1) **Initiate discharge planning upon the client's admission:** This allows for early identification of potential needs and challenges. (2) **Identify the client's home support system and potential barriers to care:** Assessing the client's social support, living situation, financial resources, and access to transportation is crucial for addressing potential barriers to adherence to the discharge plan. This step directly addresses health equity and social determinants of health (SDOH). (3) **Coordinate with the case manager for necessary medical equipment:** Collaboration with the case manager ensures that the client has access to necessary medical equipment, home healthcare services, and other resources to support their recovery at home. (4) **Provide written instructions and verify the client's understanding (Teach-back):** Providing clear, concise, and written discharge instructions, and verifying the client's understanding using the teach-back method, is essential for promoting adherence to the treatment plan and preventing readmissions. This includes medication reconciliation and clear instructions on follow-up appointments. (5) **Complete the final discharge summary and document the mode of transport:** The final step involves completing the discharge summary, which includes a summary of the client's hospital stay, medications, follow-up appointments, and other relevant information. Documenting the mode of transport ensures the client's safe arrival at their destination.",
    "incorrect": "Waiting until the day of discharge to start planning is a common error that leads to delayed care, increased anxiety for the patient and family, and potentially poor outcomes. Effective discharge planning requires a proactive and collaborative approach that begins at admission. Failing to assess the patient's needs early can result in unmet needs and increased risk of readmission. Inadequate education and lack of coordination with community resources can also compromise patient safety and well-being.",
