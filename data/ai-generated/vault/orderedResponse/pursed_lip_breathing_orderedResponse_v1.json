    "correct": "Pursed-lip breathing (PLB) is a technique used to control dyspnea and improve oxygenation in clients with COPD. It creates back pressure in the airways during exhalation, preventing premature airway collapse and promoting more effective emptying of the lungs. \n\n(1) **Relax the neck and shoulder muscles:** Reduces accessory muscle use and oxygen demand. Tension exacerbates dyspnea. \n(2) **Inhale slowly through the nose for two counts (mouth closed):** Nasal inhalation warms, humidifies, and filters the air, reducing irritation to the airways. Slow inhalation prevents hyperinflation.\n(3) **Pucker the lips as if preparing to whistle or blow out a candle:** Creates resistance to airflow.\n(4) **Exhale slowly through the pursed lips for four counts:** Prolonged exhalation maintains positive airway pressure, preventing alveolar collapse and facilitating CO2 removal. The 1:2 ratio (inhalation:exhalation) is crucial for effective gas exchange.",
    "incorrect": "Exhaling rapidly or forcing the breath out defeats the purpose of maintaining positive pressure in the bronchioles, leading to airway collapse and ineffective CO2 removal.",
