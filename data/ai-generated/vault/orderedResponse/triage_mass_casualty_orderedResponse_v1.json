        "correct": "In a mass casualty incident (MCI), the START triage system prioritizes 'the greatest good for the greatest number.'\n\n*   **RED (Immediate):** At 0800, the client with a sucking chest wound and respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential death. The compromised respiratory status necessitates rapid treatment to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. A sucking chest wound disrupts the pressure gradient needed for effective respiration, leading to hypoxia.\n*   **YELLOW (Delayed):** At 0805, the client with an open leg fracture, palpable radial pulse, and ability to follow commands has a significant injury but is hemodynamically stable and can follow commands, indicating adequate cerebral perfusion. The fracture requires treatment, but transport can be delayed until immediate threats are addressed.\n*   **GREEN (Minimal):** At 0810, the client with multiple abrasions who is ambulatory (walking) is considered the 'walking wounded' and can assist in the triage process. Their injuries are minor and do not require immediate medical attention.\n*   **BLACK (Expectant):** At 0815, the client with no spontaneous respirations even after airway repositioning is either deceased or has injuries so severe that survival is unlikely with the resources available. In an MCI, resources are focused on saving those with a higher chance of survival.",
        "incorrect": "In standard hospital triage, the most unstable patient is typically treated first. However, in a mass casualty incident (MCI), the focus shifts to maximizing the number of survivors. Therefore, clients who are unlikely to survive with available resources (Black tag) are treated last, not first. This is a critical distinction to understand when applying triage principles in different settings.",
