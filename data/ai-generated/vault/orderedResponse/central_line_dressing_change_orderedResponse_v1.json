        "correct": "Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a significant healthcare concern. Strict adherence to aseptic technique during CVC dressing changes is crucial to prevent infection and complications like air embolism. The correct order of actions ensures a sterile field is maintained throughout the procedure.\n\n1.  **Perform hand hygiene and don clean gloves and a mask:** Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of infection prevention. Clean gloves provide a barrier against gross contamination during the removal of the old dressing. Masks for both the nurse and the patient minimize the risk of respiratory droplet contamination of the sterile field.\n\n2.  **Remove the old dressing and discard clean gloves:** Removing the old dressing is considered a clean, not sterile, procedure. Discarding the gloves after this step prevents the transfer of microorganisms to the sterile supplies.\n\n3.  **Perform hand hygiene and don sterile gloves:** Transitioning to sterile gloves is essential before manipulating the CVC insertion site. This step ensures that the site is not contaminated during cleansing.\n\n4.  **Cleanse the site with Chlorhexidine (scrubbing back and forth) and let dry:** Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic that reduces the number of microorganisms on the skin. The back-and-forth scrubbing motion provides mechanical friction to dislodge debris and microorganisms. Allowing the chlorhexidine to air dry for the recommended time (usually 30 seconds) is crucial for its effectiveness.\n\n5.  **Apply a sterile transparent semi-permeable dressing:** A sterile transparent dressing allows for continuous visualization of the insertion site for signs of infection (redness, swelling, drainage) without requiring frequent dressing changes. The semi-permeable nature of the dressing allows moisture vapor to escape, preventing moisture buildup under the dressing, which can promote bacterial growth.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing of steps compromises the sterile field and increases the risk of CLABSI. For example, cleansing the site before removing the old dressing would be ineffective as the area is still contaminated. Using a circular 'inner-to-outer' cleaning motion is outdated for chlorhexidine; the recommended method is a 'back-and-forth' scrub.",

            "howToOvercome": "Remember that you only need the client to hold their breath (Valsalva) when *removing* the entire CVC, not during a dressing change. During CVC removal, the Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure, which can help prevent air embolism. During a dressing change, the catheter remains in place, so there is no risk of air entering the bloodstream."
