        "correct": "Following sterile technique is paramount to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). (1) **Positioning (0805):** The dorsal recumbent position provides optimal visualization of the urethral meatus. (2) **Sterile Field (0810):** Opening the sterile kit and donning sterile gloves establishes a sterile field, minimizing the risk of introducing microorganisms. (3) **Cleansing (0815):** Cleansing the perineal area from 'least contaminated to most contaminated' (labia majora, then labia minora, then the meatus) removes bacteria away from the urethral opening. (4) **Insertion (0820):** Inserting the catheter until urine flow is observed confirms entry into the bladder. Advancing an additional 1-2 inches ensures the balloon is positioned within the bladder and not in the urethra. (5) **Inflation (0825):** Inflating the balloon with the correct amount of sterile water anchors the catheter in place.",

The client reports no known allergies to iodine or chlorhexidine and vital signs are stable.\nAssessment: The client is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The perineal area is intact without signs of infection or irritation. Bladder scan indicates 600 mL of urine retained.\nRecommendation: Proceed with indwelling urinary catheter insertion using strict sterile technique as ordered at 0800. Monitor urine output and for signs of infection post-procedure. Document the procedure, including the amount and characteristics of urine obtained, and the client's response to the procedure."
