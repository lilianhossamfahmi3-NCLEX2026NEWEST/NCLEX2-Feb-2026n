    "correct": "The correct order prevents contamination of the Regular insulin with NPH insulin, which could alter its absorption and effectiveness. \n\n(1) Inject air into the NPH vial: This creates positive pressure, facilitating withdrawal of the NPH insulin later.\n(2) Inject air into the Regular vial: Similar to NPH, this creates positive pressure for withdrawal.\n(3) Withdraw the prescribed dose of Regular insulin: Regular insulin is drawn up first to avoid contamination with NPH.\n(4) Withdraw the prescribed dose of NPH insulin: The final step is to withdraw the NPH insulin to the correct dose, being careful not to introduce Regular insulin into the NPH vial.\n\nThis process ensures accurate dosing and prevents alterations in the onset and duration of action of the insulins.",
    "incorrect": "Withdrawing NPH before Regular is a safety error. If NPH gets into the Regular vial, it will change the onset time of the short-acting insulin, potentially leading to unpredictable glycemic control. Injecting air in the wrong order can also lead to inaccurate dosing.",

    "pathophysiology": "Mixing insulins with different onset and duration of action allows for a more tailored approach to glycemic control. Regular insulin provides a rapid bolus to cover mealtime glucose excursions, while NPH provides a longer-acting basal insulin level. Contamination of Regular insulin with NPH can delay its onset and blunt its peak effect, leading to hyperglycemia. Conversely, introducing Regular insulin into the NPH vial can accelerate the onset of the NPH, potentially causing hypoglycemia."
