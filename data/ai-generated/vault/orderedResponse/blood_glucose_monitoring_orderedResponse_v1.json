    "correct": "Performing a POC blood glucose test requires a specific sequence to ensure accurate results and prevent infection. (1) Cleansing the site with alcohol reduces the risk of introducing bacteria into the puncture wound, preventing infection. Allowing the alcohol to dry completely prevents hemolysis of the blood sample. (2) Puncturing the side of the finger pad minimizes discomfort as there are fewer nerve endings in this area. (3) The first drop of blood may be diluted with interstitial fluid, leading to inaccurate glucose readings. Wiping it away ensures a more accurate sample. (4) Applying the second drop to the reagent strip allows for accurate glucose measurement by the glucometer. (5) Applying pressure to the puncture site promotes hemostasis and prevents prolonged bleeding or hematoma formation.",

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Hyperglycemia can lead to various complications, including microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular (cardiovascular disease) complications. Regular monitoring helps to maintain blood glucose levels within the target range, preventing or delaying these complications. The procedure itself minimizes infection risk and ensures a representative sample for accurate measurement.",
