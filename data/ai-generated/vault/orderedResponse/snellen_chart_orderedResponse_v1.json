        "correct": "The correct order ensures standardized and accurate visual acuity testing.\n\n1. **Positioning (o1):** Maintaining a consistent distance of 20 feet is crucial for accurate Snellen chart readings. This distance simulates the optical infinity point, minimizing accommodation and ensuring parallel light rays enter the eye. Deviation from this distance alters the visual angle and invalidates the test.\n\n2. **Eye Covering (o2):** Using an opaque card prevents the client from subconsciously peeking or squinting, which can artificially improve visual acuity. The card should be held firmly against the forehead and nose to ensure complete occlusion without applying pressure to the eye itself.\n\n3. **Binocular Vision (o3):** Assessing vision with both eyes open first provides a baseline of the client's overall visual function. If corrective lenses are normally worn, they should be worn during this initial assessment to determine best-corrected visual acuity.\n\n4. **Monocular Vision (o4):** Testing each eye individually allows for the identification of unilateral visual deficits that may not be apparent during binocular testing. Testing the right eye before the left is a common practice for consistency.\n\n5. **Result Recording (o5):** The standard criterion for determining visual acuity is the smallest line on which the client correctly identifies more than half of the letters. This accounts for minor variations in performance and ensures a reliable measurement of visual acuity.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing will lead to inaccurate or unreliable visual acuity measurements. Failing to maintain the correct distance, allowing peeking, or not testing each eye individually can all compromise the validity of the test.
