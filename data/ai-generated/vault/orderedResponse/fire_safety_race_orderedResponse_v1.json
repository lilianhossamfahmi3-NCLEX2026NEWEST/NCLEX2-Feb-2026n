(R) Rescue: Immediate removal of individuals from the fire area is paramount to prevent injury or death from smoke inhalation, burns, or structural collapse. (A) Activate/Alarm: Initiating the fire alarm system alerts the fire department and other staff, enabling a coordinated response. Notifying the facility operator ensures proper communication and resource allocation. (C) Confine/Contain: Closing doors and windows limits oxygen supply to the fire, slowing its spread and minimizing smoke damage to other areas. (E) Extinguish: Attempting to extinguish the fire is only appropriate if it is small, contained, and the individual has a clear and safe exit route. Using the correct fire extinguisher for the type of fire is crucial to avoid exacerbating the situation.",
