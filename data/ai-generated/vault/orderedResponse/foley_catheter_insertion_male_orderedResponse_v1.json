(1) **Preparation:** Proper positioning and sterile field setup are crucial for maintaining asepsis. (2) **Cleansing:** Cleansing the meatus with antiseptic swabs in a circular motion reduces the risk of introducing bacteria into the urethra. (3) **Lubrication and Insertion:** Adequate lubrication minimizes friction and discomfort during insertion. The male urethra is longer than the female urethra, requiring a longer insertion length. (4) **Advancement to Bifurcation:** In males, advancing the catheter to the bifurcation of the 'Y' port ensures that the catheter balloon is positioned within the bladder and not in the urethra, preventing inflation-related trauma. (5) **Inflation and Confirmation:** Inflating the balloon with the correct amount of sterile water and gently pulling back confirms proper placement within the bladder.",
        "incorrect": "Advancing the catheter only until urine is seen and then inflating the balloon is a common error.
