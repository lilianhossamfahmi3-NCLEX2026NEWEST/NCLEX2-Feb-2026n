            "correct": "1. **Assess the patient's understanding of her discharge instructions and provide written materials in plain language, ensuring comprehension:** This is the highest priority. Without verifying understanding, subsequent interventions may be ineffective. Plain language ensures accessibility, addressing health literacy concerns.\n\n2. **Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and provide a simplified medication schedule, considering her expressed difficulties:** Medication adherence is crucial for managing HF, diabetes, and hypertension. Simplifying the schedule and addressing her expressed difficulties directly supports her ability to adhere to the regimen.\n\n3. **Collaborate with dietary services to provide the patient with a sample low-sodium, diabetic meal plan and resources for affordable healthy food options in her community:** Addressing her dietary needs is essential for managing HF and diabetes. Providing a meal plan and affordable options directly addresses her financial constraints and supports dietary adherence.\n\n4. **Contact the social worker to address financial concerns and explore available resources for medication and food assistance programs:** Addressing financial barriers is a key social determinant of health. Connecting her with resources reduces these barriers, promoting health equity.\n\n5. **Advocate for culturally sensitive home healthcare services, emphasizing the importance of respectful and patient-centered care to the home health agency:** Addressing her previous negative experiences with home healthcare is vital for ensuring she receives the necessary support. Advocating for culturally sensitive care promotes trust and engagement.\n\n6. **Arrange for a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within 7 days to monitor her condition and address any emerging concerns:** Timely follow-up is essential for monitoring her condition and addressing any complications that may arise post-discharge. It provides an opportunity to reinforce education and adjust her treatment plan as needed.",
