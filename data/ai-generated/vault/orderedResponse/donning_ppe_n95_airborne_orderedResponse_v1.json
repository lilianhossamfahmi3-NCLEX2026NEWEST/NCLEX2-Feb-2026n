(5) **Gloves:** Provide a protective barrier for the hands and are donned last to maintain dexterity for other steps.",

Tuberculosis (TB), for example, is caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which is transmitted through airborne droplets. The N95 respirator is specifically designed to filter out these small particles, preventing inhalation and subsequent infection. Proper donning of PPE creates a barrier that protects healthcare workers from exposure to these pathogens, reducing the risk of nosocomial infections."
