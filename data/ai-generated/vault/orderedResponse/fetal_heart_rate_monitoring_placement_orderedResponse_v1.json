    "correct": "External fetal monitoring is a non-invasive method used to assess fetal well-being during labor by tracking the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions.\n\n**(1) Perform Leopold maneuvers:** Leopold maneuvers are a systematic way to palpate the maternal abdomen to determine fetal presentation, position, and lie. This step is crucial for identifying the optimal location for the ultrasound transducer to obtain a clear FHR signal. Knowing the fetal position helps in accurately placing the transducer over the fetal back where the heart sounds are best auscultated.\n\n**(2) Apply conducting gel to the ultrasound (US) transducer:** Applying gel to the transducer ensures good contact between the transducer and the maternal skin. The gel acts as a conductive medium, facilitating the transmission of ultrasound waves and improving the quality of the FHR signal.\n\n**(3) Place the US transducer over the area corresponding to the fetal back:** The ultrasound transducer emits and receives ultrasound waves that bounce off the fetal heart, allowing the monitor to calculate the FHR. Placing the transducer over the fetal back maximizes the signal strength and clarity, providing the most accurate FHR reading. The fetal back is typically located after performing Leopold maneuvers.\n\n**(4) Place the tocotransducer (toco) over the uterine fundus:** The tocotransducer measures uterine contractions. It is placed over the fundus because the fundus is the most muscular part of the uterus and where contractions are most easily detected. The toco measures the frequency and duration of contractions but not their intensity.\n\n**(5) Adjust the belts and verify that the FHR is distinct from the maternal pulse:** After placing both transducers, the belts are adjusted to ensure they are snug but not too tight, allowing for continuous monitoring without causing discomfort. It is essential to differentiate the FHR from the maternal heart rate to avoid misinterpretation of the data. This can be done by palpating the maternal pulse while simultaneously listening to the FHR. A significant difference in rate confirms that the FHR is being accurately monitored.",
    "incorrect": "Placing the ultrasound transducer incorrectly (e.g., near the mother's pubis when the baby is breech) will result in a poor or absent signal, leading to inaccurate monitoring. Failing to differentiate between the maternal and fetal heart rates can lead to incorrect interpretation of the fetal status. Applying the gel directly to the abdomen instead of the transducer will not provide adequate transmission of ultrasound waves.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      "o1 -> Correct: Leopold maneuvers are the first step to determine fetal position for optimal transducer placement.",
      "o2 -> Correct: Gel is needed for ultrasound transmission to ensure a clear signal.",
      "o3 -> Correct: Ultrasound transducer placement follows gel application over the fetal back.",
      "o4 -> Correct: Toco placement on the fundus monitors uterine contractions.",
      "o5 -> Correct: Verification ensures accurate FHR monitoring and differentiation from maternal pulse."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "A normal FHR baseline is 110-160 bpm.",
      "Persistent fetal tachycardia or bradycardia can indicate fetal distress and requires further evaluation.",
