        "correct": "Following strict transfusion protocols is crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening hemolytic reactions.\n\n(1) **Verify the blood product and client identity with another RN:** This dual verification process is the most critical safety check to ensure the correct blood product is administered to the correct client, preventing ABO incompatibility reactions. Mismatched blood can trigger a rapid and severe immune response, leading to hemolysis, shock, and potentially death.\n\n(2) **Obtain baseline vital signs:** Establishing baseline vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) is essential for monitoring the client's response to the transfusion and detecting any adverse reactions. Changes from baseline can indicate a transfusion reaction, such as a febrile non-hemolytic reaction or an allergic reaction.\n\n(3) **Start the infusion at a slow rate (e.g., 2 mL/min):** Initiating the transfusion at a slow rate allows for early detection of any immediate adverse reactions. A slow infusion rate minimizes the volume of blood infused in case of a reaction, reducing the severity of the reaction.\n\n(4) **Stay with the client for the first 15 minutes of the infusion:** The first 15 minutes of the transfusion is the period when life-threatening reactions, such as acute hemolytic reactions or anaphylaxis, are most likely to occur. Close monitoring during this period allows for immediate intervention if a reaction develops.\n\n(5) **Re-check vital signs after 15 minutes:** Rechecking vital signs after 15 minutes confirms the client's stability before increasing the infusion rate. Stable vital signs indicate that the client is tolerating the transfusion well and that it is safe to proceed with a faster infusion rate.",
