    "correct": "Standardizing IV starts reduces failure and infection.\n\n1.  **Apply a tourniquet and identify a suitable vein:** Applying a tourniquet distends the veins, making them more visible and palpable, facilitating successful venipuncture. Proper vein selection minimizes the risk of complications like infiltration or phlebitis.\n\n2.  **Cleanse the site with a chlorhexidine or alcohol swab:** Cleansing the site with an antiseptic solution reduces the risk of introducing microorganisms into the bloodstream, preventing local or systemic infections. Chlorhexidine is generally preferred due to its longer-lasting antimicrobial effect compared to alcohol.\n\n3.  **Perform the venipuncture at a 10-30 degree angle:** A 10-30 degree angle allows for smooth entry into the vein without puncturing through the posterior wall. This reduces the risk of hematoma formation and increases the likelihood of successful catheter insertion.\n\n4.  **Observe for blood return ('flashback'), then advance the catheter:** Observing for blood return in the catheter hub confirms that the catheter has entered the vein lumen. Advancing the catheter after flashback ensures that the entire catheter is within the vein, minimizing the risk of infiltration.\n\n5.  **Release the tourniquet and secure the catheter:** Releasing the tourniquet reduces venous pressure and prevents hematoma formation. Securing the catheter with appropriate dressing and tape stabilizes the catheter and prevents dislodgement.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to release the tourniquet before flushing or securing is a common error that causes site leakage. Premature or delayed advancement of the catheter can lead to vessel damage or infiltration. Inadequate site preparation increases the risk of infection. Incorrect angle of insertion can result in transfixation of the vein.",
    "answerBreakdown": [],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Avoid 'slapping' the vein to dilate it; instead, use gravity, warmth, or a blood pressure cuff. Consider using an IV start kit to ensure all necessary supplies are readily available. Always document the date, time, gauge, location, and number of attempts for each IV insertion."
