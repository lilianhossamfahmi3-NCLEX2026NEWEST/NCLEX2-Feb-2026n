Foley catheter inserted, draining cloudy amber urine.\n\nDay 2, 0100 (1:00 AM): Client increasingly fatigued. Urine output has decreased significantly over the last 8 hours. Provider notified of urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Labs drawn and order received to monitor vital signs every 2 hours.\n\nDay 3, 0730 (7:30 AM): Client appears anxious and reports feeling 'fluttering' in chest. Skin is cool and clammy.

The vital signs trend shows progressive hypotension and tachycardia. The labs confirm severe AKI (Creatinine 3.9, BUN 88) and critical hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8). The ECG showing peaked T waves is a classic sign of hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity, which can lead to fatal arrhythmias. The elevated lactate confirms tissue hypoperfusion. The nurse's first and most crucial action is to prevent further harm. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated because it can worsen hyperkalemia, cause profound hypotension in this hemodynamically unstable client, and exacerbate renal dysfunction. Therefore, the priority is to withhold this medication and immediately communicate the client's critical status to the provider.",

While requesting an order for insulin/dextrose is a necessary and urgent step, it is not the *first* action; the nurse must first independently prevent iatrogenic harm by withholding the contraindicated medication. Administering the antibiotic is important for treating the underlying sepsis, but the immediate threat to life is cardiovascular collapse from hyperkalemia and hypotension, which would be worsened by administering the lisinopril.",
