The new-onset ventricular arrhythmia (multifocal PVCs) in the setting of hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L) poses a significant risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias. The nurse's priority is to prevent further harm and implement life-saving interventions. Lisinopril and furosemide are contraindicated due to the client's hypotension and hypokalemia, respectively. Administering potassium chloride is essential to correct the electrolyte imbalance and stabilize the myocardium. Communicating these critical findings to the provider is crucial for further evaluation and management. Using SBAR, the nurse would communicate the Situation (cardiogenic shock, new arrhythmia), Background (recent STEMI/PCI, current meds), Assessment (hypotension, hypokalemia, PVCs), and Recommendation (hold lisinopril/furosemide, administer KCl, further evaluation).",
    "incorrect": "Administering furosemide would worsen hypokalemia and increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Lisinopril would further decrease blood pressure, exacerbating the shock state. Requesting amiodarone is a collaborative action, and addressing the underlying electrolyte imbalance is the priority. Placing the client in a supine position with legs elevated may increase preload and worsen pulmonary congestion in cardiogenic shock. These actions are either directly harmful, not independently actionable, or not the priority intervention.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, causes vasodilation and lowers blood pressure. In cardiogenic shock with hypotension (86/56 mmHg), administering lisinopril would worsen hypotension and counteract the norepinephrine infusion. Withholding lisinopril is a critical safety measure to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion. The pathophysiology behind this is that ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. In a patient already hypotensive due to cardiogenic shock, this effect is detrimental. Clinical Pearl: Always assess blood pressure before administering ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with heart failure or at risk for hypotension."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes potassium excretion. The client's potassium level is already critically low (3.2 mEq/L), increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Administering furosemide would further deplete potassium, exacerbating myocardial irritability and potentially leading to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The pathophysiology is that furosemide inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of potassium in the urine. This hypokalemia increases the excitability of myocardial cells, predisposing them to arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Always check potassium levels before administering loop diuretics, especially in patients with cardiac conditions or those taking digoxin."

Prompt communication with the provider is essential to facilitate further orders and collaborative management, which may include adjustments to infusions or consideration of antiarrhythmic therapy after potassium correction. The pathophysiology is that hypokalemia alters the resting membrane potential of myocardial cells, making them more susceptible to ectopic firing and arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias can compromise cardiac output and lead to hemodynamic instability. Clinical Pearl: Always report new-onset arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances to the provider immediately, especially in critically ill patients."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. The STAT order for potassium chloride indicates the provider is aware of the hypokalemia. Administering potassium chloride is a priority therapeutic action to correct the electrolyte imbalance and stabilize the client's myocardium. Hypokalemia increases myocardial irritability and the risk of arrhythmias. Correcting the potassium level is crucial for preventing life-threatening dysrhythmias. The pathophysiology is that potassium is essential for maintaining normal cellular function, including myocardial cell excitability and contractility. Hypokalemia disrupts these processes, leading to arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Always administer potassium chloride infusions cautiously and monitor the patient for signs of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves on the ECG."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. While amiodarone may eventually be indicated for ventricular arrhythmias, requesting a specific medication is a prescriptive act outside the nurse's independent scope of practice. The priority is to address the underlying cause (hypokalemia) first, as this may resolve the arrhythmia without the need for antiarrhythmic drugs. The pathophysiology is that amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that prolongs the action potential duration and refractory period in myocardial cells, suppressing arrhythmias. However, it also has potential side effects, such as hypotension and bradycardia. Clinical Pearl: Always address underlying causes of arrhythmias, such as electrolyte imbalances, before initiating antiarrhythmic therapy."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. This position (passive leg raise/modified Trendelenburg) increases preload by returning venous blood to the heart. In cardiogenic shock, the left ventricle is failing and cannot effectively pump blood forward. Acutely increasing preload can worsen pulmonary congestion and respiratory distress without improving cardiac output. The pathophysiology is that cardiogenic shock is characterized by impaired myocardial contractility, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Increasing preload in this situation can overwhelm the failing heart and exacerbate pulmonary edema. Clinical Pearl: Avoid Trendelenburg position in patients with cardiogenic shock or heart failure, as it can worsen pulmonary congestion."
