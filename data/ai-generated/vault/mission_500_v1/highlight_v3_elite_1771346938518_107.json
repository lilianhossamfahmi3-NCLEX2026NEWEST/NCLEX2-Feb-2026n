The critical findings include hypotension (BP 88/56), signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (new confusion, cool/mottled extremities, oliguria), and metabolic evidence of tissue hypoxia (elevated lactate of 4.2 mmol/L). Additionally, the low potassium (3.4 mEq/L) increases the risk of arrhythmias, further compromising cardiac function. Administering carvedilol, a beta-blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock as it can worsen cardiac output and lead to cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must withhold carvedilol and urgently inform the provider about the client's deteriorating condition.",
