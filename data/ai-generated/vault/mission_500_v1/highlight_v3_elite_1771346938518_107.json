Key indicators include profound hypotension (BP 88/56), signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (new confusion, cool/mottled extremities, oliguria), and metabolic evidence of tissue hypoxia (elevated lactate of 4.2 mmol/L). Administering carvedilol, a beta-blocker with negative inotropic (decreases contractility) and chronotropic (decreases heart rate) effects, to a client in cardiogenic shock is an absolute contraindication. It would further depress cardiac output, leading to cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's primary safety action is to withhold this medication and urgently communicate the client's decompensation to the provider.",
