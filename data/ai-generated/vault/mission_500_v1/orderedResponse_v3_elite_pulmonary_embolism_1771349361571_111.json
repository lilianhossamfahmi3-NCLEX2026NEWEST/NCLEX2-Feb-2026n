States he completed a 14-hour drive yesterday. Reports an overwhelming sense of impending doom and is visibly anxious and restless. Skin is cool, pale, and diaphoretic. He has a history of chronic alcohol use disorder but reports being abstinent for the past 2 months. Denies any recent surgeries. When asked about recent trauma, he mentions he 'took a nasty fall' about one week ago, hitting his head on the pavement but did not lose consciousness or seek medical care as he 'felt okay'."
