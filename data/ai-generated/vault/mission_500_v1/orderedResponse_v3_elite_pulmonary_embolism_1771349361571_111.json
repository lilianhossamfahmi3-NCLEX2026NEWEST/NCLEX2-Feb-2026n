Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/mm³) is an absolute contraindication for administering thrombolytic therapy (Alteplase) and anticoagulation (Heparin) due to the extremely high risk of life-threatening intracerebral or systemic hemorrhage. Alteplase activates plasminogen to form plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. In the presence of thrombocytopenia, the body's natural clotting mechanisms are already compromised, and further inhibiting clot formation can lead to uncontrolled bleeding. Heparin inhibits thrombin and other clotting factors, further increasing the risk of hemorrhage. The nurse's primary responsibility is to recognize this safety risk and prevent a potentially fatal medication error. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment in clinical practice.",

The provider needs this information to urgently re-evaluate and change the treatment plan. The provider needs to consider alternative treatments such as embolectomy or IVC filter placement. This step is crucial for collaborative care and patient safety, allowing for alternative interventions to be considered. The low platelet count could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to the massive PE, or other underlying conditions. Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology.",

The vital signs show worsening tachypnea and an SpO2 of 88% despite a 15L non-rebreather mask, indicating impending respiratory failure. The massive PE is causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxemia and increased work of breathing. The right ventricular strain further compromises cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Escalating respiratory support is a critical life-sustaining intervention that must be performed to prevent respiratory arrest. This may involve increasing oxygen delivery via high-flow nasal cannula or preparing for intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

Establishing a second large-bore IV is essential for administering fluids, vasopressors, or potential blood products (including platelets) needed to manage obstructive shock. The massive PE can lead to obstructive shock due to the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, which impairs right ventricular function and reduces cardiac output. This action supports hemodynamic stability but is a lower priority than preventing hemorrhage and managing respiratory failure.",

Administering Alteplase to a client with a platelet count of 45,000/mm³ could induce catastrophic bleeding, particularly given the client's recent head trauma. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that dissolves blood clots by activating plasminogen. In a patient with severe thrombocytopenia, the risk of bleeding is significantly increased because the body lacks the necessary platelets to form clots and stop bleeding. This choice demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical contraindication and would likely result in significant patient harm or death. The recent fall with head trauma further increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.",

While the client is anxious, administering morphine, a CNS and respiratory depressant, to a client who is already hypotensive (BP 94/58) and in respiratory distress (RR 36, SpO2 88% on NRB) is contraindicated. Morphine can further depress the respiratory drive and worsen hypoxemia and hypotension. The priority is to address the physiological instability, not sedate the client. The anxiety is likely a result of the hypoxia and feeling of impending doom associated with the PE.",
