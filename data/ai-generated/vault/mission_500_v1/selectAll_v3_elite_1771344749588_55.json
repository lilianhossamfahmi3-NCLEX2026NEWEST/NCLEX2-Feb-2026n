Daughter reports the client delayed seeking care for about an hour because they were 'worried about the cost of the ambulance.' During history intake, the daughter also mentions, 'He had that major back surgery recently... I think it was a couple of weeks ago, but I'm not exactly sure of the date.'"

The nurse's role is to be the final safety check before administration. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication because platelets are essential for forming a primary hemostatic plug; without them, the thrombolytic agent can cause uncontrollable bleeding. Major surgery within the last 14 days is also an absolute contraindication due to the risk of hemorrhage at the surgical site. The daughter's uncertain timeline ('a couple of weeks ago') necessitates an immediate stop to clarify the exact date before proceeding. Both findings represent an unacceptable risk of harm, mandating that the nurse withhold the drug and immediately communicate these critical findings to the provider.",

While hyperglycemia should be managed (an order for sliding scale insulin is present), a glucose level of 198 mg/dL is not an absolute contraindication for alteplase.
