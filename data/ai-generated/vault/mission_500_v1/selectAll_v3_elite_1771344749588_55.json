    "correct": "The primary safety principle when administering alteplase is to rigorously screen for contraindications that increase the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. The nurse's role is to be the final safety check before administration.\n\nA platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication because platelets are essential for forming a primary hemostatic plug; without them, the thrombolytic agent can cause uncontrollable bleeding. In this case, the client's platelet count of 75,000/mm³ indicates severe thrombocytopenia. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In the absence of sufficient platelets, the body's ability to form clots is severely compromised, leading to an increased risk of hemorrhage.\n\nMajor surgery within the last 14 days is also an absolute contraindication due to the risk of hemorrhage at the surgical site. The daughter's uncertain timeline ('a couple of weeks ago') necessitates an immediate stop to clarify the exact date before proceeding. Recent surgical sites are vulnerable due to disrupted tissue integrity and ongoing healing processes. Alteplase's thrombolytic action can interfere with clot formation at these sites, leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications.",

        "justification": "This is incorrect. The guideline for alteplase administration requires blood pressure to be lowered and maintained at or below 185/110 mmHg. This reading is within the acceptable threshold. Therefore, it is a reason to proceed, not to stop. Labetalol was administered at 1015 to lower the BP. Elevated BP is common in acute stroke due to the body's compensatory mechanisms to maintain cerebral perfusion. However, excessively high BP increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion after alteplase administration."

A result showing 'no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage' is a prerequisite for administering alteplase in an ischemic stroke. This finding confirms the indication for treatment. Hemorrhagic stroke must be ruled out because alteplase would exacerbate bleeding in such cases. The CT scan differentiates between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, guiding appropriate treatment."

        "justification": "This is incorrect. While hyperglycemia should be managed (an order for sliding scale insulin is present), a glucose level of 198 mg/dL is not an absolute contraindication for alteplase. Treatment should not be delayed to normalize glucose unless it is extremely high (>400 mg/dL) or low (<50 mg/dL). Hyperglycemia can worsen ischemic brain injury by increasing lactic acid production and exacerbating neuronal damage. However, it is managed concurrently with alteplase administration."

        "justification": "This is correct. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration. Platelets are critical for hemostasis. Administering a potent thrombolytic in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia creates an extremely high risk of spontaneous and uncontrollable intracranial or systemic hemorrhage. This is a critical safety stop. Platelets aggregate at the site of vascular injury to form a primary hemostatic plug. Thrombocytopenia impairs this process, making the client highly vulnerable to bleeding complications, especially with the use of alteplase."

This high score is a strong indication for thrombolytic therapy to potentially reverse the neurological deficit and improve long-term outcomes. It is a reason to proceed with urgency, not to withhold treatment. The NIHSS quantifies the severity of neurological deficits, guiding treatment decisions and predicting prognosis. A higher score indicates more severe impairment and a greater potential benefit from thrombolysis."

        "justification": "This is correct. Major surgery within the preceding 14 days is an absolute contraindication to alteplase due to the high risk of severe bleeding from the recent surgical site. The daughter's vague timeline ('a couple of weeks ago') creates a critical ambiguity. The nurse cannot proceed safely without definitively confirming the date of the surgery. This uncertainty requires an immediate stop and clarification with the provider. Surgical procedures disrupt tissue integrity and involve vascular manipulation, creating a risk of bleeding. Alteplase can interfere with the healing process and cause hemorrhage at the surgical site. The 14-day window is based on the typical timeframe for initial wound healing and clot stabilization."
