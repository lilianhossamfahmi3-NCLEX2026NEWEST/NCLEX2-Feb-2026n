The client's platelet count is 72,000/mm³, which is well below the minimum threshold of 100,000/mm³ required for safe administration of thrombolytics. This severe thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to the client's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and resulting hypersplenism, places the client at an extremely high risk for catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage if alteplase is given. In alcoholic cirrhosis, liver damage leads to decreased production of thrombopoietin, a hormone that stimulates platelet production. Additionally, portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis causes splenomegaly, leading to increased sequestration and destruction of platelets in the spleen. The nurse must act as the final safety barrier, withhold the medication, and communicate this critical finding to the provider immediately.",

While the client's blood pressure of 194/112 mmHg is above the required threshold of <185/110 mmHg for tPA administration, treating the hypertension is futile and dangerous because the client has an absolute contraindication (platelet count <100,000/mm³) that makes them ineligible for the therapy altogether. Prioritizing BP management in this context shows a failure to recognize the more critical, overriding safety issue."

        "justification": "This is a life-threatening action. Administering a thrombolytic agent to a client with a platelet count of 72,000/mm³ creates a profound risk of uncontrolled bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which could be fatal. Alteplase works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In the presence of thrombocytopenia, the body's natural clotting mechanisms are already compromised. Introducing alteplase further disrupts hemostasis, significantly increasing the risk of bleeding. Despite the client being within the therapeutic time window and having a negative head CT for hemorrhage, the severe thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication that must be identified and respected."

The nurse has correctly synthesized all available data (history, labs, vitals) to identify a critical, absolute contraindication to the prescribed therapy. The platelet count of 72,000/mm³ is a 'safety stop' point. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent patient harm by withholding the medication and escalating the concern to the prescribing provider (stroke team) for a re-evaluation of the treatment plan."
