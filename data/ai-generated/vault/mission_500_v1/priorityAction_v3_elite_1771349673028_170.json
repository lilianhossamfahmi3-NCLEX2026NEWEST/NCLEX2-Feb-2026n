The client's platelet count is 72,000/mm³, which is well below the minimum threshold of 100,000/mm³ required for safe administration of thrombolytics. This severe thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to the client's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and resulting hypersplenism, places the client at an extremely high risk for catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage if alteplase is given. The nurse must act as the final safety barrier, withhold the medication, and communicate this critical finding to the provider immediately.",

While the client's blood pressure of 194/112 mmHg is above the required threshold of <185/110 mmHg for tPA administration, treating the hypertension is futile and dangerous because the client has an absolute contraindication (platelet count <100,000/mm³) that makes them ineligible for the therapy altogether.
