The client has life-threatening hyperkalemia with ECG changes, which requires cardiac membrane stabilization, typically with IV calcium. However, the client is taking digoxin and has a level at the high end of the therapeutic range (1.9 ng/mL). Rapid administration of IV calcium can potentiate the effects of digoxin, leading to hypercalcemia-induced digoxin toxicity and potentially fatal arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or asystole ('stone heart'). The nurse must recognize this severe contraindication and immediately contact the provider to clarify the order, suggest a slower infusion rate, or discuss alternative strategies before administering a potentially lethal medication."

                "justification": "This is the second most critical action. The client's initial ECG already shows significant cardiotoxicity from hyperkalemia (bradycardia, widened QRS). Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to immediately detect any worsening of the arrhythmia or the client's response to treatment. This action must be implemented before any medications are administered to ensure client safety."

                "justification": "After addressing the immediate safety concern with the calcium order and ensuring the client is monitored, the next priority is to rapidly lower the serum potassium level. The combination of IV regular insulin and D50W is the fastest-acting intervention to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells. This directly mitigates the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia."

                "justification": "Administering a high-dose beta-2 agonist like albuterol also helps shift potassium into the cells. It is an effective adjunctive therapy to insulin and dextrose but generally has a slightly slower onset of action. It can be administered concurrently with or immediately following the insulin/dextrose bolus to provide an additional potassium-lowering effect."

                "justification": "While emergent hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for removing potassium from the body, it is not the most immediate action the nurse can take. The preceding steps (stabilizing the cardiac membrane safely, shifting potassium intracellularly) are temporizing measures to prevent cardiac arrest while arrangements for dialysis are made. Initiating the consult is a crucial step, but it follows the immediate life-saving interventions."
