The client presents with severe hyperkalemia (K+ 7.2 mEq/L) and ECG changes (tall, peaked T-waves, prolonged PR, widened QRS) indicating cardiotoxicity. While calcium gluconate can stabilize the cardiac membrane in hyperkalemia, this client is also taking digoxin, with a level of 1.9 ng/mL, near the upper therapeutic limit. Administering calcium to a patient on digoxin can lead to 'stone heart' syndrome, causing severe bradycardia, asystole, or other life-threatening arrhythmias due to increased intracellular calcium. The nurse must immediately clarify the order with the provider, suggesting alternative treatments like sodium bicarbonate or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) if appropriate. This action prevents potential iatrogenic harm.",

        "justification": "Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial due to the client's hyperkalemia-induced ECG changes and bradycardia (48 bpm). Hyperkalemia disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart by affecting the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells. Elevated extracellular potassium reduces the concentration gradient for potassium efflux, leading to a less negative resting membrane potential. This can cause slowed conduction, arrhythmias, and ultimately cardiac arrest. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection of any worsening arrhythmias or response to treatment, enabling timely intervention.",

        "justification": "Administering insulin and dextrose is a key intervention to rapidly lower serum potassium levels. Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in cells, promoting the uptake of potassium into cells along with glucose. Dextrose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, which could be induced by the insulin. This temporarily shifts potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, mitigating the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia. This is a temporizing measure while awaiting definitive treatment.",

It stimulates the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, similar to insulin, but its effect is primarily mediated through beta-2 receptors. While helpful, it's not as potent or rapid-acting as insulin/dextrose and is considered an adjunctive therapy.",

Hemodialysis removes excess potassium directly from the bloodstream, correcting the electrolyte imbalance. However, it is a more time-consuming process than the other interventions and requires specialized equipment and personnel. Therefore, it is facilitated after the immediate life-threatening issues are addressed.",

    "situation": "1500: A 78-year-old male with a history of heart failure, chronic kidney disease (Stage 3), and hypertension presented to the ED with progressive weakness, nausea, and palpitations over the last 24 hours. He is lethargic and oriented to person only. HR is 48 bpm, BP is 102/64, RR is 16, and SpO2 is 95%. ECG shows sinus bradycardia with prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and tall, peaked T-waves.",
    "background": "The patient has a history of heart failure, CKD, and hypertension. He admits to 'stretching' his furosemide and using a salt substitute. Medications include digoxin, furosemide, and lisinopril. Labs show K+ 7.2 mEq/L, BUN 45 mg/dL, creatinine 2.8 mg/dL, and digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL.",
    "assessment": "The patient is experiencing severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes indicative of cardiotoxicity. His digoxin level is at the high end of the therapeutic range, increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity if calcium gluconate is administered. He requires immediate intervention to stabilize his cardiac function and lower his potassium level.",
    "recommendation": "I recommend holding the calcium gluconate order due to the risk of digoxin toxicity and discussing alternative treatments with the provider. I also recommend immediate continuous cardiac monitoring, administration of insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly, and facilitating a nephrology consult for emergent hemodialysis. A STAT 12-lead ECG was also ordered but has not yet been performed."
