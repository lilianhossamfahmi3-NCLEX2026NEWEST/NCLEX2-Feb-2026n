The vital signs trend shows a widening pulse pressure (188/75 = pulse pressure of 113), profound bradycardia (54/min), and irregular respirations (12/min, irregular). This constellation of findings is Cushing's Triad, a late and ominous sign of severely increased intracranial pressure (IICP) and impending brain herniation. The 0.45% Sodium Chloride is a hypotonic solution. Administering a hypotonic fluid to a client with IICP is a critical error as it lowers serum osmolality, causing fluid to shift from the intravascular space into the brain cells, which exacerbates cerebral edema and dangerously increases ICP. The immediate priority is to stop this harmful infusion (an independent nursing action) and immediately notify the provider and/or activate the rapid response team to intervene before herniation occurs.",
        "incorrect": "The other actions are incorrect because they either fail to address the life-threatening root cause or are not the most immediate priority. Delaying action to reassess or simply documenting could be fatal. Administering acetaminophen is inappropriate for a non-responsive client and does not address the IICP. While raising the head of the bed is a correct intervention for IICP, it is secondary to stopping the iatrogenic harm caused by the hypotonic IV fluid.",

Administering an oral medication to a client with a decreased LOC poses an aspiration risk. More importantly, this action fails to address the life-threatening Cushing's Triad."

While elevating the head of the bed (typically to 30 degrees, not 45, to promote venous drainage without compromising cerebral perfusion pressure) is a standard intervention for IICP, it is not the *immediate priority*. The priority is to stop the ongoing administration of a fluid that is actively worsening the cerebral edema."

The nurse must also recognize that the infusing 0.45% NaCl is a hypotonic solution, which is contraindicated as it will worsen cerebral edema and accelerate herniation. Stopping the infusion is the critical independent nursing action to prevent further harm. Immediate notification of the provider is the necessary next step for emergency intervention (e.g., surgical decompression, further osmotic therapy)."
