    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening complication of mechanical ventilation with high PEEP in ARDS. The increased intrathoracic pressure from the pneumothorax causes compression of the heart and great vessels, leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output, resulting in obstructive shock. The mediastinal shift further compromises the unaffected lung. The nurse's immediate priorities are to recognize this critical event, notify the interprofessional team for immediate intervention (needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion), and prepare for the life-saving procedure.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either directly harmful, delay life-saving care, or address a lower-priority problem. Increasing PEEP would be lethal as it would worsen the tension pneumothorax and accelerate cardiovascular collapse. Administering furosemide is contraindicated in a hypotensive client and is irrelevant to the acute crisis. Decreasing FiO2 is inappropriate for a profoundly hypoxic patient. While a chest x-ray is needed for confirmation, it should not delay notification of the team and preparation for intervention, as the diagnosis can be made clinically in this emergency.",

Increasing PEEP will further increase intrathoracic pressure, worsening the mediastinal shift and compression of the vena cava and heart, thereby reducing venous return and cardiac output. This will precipitate immediate cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must recognize that the new order is now lethally contraindicated by the client's change in status."
