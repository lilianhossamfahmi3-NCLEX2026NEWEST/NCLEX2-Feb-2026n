    "correctRationale": "The client's platelet count of 92,000/mm³ is below the acceptable threshold of 100,000/mm³ for Alteplase administration. Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, increases the risk of bleeding. Thrombocytopenia further elevates this risk, potentially leading to life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The nurse must immediately notify the provider to withhold the Alteplase. This action aligns with the nurse's role as a patient advocate and ensures patient safety by preventing a potentially catastrophic adverse event. ClinicalPearl: Always verify platelet count before administering thrombolytics.",
    "distractorRationale": {
      "opt_01": "While the client's blood pressure (188/104 mmHg) is elevated and should be addressed, it is not the immediate priority. The blood pressure needs to be <185/110 mmHg prior to tPA administration. However, administering more Labetalol without addressing the contraindication of thrombocytopenia is unsafe. ClinicalPearl: Manage BP before tPA, but always check contraindications first.",
      "opt_03": "Administering Alteplase with a platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is a critical error and could result in severe, potentially fatal, intracranial hemorrhage. This choice demonstrates a lack of understanding of Alteplase contraindications and poses a significant risk to the client. ClinicalPearl: Never administer tPA if platelets are <100,000/mm3.",
      "opt_04": "An elevated Troponin I level (0.09 ng/mL) may indicate cardiac involvement (stroke-heart syndrome) or other cardiac issues. While monitoring is warranted, it is not the immediate priority in the context of acute stroke management and the absolute contraindication to Alteplase. ClinicalPearl: Elevated troponin is common post-stroke, but thrombocytopenia is the priority."
