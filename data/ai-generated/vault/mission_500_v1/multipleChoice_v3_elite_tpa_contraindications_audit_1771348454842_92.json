        "correctRationale": "The priority action is to recognize an absolute contraindication to Alteplase administration and immediately communicate this critical safety finding. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication because it significantly increases the risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The client's platelet count is 92,000/mm³. The nurse has a duty to act as a final safety check and must stop the process ('don't proceed') by notifying the provider of this critical lab value and advocating for the medication to be withheld.",
        "distractorRationale": {
            "opt_01": "While the blood pressure of 188/104 mmHg is still above the target of <185/110 mmHg required for Alteplase administration, this is a relative and often treatable contraindication. Addressing the blood pressure without first recognizing the absolute contraindication of thrombocytopenia is incorrect and unsafe. Lowering the BP would be a prelude to administration, which is contraindicated for another, more critical reason.",
            "opt_03": "This action is extremely dangerous and demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical contraindication. Administering Alteplase to a client with a platelet count below 100,000/mm³ could lead to a catastrophic hemorrhagic event, including fatal intracranial bleeding. This choice represents a critical safety error.",
            "opt_04": "The Troponin I level of 0.09 ng/mL is mildly elevated, which can occur in the setting of acute stroke (stroke-heart syndrome). While this finding warrants monitoring, it is not an absolute contraindication to Alteplase and is not the immediate life-threatening priority. The acute neurological deficit and the risk of hemorrhage from tPA administration are the most urgent concerns."
