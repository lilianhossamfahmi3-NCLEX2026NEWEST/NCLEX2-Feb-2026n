The most critical, immediately life-threatening manifestation of this electrolyte imbalance is its effect on cardiac electrical conduction, demonstrated by the peaked T-waves and widened QRS complex on the ECG. These are pre-arrest signs indicating cardiac membrane instability. The priority action is to prevent further harm and escalate care. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is absolutely contraindicated as it can worsen renal function and, more importantly, cause further potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. Therefore, the nurse must recognize the 'DON'T PROCEED' signal, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider of the critical lab and ECG findings to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., IV calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate).",

While the client is hypotensive and oliguric, fluid administration requires careful consideration in AKI and is not the priority over managing impending cardiac arrest.
