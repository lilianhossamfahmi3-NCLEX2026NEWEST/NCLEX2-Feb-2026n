The nurse has just completed a reassessment. Based on the new findings, what condition is the client most likely experiencing, what two actions should the nurse take, and what two parameters should the nurse monitor?",

Admitted from triage with blood pressure 178/112 mmHg, 3+ proteinuria, severe epigastric pain, headache, and visual disturbances. Magnesium sulfate IV loading dose administered per protocol, now infusing at 2 g/hr. Labetalol 20 mg IV push administered. Client reports pain is 5/10. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are 3+ with 1 beat of clonus. Fetal heart rate (FHR) is 140s with moderate variability.\n\n<b>1800:</b> Client suddenly cried out while being repositioned. States, 'A sudden, sharp pain! It's in my side and goes all the way up to my shoulder!' Client is now pale, diaphoretic, and extremely anxious. Pain is rated 10/10, described as 'tearing' in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and radiating to the right scapula. Appears restless and disoriented to time."

            "pc1": "Incorrect. While the client is at high risk for an eclamptic seizure, the current presentation of sudden, severe RUQ pain with shoulder radiation, hypotension, and tachycardia does not align with the typical signs of an imminent seizure (e.g., severe headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, tonic-clonic activity).",
            "pc2": "Correct. The client's diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, combined with the sudden onset of 10/10 RUQ pain radiating to the scapula (Kehr's sign from diaphragmatic irritation), and the rapid decompensation into a shock state (BP 88/50, HR 134) are classic signs of a subcapsular hematoma of the liver that has ruptured or is actively bleeding.",
            "pc3": "Incorrect. Placental abruption typically presents with vaginal bleeding (which may be concealed), uterine tenderness or rigidity, and fetal distress. The client's primary symptom is severe RUQ pain, not uterine pain.",
            "pc4": "Incorrect. A pulmonary embolism would present with acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxia. While the client is tachypneic and slightly hypoxic, the hallmark feature is the specific location and nature of the pain, which strongly points to a hepatic origin.",
            "pc5": "Incorrect. Magnesium sulfate toxicity presents with respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and lethargy. The client is tachypneic (RR 28) and tachycardic, and DTRs were previously brisk. These findings are opposite of what is expected with magnesium toxicity."
        },
        "actionsToTake": {
            "a1": "Incorrect. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action. The client's blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg. Administering a potent antihypertensive like Labetalol would be catastrophic, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death.",
            "a2": "Correct. The client is in hypovolemic shock from a suspected internal hemorrhage. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate, coordinated intervention from a multidisciplinary team. Activating the rapid response team is the highest priority.",
            "a3": "Incorrect. Increasing the magnesium sulfate infusion is indicated for seizure prophylaxis, not for treating hemorrhagic shock. The current clinical priority is hemodynamic stabilization, not seizure prevention.",
            "a4": "Correct. The client's signs of shock (hypotension, tachycardia) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelets 45,000) indicate a massive internal bleed. The nurse must anticipate the need for emergent replacement of blood products (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) by preparing for the massive transfusion protocol.",
            "a5": "Incorrect. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action. Deep abdominal palpation, such as performing Leopold's maneuvers, is absolutely contraindicated. It could worsen the bleeding from the liver or cause a contained subcapsular hematoma to rupture completely."
        },
        "parametersToMonitor": {
            "p1": "Incorrect. While monitoring DTRs is important for magnesium therapy, it is not the priority parameter for tracking the progression of hemorrhagic shock and organ perfusion. The immediate life threat is circulatory collapse.",
            "p2": "Incorrect. Fetal status is important, but in a maternal life-threatening hemorrhage, the priority shifts to maternal stabilization. The fetal distress is a consequence of maternal shock; therefore, monitoring maternal perfusion parameters is the primary focus.",
            "p3": "Correct. Serial measurement of abdominal circumference is a critical, non-invasive way to monitor for expanding intra-abdominal hemorrhage (hemoperitoneum) from a hepatic rupture. A rapid increase indicates ongoing, uncontrolled bleeding.",
            "p4": "Correct. Urine output is a primary indicator of visceral organ perfusion. In a shock state, decreasing or absent urine output (oliguria/anuria) is one of the earliest signs of inadequate circulation and impending multi-organ system failure.",
            "p5": "Incorrect. While pain is a significant symptom, monitoring the client's objective hemodynamic and perfusion status (urine output, abdominal girth, level of consciousness) is more critical for evaluating the response to resuscitation efforts than repeatedly asking for a subjective pain rating."
