Client states he traveled 3 hours from his rural home for this appointment and is anxious to 'get this over with.' This is his second ever dose of infliximab. He reports no adverse effects after the first dose 4 weeks ago. Baseline assessment is unremarkable. IV access established with 20-gauge catheter in the left forearm. Infliximab infusion initiated as ordered.\n\nDay 1, 10:25: Client uses the call light. States, 'My whole body is starting to itch, and I feel like there's a lump in my throat.' Visible urticaria noted on neck and chest. Client appears anxious and is breathing rapidly. Skin is flushed and warm to the touch."
