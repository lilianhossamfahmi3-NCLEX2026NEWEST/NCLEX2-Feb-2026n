Client states he traveled 3 hours from his rural home for this appointment and is anxious to 'get this over with.' This is his second ever dose of infliximab. He reports no adverse effects after the first dose 4 weeks ago. Baseline assessment is unremarkable. IV access established with 20-gauge catheter in the left forearm. Infliximab infusion initiated as ordered.\n\nDay 1, 1025: Client uses the call light. States, 'My whole body is starting to itch, and I feel like there's a lump in my throat.' Visible urticaria noted on neck and chest. Client appears anxious and is breathing rapidly. Skin is flushed and warm to the touch."

Epinephrine addresses the symptoms, while stopping the infusion addresses the cause.  Epinephrine works by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure, beta-1 adrenergic receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causing bronchodilation to improve breathing. However, ongoing antigen exposure will overwhelm these effects.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Epinephrine is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis, but it's most effective when the antigen source is removed. Remember ABCs: Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Stopping the infusion protects the airway by preventing further swelling."

However, it's less effective if the antigen continues to be administered. Stopping the infusion is the priority to prevent further fluid shifts and vasodilation. Anaphylaxis causes distributive shock, leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output. Fluid boluses help to increase preload and improve cardiac output, but this is secondary to stopping the antigen.",

Delaying treatment to notify the provider can worsen the client's condition.  Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.  The nurse's primary responsibility is patient safety, which includes independent action to stop a harmful medication.",

The RRT can assist with further interventions after the infusion is stopped. The RRT brings additional expertise and support, but the initial action to stop the infusion is within the nurse's scope of practice and is the highest priority.",

Stopping the infusion prevents further antigen exposure and worsening of the reaction. Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction where IgE antibodies bind to mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposure to the antigen triggers degranulation, releasing histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators that cause vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and increased capillary permeability. Stopping the infusion halts this process.",

Stopping the infusion is the priority to prevent further respiratory compromise. Anaphylaxis can cause bronchospasm and airway edema, leading to decreased oxygen saturation. While oxygen is important, it's a supportive measure, not the primary intervention.  High-flow oxygen helps to maximize oxygen delivery to the tissues, but it won't reverse the underlying anaphylactic process.",
