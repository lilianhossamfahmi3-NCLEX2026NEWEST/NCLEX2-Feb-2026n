        "correct": "The combination of severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and its cardiotoxic effects (tall, peaked T-waves on ECG) represents a life-threatening emergency. Adrenal crisis is characterized by aldosterone deficiency, which causes the kidneys to retain potassium. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and an aldosterone antagonist. Administering this medication would block any remaining aldosterone effect and further increase the serum potassium level, potentially precipitating ventricular fibrillation or asystole. This order is absolutely contraindicated and represents a critical safety risk. The nurse must withhold this medication, notify the provider immediately, and prepare for emergent treatment of hyperkalemia.",
        "incorrect": "The other orders are appropriate and indicated for the treatment of adrenal crisis. The client is hypotensive, hypovolemic, hyponatremic, and hypoglycemic. D5NS provides volume, sodium, and glucose to correct these imbalances. Hydrocortisone is the definitive treatment, replacing the deficient glucocorticoid and providing some mineralocorticoid effect. Ondansetron is appropriate for symptomatic treatment of nausea.",
