  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client is experiencing adrenal crisis, a life-threatening condition resulting from insufficient cortisol and aldosterone. The elevated potassium level (6.8 mEq/L) with ECG changes (tall, peaked T-waves) indicates hyperkalemia, a common complication due to aldosterone deficiency. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion by the kidneys. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist. Administering spironolactone would further inhibit aldosterone's already deficient action, leading to increased potassium retention and potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Therefore, this medication is absolutely contraindicated and must be withheld. The nurse must immediately notify the provider to discuss alternative treatments for fluid management and address the hyperkalemia. Treatment for hyperkalemia may include calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), or dialysis in severe cases.",
    "incorrect": "The other medications are appropriate for managing adrenal crisis. D5NS addresses the client's hypotension, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia by providing fluid volume, sodium, and glucose. Hydrocortisone is essential for replacing the deficient cortisol, which helps restore blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and glucose levels. Ondansetron is used to manage nausea and vomiting, common symptoms of adrenal crisis, preventing further fluid and electrolyte loss.",
