The nurse must prioritize actions that restore glucocorticoid levels, correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and stabilize the myocardium.",

The client already has severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 7.1 mEq/L) with ECG changes. Administering this medication would block aldosterone's effect of excreting potassium, further increasing serum potassium and likely precipitating a fatal cardiac arrhythmia."

                "justification": "This is a critical, immediate intervention to treat severe hyperkalemia. IV insulin temporarily shifts potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space, rapidly lowering serum potassium levels and stabilizing the myocardial membrane. It is typically administered with dextrose (like the D5NS infusion) to prevent hypoglycemia."

Attempting to sit or stand the client for orthostatic measurements poses a significant risk of syncope, falls, and further cardiovascular decompensation. The presence of profound hypotension already confirms hemodynamic instability."

The priority is to implement rapid medical interventions (IV fluids, steroids, insulin/dextrose) to stabilize the client. If these measures fail, then hemodialysis would be considered."
