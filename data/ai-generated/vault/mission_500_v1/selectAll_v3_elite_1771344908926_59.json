    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. The vital signs trend shows progressive hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) and respiratory distress, indicative of obstructive shock. The chest x-ray confirms a mediastinal shift. In a tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This pressure compresses the heart and great vessels, reducing venous return and cardiac output, resulting in obstructive shock. The mediastinal shift further compromises ventilation and perfusion. The nurse's immediate priorities are to recognize this emergency, call for help, perform rapid assessments to confirm the diagnosis, troubleshoot potential equipment causes, and prepare for life-saving intervention. These actions address the 'killer' condition of obstructive shock and severe hypoxia.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either dangerous, delay life-saving care, or are not the immediate priority. Administering morphine would be catastrophic, causing respiratory depression and worsening hypotension. Requesting an ABG, while useful for data, wastes critical time when a clinical and radiological diagnosis is already evident and immediate mechanical intervention is required.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action. The client's anxiety is due to severe hypoxia and air hunger, not a primary anxiety disorder. Morphine is an opioid that causes respiratory depression and vasodilation, which would catastrophically worsen the client's already severe respiratory distress, hypoxia, and profound hypotension (obstructive shock). Opioids depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, reducing respiratory rate and tidal volume. Vasodilation further decreases blood pressure, exacerbating the obstructive shock. This action could precipitate respiratory and cardiac arrest."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a critical first step. A tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention beyond the scope of independent nursing practice (e.g., needle decompression, chest tube insertion). Activating the RRT and notifying the provider ensures that a team with advanced skills and equipment arrives promptly to perform life-saving procedures. The RRT can provide advanced airway management, administer medications, and assist with the decompression procedure. Prompt notification ensures timely intervention and improves patient outcomes."

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Prepare for immediate needle decompression.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This action demonstrates anticipation of the required life-saving intervention. The nurse should gather the necessary equipment (large-bore needle, antiseptic) and prepare the client's chest (anterior 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line) so the provider or RRT can perform the procedure without delay. Needle decompression converts the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax by allowing trapped air to escape. This reduces intrathoracic pressure, improving venous return and cardiac output. This proactive step saves critical time."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the most immediate independent troubleshooting action. A tension pneumothorax can develop if an existing chest tube becomes occluded (e.g., by a kink in the tubing or an inadvertent clamp), preventing air from escaping the pleural space. Rapidly assessing and resolving any obstruction could potentially relieve the tension and is a primary nursing responsibility. Obstruction of the chest tube prevents the drainage of air and fluid from the pleural space, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure and the development of a tension pneumothorax."

        "content": "Request a STAT arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This action delays definitive treatment. While the ABG would undoubtedly confirm severe hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis, the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax is already clear from the overwhelming clinical evidence (vital signs, physical assessment) and the definitive x-ray findings. Waiting for a lab result before taking action is inappropriate and could be fatal. The priority is mechanical decompression, not further diagnostics. The ABG results would reflect the impaired gas exchange, but obtaining them delays the necessary intervention to relieve the pressure on the heart and lungs."

        "label": "F",
        "content": "Assess for tracheal deviation and jugular vein distention (JVD).",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a priority physical assessment to confirm the clinical diagnosis at the bedside. The increased intrathoracic pressure from the trapped air pushes the mediastinum, including the trachea, to the unaffected side (a late but definitive sign). It also compresses the vena cava, impeding venous return and causing JVD. Confirming these findings reinforces the need for immediate emergency action. Tracheal deviation and JVD are classic signs of tension pneumothorax, resulting from the increased pressure in the chest cavity compressing the mediastinum and great vessels."
