The worsening hypotension, elevated lactate and troponin levels, and jugular vein distention (JVD) all point to this critical condition. The priority is to recognize the deterioration, escalate care, and avoid interventions that could further compromise hemodynamics. \n\n**SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation):**\n*   **1300 Situation:** Client with massive PE is rapidly deteriorating, showing signs of obstructive shock.\n*   **Background:** Admitted 12 hours ago with bilateral PE. Initial treatment included oxygen and heparin infusion.\n*   **Assessment:** Now exhibiting hypotension (86/52), tachycardia (136 bpm), tachypnea (34 breaths/min), elevated lactate (4.2 mmol/L) and troponin (0.98 ng/mL), JVD, and altered mental status. Urine output decreased. aPTT is therapeutic.\n*   **Recommendation:** Activate RRT immediately. Withhold furosemide. Prepare for potential vasopressor support and advanced interventions (e.g., thrombolysis, embolectomy). Avoid fluid boluses unless specifically ordered by the provider after careful assessment.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In RV failure secondary to PE, the RV is preload-dependent. Diuretics and aggressive fluid removal can be detrimental. Hypotension should be managed with vasopressors, and fluid administration should be guided by careful hemodynamic monitoring.",
