Client reports losing their job two months ago and has been 'stretching out' their home hydrocortisone prescription to save money. On admission, the client was febrile and weak. Over the past 4 hours, the client has become increasingly lethargic and confused. Complains of diffuse abdominal pain and nausea. Skin is cool and clammy. Peripheral pulses are weak and thready. Two boluses of 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride were administered with minimal improvement in blood pressure."

    "analysis": "The client presents with hypotension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia, indicative of a potential adrenal crisis secondary to Addison's disease and non-adherence to hydrocortisone therapy. The most concerning finding is the hyperkalemia (Potassium 5.9 mEq/L). Addisonian crisis leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol deficiency causes hypoglycemia and contributes to hypotension. Aldosterone deficiency leads to sodium and water loss (hyponatremia, dehydration, hypotension) and potassium retention (hyperkalemia). The client's current presentation suggests distributive shock due to adrenal insufficiency. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is contraindicated in hyperkalemia as it further inhibits potassium excretion, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.",
    "action": "The priority nursing action is to withhold the spironolactone and immediately notify the healthcare provider of the client's elevated potassium level (5.9 mEq/L) and the potential for adverse effects. This prevents further elevation of potassium and potential cardiac complications. Subsequent actions include initiating fluid resuscitation with D5NS, preparing norepinephrine to address hypotension, and advocating for IV hydrocortisone administration to address the underlying adrenal insufficiency.",

    "Situation": "45-year-old client with Addison's disease admitted for pneumonia, now showing signs of adrenal crisis: hypotension (78/46 mmHg), tachycardia (135 bpm), altered mental status, and hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L).",
    "Background": "Client reports non-adherence to hydrocortisone due to financial constraints. Admitted 8 hours ago. Received two boluses of 500 mL 0.9% NaCl with minimal improvement. New prescriptions include D5NS, norepinephrine, and spironolactone 25mg STAT.",
