Client reports losing their job two months ago and has been 'stretching out' their home hydrocortisone prescription to save money. On admission, the client was febrile and weak. Over the past 4 hours, the client has become increasingly lethargic and confused. Complains of diffuse abdominal pain and nausea. Skin is cool and clammy. Peripheral pulses are weak and thready. Two boluses of 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride were administered with minimal improvement in blood pressure."

These cues strongly indicate an adrenal (Addisonian) crisis, a form of distributive shock. The most critical cue is the hyperkalemia (Potassium 5.9 mEq/L). The nurse must evaluate the new prescriptions for safety in this context. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Administering it to a client who is already hyperkalemic is a life-threatening contraindication that could precipitate fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The priority nursing action is to recognize this 'Safety Stop' and prevent harm.",

Administering this medication would worsen the hyperkalemia and could lead to cardiac arrest. This is the 'Don't Proceed' moment the nurse must identify."

The shock is likely due to adrenal crisis and will be refractory to vasopressors without corticosteroid replacement. The most urgent action is to address the unsafe medication order."
