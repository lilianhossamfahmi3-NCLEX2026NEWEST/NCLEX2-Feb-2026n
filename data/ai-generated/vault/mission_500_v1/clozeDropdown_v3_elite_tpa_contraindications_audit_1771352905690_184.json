It is an absolute contraindication for alteplase due to the extremely high risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In a client with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), the body's ability to form clots is already compromised. Administering alteplase further impairs clot formation, significantly increasing the risk of bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always meticulously review laboratory values, especially platelet count, before administering thrombolytics. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is generally considered an absolute contraindication.",

Proceeding would place the client at extreme risk for intracranial or systemic bleeding. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Thrombolytic therapy aims to dissolve existing blood clots. However, in the presence of severe thrombocytopenia, the body lacks the necessary platelets to maintain vascular integrity and prevent bleeding once the clot is dissolved (or if any vessel is damaged). This creates a high risk of uncontrolled hemorrhage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Remember the absolute contraindications for alteplase.

Recognizing the absolute contraindication, the nurse's primary responsibility is to withhold the medication and immediately communicate this critical finding to the provider to ensure the plan of care is re-evaluated and patient safety is maintained. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** By withholding alteplase, the nurse prevents the further breakdown of clots in a client who is already at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Notifying the stroke team physician allows for a reassessment of the client's condition and consideration of alternative treatment strategies that do not carry the same risk of hemorrhage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Never hesitate to question an order if you have concerns about patient safety.
