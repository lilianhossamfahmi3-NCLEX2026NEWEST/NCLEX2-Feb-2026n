    "correct": "The client's presentation of hyperglycemia (610 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21), and high anion gap (25) confirms Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The missed dialysis in a client with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) has led to a life-threateningly high potassium level of 7.4 mEq/L, confirmed by classic ECG changes (peaked T-waves, wide QRS). This severe hyperkalemia poses the most immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmia (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, asystole) due to its effect on myocardial membrane potential. Hyperkalemia reduces the resting membrane potential, making cardiac cells more excitable and prone to arrhythmias. The first priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane with IV calcium gluconate, which increases the threshold potential, protecting the heart. The nurse's next action is a critical safety stop: questioning the order for Lactated Ringer's. Lactated Ringer's contains approximately 4 mEq/L of potassium and is contraindicated in clients with hyperkalemia and renal failure, as its administration would worsen the already critical hyperkalemia. The nurse must advocate for a potassium-free isotonic fluid like 0.9% sodium chloride.",
    "incorrect": "Administering other correct medications before addressing the unsafe IV fluid order would be a serious error. Proceeding with the Lactated Ringer's infusion could be fatal. While other conditions are present or potential risks (acidosis, encephalopathy, shock), the immediate killer is the cardiotoxicity of the potassium. The nurse's primary responsibility is to identify and prevent harm from contraindicated orders. Insulin and dextrose will help shift potassium intracellularly, but this does not address the immediate threat of cardiac arrest. Hemodialysis is a longer-term solution for removing potassium, but the nurse must first ensure patient safety by addressing the contraindicated order.",
