Client states he fell yesterday but waited to come to the ED because he 'can't afford to miss work' and hoped it would 'get better on its own.'\n\n**1400 (On arrival to unit):** Alert and oriented x4. Cast applied to right lower leg, window intact. Distal neurovascular checks are within normal limits: capillary refill <3 seconds, toes warm, pink, brisk movement, denies numbness or tingling. Pain 6/10. Medicated with morphine IV.\n\n**2000 (Current):** Client reports escalating pain in right lower leg, rating it a '10/10' and describing it as a 'deep, constant burning.' States the cast feels 'extremely tight, like it's going to explode.' Pain is unrelieved by the 1745 dose of IV morphine. Client is anxious and diaphoretic. Distal pulses are faintly palpable via Doppler. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. Foot is cool and pale. Reports new-onset 'pins and needles' sensation in his toes."

        "correct": "The constellation of findings points to a limb- and life-threatening emergency: acute compartment syndrome with developing rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. The key 'STOP' cue is pain out of proportion to the injury and refractory to opioids. This signals ischemic tissue damage. This is further supported by the '6 Ps': Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia ('pins and needles'), faint Pulses, and Poikilothermia (coolness). The critically elevated CK confirms massive muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and the resulting hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine signal acute kidney injury. The only action that addresses the root cause is immediate surgical decompression (fasciotomy). Therefore, the nurse's absolute priority is to notify the surgeon immediately to prevent permanent neuromuscular damage, limb loss, and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias from hyperkalemia.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent common errors in judgment that could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Administering more opioids is a critical safety error as it masks the primary symptom of ischemia and delays definitive treatment. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it can worsen ischemia by decreasing arterial perfusion to the already compromised compartment. While cardiac monitoring is important due to the hyperkalemia, it is a secondary action; it monitors the complication but does not address the underlying cause. The priority is to initiate the treatment that will stop the pathologic process, which begins with notifying the surgeon.",

                "justification": "This is unsafe. The pain is ischemic, not solely nociceptive. It is a critical signal of nerve and muscle cell death due to high intercompartmental pressure. Administering more opioids would mask this key clinical sign, create a false sense of security, and delay the urgent surgical intervention required, leading to irreversible damage."

                "justification": "This is contraindicated and dangerous. In established compartment syndrome, pressure within the compartment exceeds arterial pressure. Elevating the limb above the heart will further decrease the arterial pressure gradient, reducing blood flow and worsening the ischemic injury. The limb should be kept at the level of the heart (neutral position)."

                "justification": "This is the correct priority 'SAFETY STOP' action. The clinical picture is a surgical emergency. The nurse must communicate these critical findings (uncontrolled pain, neurovascular changes, and critical lab values) to the surgeon to facilitate immediate evaluation for a fasciotomy. Delaying this call will result in permanent limb damage and worsen systemic complications."

The hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8) is a dangerous consequence of rhabdomyolysis and places the client at risk for fatal dysrhythmias. Cardiac monitoring is a necessary intervention. However, it treats a symptom, not the cause. The process causing the hyperkalemia (muscle death) must be stopped first. The absolute priority is to contact the surgeon to initiate definitive treatment (fasciotomy), which will halt the rhabdomyolysis. The nurse can delegate placing the cardiac monitor while making the call."
