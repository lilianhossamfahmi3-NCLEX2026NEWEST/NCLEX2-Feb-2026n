Key cues include the drop in blood pressure to 92/68, change in LOC to lethargy, development of atrial fibrillation with RVR, oliguria, rising troponin (indicating myocardial injury), and elevated lactate (indicating tissue hypoperfusion). The priority actions are to (1) Withhold propranolol, a beta-blocker whose negative inotropic effects would worsen cardiogenic shock; this is a critical 'DO NOT PROCEED' safety action. (2) Activate the RRT to bring immediate critical care resources to the bedside for stabilization. (3) Prepare for synchronized cardioversion, the definitive treatment for hemodynamically unstable tachyarrhythmias like A-fib with RVR.",
