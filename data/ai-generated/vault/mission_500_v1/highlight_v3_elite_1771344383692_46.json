    "correct": "The client's hyperkalemia (Potassium 6.8 mEq/L) and ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS) indicate life-threatening cardiotoxicity. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is contraindicated as it would further elevate potassium, risking fatal arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider. In adrenal crisis, mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency leads to sodium loss and potassium retention. The kidneys are unable to excrete potassium effectively, leading to hyperkalemia. The ECG changes reflect impaired myocardial repolarization and conduction due to the elevated potassium.",
    "incorrect": "Hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status are critical signs of adrenal crisis but do not specifically contraindicate spironolactone. These require immediate fluid resuscitation, dextrose, and steroid administration. However, the hyperkalemia poses the most immediate threat. Highlighting the spironolactone order itself is incorrect because the question asks for the *clinical findings* that justify withholding the medication.",

Background: Admitted for weakness, confusion, vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of hydrocortisone for one week. Assessment: Lethargic, hypotensive (74/44 mmHg), hyperkalemic (6.8 mEq/L) with peaked T waves and widened QRS. Recommendation: Withhold spironolactone, notify provider immediately, prepare for hyperkalemia treatment (calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose).",
