These findings are an absolute contraindication for administering spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic. Administering spironolactone would worsen the hyperkalemia, potentially leading to ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The nurse's priority is to recognize these critical findings, withhold the contraindicated medication, and immediately notify the provider to prevent a fatal medication error.",

The hypotension requires aggressive fluid and steroid resuscitation. The hypoglycemia requires dextrose. However, the severe hyperkalemia and its ECG manifestations are the 'killer' findings that make the administration of a potassium-sparing drug an immediate, life-threatening error. Highlighting the spironolactone order itself is incorrect because it is the *action to be taken*, not the *clinical finding* that justifies the action.",
