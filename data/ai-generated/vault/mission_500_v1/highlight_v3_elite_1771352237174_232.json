Client reports sudden-onset shortness of breath and sharp right-sided chest pain that started approximately 2 hours ago. States he 'felt dizzy, then blacked out' while walking to the bathroom, resulting in an unwitnessed fall. Client reports striking his head on a tile floor. He complains of a moderate headache, rated 5/10, and denies loss of consciousness. Client has a history of hypertension and underwent a right total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 10 days ago. He reports inconsistent use of prescribed enoxaparin post-operatively, stating, 'I have a hard time getting to the pharmacy.' Noted 2 cm hematoma to right temporal area, no active bleeding."

        "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from multiple sources to identify a life-threatening contraindication. The client has a confirmed pulmonary embolism and requires anticoagulation. However, the nurse's note documents a syncopal episode with a fall and head strike. The preliminary report for the Head CT, which was performed due to the fall, reveals a 'hyperdensity... suspicious for an acute intraparenchymal contusion.' This indicates a brain bleed. Initiating a heparin infusion, a potent anticoagulant, in a client with an active intracranial hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication and would likely lead to catastrophic expansion of the bleed, brain herniation, and death. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent harm (non-maleficence). Therefore, the nurse must withhold the heparin infusion and immediately contact the provider to report the critical Head CT finding and question the order.",
        "incorrect": "The other orders are appropriate and address the client's immediate needs safely. Admitting to telemetry is necessary for cardiac monitoring in a PE. Supplemental oxygen is required to treat the hypoxia caused by the ventilation-perfusion mismatch from the PE. Obtaining baseline coagulation studies is a standard prerequisite for initiating anticoagulation therapy, but does not justify starting the therapy in the face of a contraindication. A pulmonology consult is appropriate for managing a large PE. Only the order to initiate heparin poses an immediate, life-threatening risk given the new finding of a brain injury.",
