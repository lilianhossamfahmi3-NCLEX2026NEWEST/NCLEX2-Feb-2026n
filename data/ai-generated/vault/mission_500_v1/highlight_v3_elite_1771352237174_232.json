States he 'felt dizzy, then blacked out' while walking to the bathroom, resulting in an unwitnessed fall. Client reports striking his head on a tile floor. He complains of a moderate headache, rated 5/10, and denies loss of consciousness. Client has a history of hypertension and underwent a right total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 10 days ago. He reports inconsistent use of prescribed enoxaparin post-operatively, stating, 'I have a hard time getting to the pharmacy.' Noted 2 cm hematoma to right temporal area, no active bleeding."

    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from multiple sources to identify a life-threatening contraindication. The client presents with a PE, requiring anticoagulation. However, the nurse's note documents a syncopal episode with a fall and head strike. The preliminary Head CT report reveals a 'hyperdensity... suspicious for an acute intraparenchymal contusion,' indicating a potential brain bleed. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* An intraparenchymal contusion represents bleeding within the brain tissue itself. Heparin, a potent anticoagulant, inhibits the formation of fibrin clots by enhancing antithrombin III activity. This prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, thereby disrupting the coagulation cascade. In the presence of an active brain bleed, heparin would impede the body's natural ability to form clots to stop the hemorrhage, leading to expansion of the hematoma.\n\nInitiating a heparin infusion in a client with a suspected intracranial hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication and could lead to catastrophic expansion of the bleed, brain herniation, and death. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent harm (non-maleficence). Therefore, the nurse must withhold the heparin infusion and immediately contact the provider to report the critical Head CT finding and question the order.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Always consider the potential for underlying head trauma in patients presenting with altered mental status or falls, especially in the elderly or those on anticoagulants. A CT scan of the head is crucial to rule out intracranial hemorrhage before initiating or continuing anticoagulation therapy.",
    "incorrect": "The other orders are appropriate and address the client's immediate needs safely. Admitting to telemetry is necessary for cardiac monitoring in a PE. Supplemental oxygen is required to treat the hypoxia caused by the ventilation-perfusion mismatch from the PE. Obtaining baseline coagulation studies is a standard prerequisite for initiating anticoagulation therapy, but does not justify starting the therapy in the face of a contraindication. A pulmonology consult is appropriate for managing a large PE. Only the order to initiate heparin poses an immediate, life-threatening risk given the new finding of a brain injury.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Remember the absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, including active bleeding (especially intracranial), severe thrombocytopenia, and recent major surgery. Always weigh the risks and benefits before initiating anticoagulation therapy.\n",
