    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of pneumonia complicated by sepsis-induced Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). The most immediate threat is Hyperkalemia-induced Cardiac Toxicity, evidenced by a critical serum potassium of 6.8 mEq/L and peaked T-waves on the ECG. Hyperkalemia disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes, leading to increased excitability and potentially fatal arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The client's report of 'muscle heaviness' is a neuromuscular manifestation of hyperkalemia.\n\nThe priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. The nurse should first withhold the scheduled lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, which can further elevate potassium levels by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. Next, administer IV calcium gluconate, which does not lower serum potassium but rapidly stabilizes the myocardial cell membrane, counteracting the arrhythmogenic effects of hyperkalemia. \n\nFollowing these interventions, continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to assess for resolution of ECG changes or progression to more dangerous arrhythmias. Serial serum potassium levels are also essential to guide further potassium-lowering therapies such as insulin/dextrose or dialysis.",
    "incorrect": "The client does have sepsis and AKI, but the immediate threat is cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia. Septic shock is a concern, but the blood pressure is not yet refractory to fluids. ARDS is not the primary issue, as SpO2 is borderline but not indicative of severe hypoxemia. A negative troponin rules out acute MI. Uremic encephalopathy is possible with a high BUN, but the client is currently alert and oriented.\n\nAdministering furosemide is inappropriate due to kidney failure (oliguria, high creatinine) and will not effectively lower potassium. A fluid bolus is a lower priority than stabilizing the heart and could worsen pulmonary edema. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate acts too slowly for this acute crisis.\n\nMonitoring urine output, creatinine, and blood pressure are important for AKI/sepsis management but are secondary to monitoring the immediate life-threat of cardiac arrhythmia and its underlying cause.",

Administering it with a K+ of 6.8 mEq/L would worsen the electrolyte imbalance. ACE inhibitors reduce aldosterone secretion, which normally promotes potassium excretion. Withholding the medication prevents further potassium retention."
