    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of impending brain herniation, a life-threatening condition caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The vital signs at 2000 (Cushing's Triad: hypertension with widening pulse pressure [188/72 mmHg], bradycardia [50 bpm], and irregular respirations [10/min]) are indicative of significant pressure on the brainstem. Decerebrate posturing, noted in the 2000 nursing note, signifies severe brainstem compression. The CT scan confirms a large subdural hematoma causing mass effect and midline shift, further elevating ICP. The priority nursing actions are aimed at reducing ICP and preventing further neurological damage. Immediately stopping the D5W infusion is crucial because D5W is a hypotonic solution that, once metabolized, results in free water shifting into brain cells, exacerbating cerebral edema and increasing ICP. Administering mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, will draw fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular space, reducing ICP. Monitoring pupillary response (size, equality, reactivity) is essential for assessing cranial nerve III (oculomotor) function and detecting further brainstem compression. Hourly urine output monitoring is vital to evaluate the effectiveness of mannitol in promoting diuresis and to detect potential complications like diabetes insipidus (DI) due to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.",
    "incorrect": "Placing the client in a supine, flat position is contraindicated as it increases ICP by impeding venous drainage from the brain. Fentanyl is inappropriate because it can cause respiratory depression, mask neurological changes, and potentially lower blood pressure, reducing cerebral perfusion. While the client is hypoxic, a nasal cannula is insufficient; the client requires intubation and mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitoring core body temperature and serum sodium levels are less immediate priorities compared to assessing neurological function and the response to interventions aimed at reducing ICP. Abdominal girth is not relevant to this clinical scenario.",
