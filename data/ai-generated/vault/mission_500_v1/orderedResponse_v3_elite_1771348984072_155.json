The highest priority is to prevent iatrogenic harm. The client's platelet count is critically low at 45,000/mm³, indicating severe thrombocytopenia and a profound risk for spontaneous hemorrhage. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits platelet aggregation, which would further increase the risk of bleeding. Administering this medication would be a critical safety error. Therefore, the first and most crucial action is to withhold the ketorolac. Following this immediate 'safety stop,' the nurse must communicate the critical findings (especially the low platelets) to the provider. Next, implement standard safety protocols like seizure precautions due to the high risk of eclampsia. Then, address the severe hypertension with the ordered labetalol. Finally, since the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome is delivery of the fetus, preparing for an imminent cesarean delivery is the appropriate final step in this sequence.",
