The client's symptoms of weakness, nausea, and dyspnea are being caused by the MI, not just uremia. Proceeding with hemodialysis is absolutely contraindicated. The ultrafiltration and fluid removal would cause profound hypotension and hemodynamic collapse, worsening myocardial ischemia and likely leading to cardiac arrest.
