Administering another dose would be life-threatening. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action."

Administering the scheduled potassium chloride is a crucial step to begin correcting the electrolyte imbalance that is contributing to the cardiac instability."

This combination places the client at high risk for fatal dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection of any deterioration."

The client's apical heart rate is below the standard threshold of 60 bpm for holding digoxin, and there is overwhelming evidence of toxicity. Proceeding with administration could lead to complete heart block or fatal ventricular arrhythmias."
