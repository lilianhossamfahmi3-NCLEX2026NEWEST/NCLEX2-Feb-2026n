The client exhibits multiple signs of digoxin toxicity: a serum level of 2.4 ng/mL (above the 0.8-2.0 ng/mL therapeutic range), bradycardia (HR 52 bpm), visual disturbances ('yellowish' halos), nausea, and ECG changes (PVCs, ST scooping). Digoxin toxicity occurs because digoxin inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium, which enhances cardiac contractility but also increases the risk of arrhythmias. Hypokalemia exacerbates this effect by increasing digoxin binding to the pump. Administering another dose would be life-threatening. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action.",

      "rationale": "Correct. The client's potassium level is 2.9 mEq/L, which is critically low (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity because low extracellular potassium enhances digoxin binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, further inhibiting its function and increasing intracellular sodium and calcium. This leads to increased cardiac excitability and arrhythmias. Administering the scheduled potassium chloride is a crucial step to begin correcting the electrolyte imbalance that is contributing to the cardiac instability.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Potassium replacement should be initiated cautiously, especially in patients with renal impairment, to avoid hyperkalemia. Monitor ECG during potassium administration for signs of hyperkalemia (peaked T waves).",

Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection of any deterioration, allowing for prompt intervention with antiarrhythmics or other supportive measures.",

It is a critical nursing responsibility to immediately communicate these comprehensive findings to the healthcare provider to obtain orders for further intervention, which may include Digoxin Immune Fab (Digibind). Digibind binds to digoxin, preventing it from binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump and reversing its toxic effects.",
