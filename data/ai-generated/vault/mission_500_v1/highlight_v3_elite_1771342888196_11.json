    "correct": "The nurse must withhold the insulin infusion and immediately address the critical hypokalemia. Insulin administration drives potassium from the extracellular space into the intracellular space, which would rapidly worsen the client's already low potassium level (3.1 mEq/L). The ECG findings of flattened T waves and prominent U waves confirm that this hypokalemia is already having a significant cardiac effect, placing the client at high risk for life-threatening arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) or cardiac arrest if insulin is given. Standard evidence-based protocols for HHS/DKA management mandate that insulin therapy be held until the serum potassium is corrected to a level of at least 3.3 mEq/L to prevent iatrogenic cardiac arrest. The nurse's priority is to initiate potassium replacement and notify the provider. \n\nPathophysiology: In HHS, severe hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, causing profound dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, including potassium depletion. Insulin facilitates glucose entry into cells, and it also enhances potassium uptake by cells via activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. Administering insulin in the presence of hypokalemia can cause a precipitous drop in serum potassium, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially fatal outcomes. The flattened T waves and prominent U waves on the ECG are indicative of impaired repolarization of the cardiac myocytes due to hypokalemia.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent expected findings or appropriate interventions for HHS that do not constitute an immediate contraindication to planned therapy. While abnormal, they are part of the clinical picture of HHS. The core safety issue is recognizing the one factor (hypokalemia) that makes a standard treatment (insulin) lethal.",

This is an absolute contraindication for starting an insulin infusion. The client must receive potassium replacement to raise the level above 3.3 mEq/L before insulin can be safely administered. \n\nPathophysiology: Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, promoting potassium entry into cells.

This finding provides critical evidence that the low potassium level is already affecting cardiac myocyte repolarization, signaling an imminent risk of fatal arrhythmia. It is a 'hard stop' sign that confirms the danger of administering insulin at this time. \n\nPathophysiology: Hypokalemia prolongs the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential, leading to flattened T waves and prominent U waves on the ECG. This increases the risk of re-entrant arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes."
