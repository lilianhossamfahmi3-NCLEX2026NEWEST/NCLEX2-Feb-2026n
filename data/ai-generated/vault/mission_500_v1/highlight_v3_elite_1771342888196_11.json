Insulin administration drives potassium from the extracellular space into the intracellular space, which would rapidly worsen the client's already low potassium level (3.1 mEq/L). The ECG findings of flattened T waves and prominent U waves confirm that this hypokalemia is already having a significant cardiac effect, placing the client at high risk for life-threatening arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) or cardiac arrest if insulin is given. Standard evidence-based protocols for HHS/DKA management mandate that insulin therapy be held until the serum potassium is corrected to a level of at least 3.3 mEq/L to prevent iatrogenic cardiac arrest. The nurse's priority is to initiate potassium replacement and notify the provider.",
