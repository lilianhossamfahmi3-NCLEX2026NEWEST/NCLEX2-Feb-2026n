This hyperkalemia is manifesting as peaked T waves on the ECG, a sign of cardiac membrane instability that precedes life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Therefore, the client's highest risk is cardiac arrest. The nurse's priority independent action is to prevent any iatrogenic harm that could worsen this condition. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated because it can cause hyperkalemia by inhibiting aldosterone secretion, which promotes potassium excretion. Administering this medication would be unsafe and could precipitate a cardiac event. Withholding the medication and notifying the provider is the correct 'safety stop' action.",

While acidosis, uremia, and fluid status are concerns in AKI, the immediate threat to life is the cardiotoxic effect of the severe hyperkalemia. Other actions, while potentially appropriate later, are not the priority. Requesting calcium gluconate is a correct dependent action, but the independent 'stop and do no harm' action comes first. Administering the antibiotic is necessary for the sepsis but does not address the immediate life-threat. Increasing IV fluids does not correct severe hyperkalemia quickly enough and is not the priority over preventing its worsening.",
