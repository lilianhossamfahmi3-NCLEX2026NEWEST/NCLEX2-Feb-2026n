Hyperkalemia reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, increasing their excitability and predisposing them to arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The priority nursing action is to withhold the scheduled lisinopril. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can further elevate potassium levels by inhibiting aldosterone, which promotes potassium excretion. Administering lisinopril in this situation could precipitate a cardiac arrest. Withholding the medication is a critical 'safety stop' to prevent further harm. The nurse should then notify the provider immediately.",

Rapid fluid administration could worsen hyperkalemia.\n*   **Seizure activity due to uremia:** Although a high BUN can cause neurological symptoms, the hyperkalemia poses a more immediate risk.\n*   **Request an order for IV calcium gluconate:** While calcium gluconate can stabilize the cardiac membrane in hyperkalemia, withholding the potassium-elevating medication is the priority independent action.\n*   **Administer the piperacillin-tazobactam:** Treating the sepsis is important, but preventing cardiac arrest takes precedence.\n*   **Increase the normal saline infusion rate:** This does not directly address the hyperkalemia and could worsen fluid overload, especially with impaired kidney function.",
