Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and seizures. While the client has ESRD, the *worsening* of neurological symptoms *after* dialysis makes uremic encephalopathy less likely. Dialysis removes uremic toxins, so a flare-up post-dialysis is unexpected. The client's presentation is more consistent with a complication *of* the dialysis itself, specifically DDS.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. An acute subdural hematoma (SDH) involves bleeding between the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges, often due to trauma or anticoagulation. While dialysis involves anticoagulation, the rapid onset and specific constellation of symptoms (especially the bradycardia and hypertension) are less typical of SDH. SDH would present with a more gradual decline and focal neurological deficits. Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS) is a more likely explanation given the recent dialysis and high pre-dialysis BUN. The pathophysiology of DDS involves cerebral edema, which can cause similar symptoms but is triggered by the rapid osmotic shifts during dialysis.",

This rapid solute removal creates an osmotic gradient, causing fluid to shift into the brain cells, leading to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The client's symptoms – headache, nausea, progressive lethargy, confusion, and vital sign changes (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) – are consistent with increased ICP secondary to DDS. The high pre-dialysis BUN (165 mg/dL) and the recent initiation of dialysis increase the risk of DDS.",

While the client's blood pressure is elevated (188/94 mmHg), this is likely a *symptom* of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) rather than a primary hypertensive crisis. The combination of hypertension, bradycardia (54/min), and irregular respirations is concerning for Cushing's triad, a classic sign of increased ICP. The underlying cause of the increased ICP is most likely cerebral edema from DDS, not uncontrolled hypertension alone.

Proceeding with the scheduled dialysis would exacerbate the client's cerebral edema and potentially lead to seizures, coma, brain herniation, and death.

While a head CT scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cerebral edema and rule out other causes of neurological decline (e.g., hemorrhage), the nurse's *priority* action is to first stop the impending dialysis and notify the provider. Requesting a CT scan is a collaborative action that follows the immediate safety intervention of stopping the procedure that is causing harm.

Today at 0800, client is lethargic, confused (oriented to person only), and reports headache and dizziness.

Notify the provider STAT at 0815 to obtain orders for managing cerebral edema (e.g., hypertonic saline or mannitol) and emergent neurological evaluation, including a head CT scan.
