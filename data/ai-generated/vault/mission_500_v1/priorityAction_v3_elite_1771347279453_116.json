This is a medical emergency that can lead to fatal dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The client is also anuric with a significantly elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys are unable to excrete potassium. Lactated Ringer's (LR) is a balanced crystalloid solution that contains potassium (4 mEq/L). Continuing the LR infusion would directly worsen the hyperkalemia and increase the risk of cardiac arrest. Therefore, the absolute priority is to stop the administration of any potassium-containing fluids ('DON'T PROCEED'/'SAFETY STOP') and immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate).",

Continuing to infuse potassium while titrating vasopressors is unsafe. The root cause of the immediate danger must be addressed first."
