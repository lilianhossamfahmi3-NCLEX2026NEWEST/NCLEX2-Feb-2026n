In a client with severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/mm³), intramuscular (IM) injections are contraindicated. Administering an IM injection creates a high risk of a large, uncontrollable hematoma at the injection site, which would exacerbate bleeding in a client who is already coagulopathic and hemodynamically unstable. The nurse must recognize this as a critical safety risk and question the order immediately. Maternal stabilization is the absolute priority over the administration of steroids for fetal lung maturity at this time.",

An IM injection can cause severe, uncontrolled bleeding and hematoma formation. The immediate risk of hemorrhage from the injection outweighs the benefit of fetal lung maturation.
