    "correct": "The order to administer betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly (IM) now requires immediate clarification. The client exhibits signs and symptoms indicative of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening complication of placental abruption. The petechiae, oozing from the IV site, hypotension (88/50 mmHg), tachycardia (125 bpm), thrombocytopenia (platelets 45,000/mm³), low fibrinogen (90 mg/dL), and elevated D-dimer (>10 mcg/mL) strongly suggest DIC. DIC involves widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in both thrombosis and hemorrhage. IM injections are contraindicated in clients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/mm³) due to the high risk of hematoma formation and uncontrollable bleeding at the injection site. The risk of hemorrhage outweighs the potential benefit of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity at this critical time. Maternal stabilization is the priority.",

An IM injection can cause severe, uncontrolled bleeding and hematoma formation. The immediate risk of hemorrhage from the injection outweighs the benefit of fetal lung maturation. The nurse has a duty to recognize this contraindication and clarify the order with the provider."
