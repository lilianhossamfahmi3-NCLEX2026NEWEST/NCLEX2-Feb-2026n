            "analyzeCues": "The nurse analyzes multiple data points. The client presents with classic signs of an ischemic stroke (aphasia, hemiparesis) with a high NIHSS score of 16. The head CT confirms an ischemic event without hemorrhage, which would typically clear the client for alteplase. However, two critical contraindications are present. First, the last known normal (LKN) time was 'around 21:00 last night,' which is far outside the 3-4.5 hour window for tPA administration. Second, and more critically from the lab data, the platelet count is 75,000/mm³. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase due to the profound risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage.",
            "takeAction": "The nurse's priority action is to prevent a catastrophic medication error. Recognizing the absolute contraindication of thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100,000/mm³), the nurse must immediately stop the planned intervention. The most critical action is to hold the medication and communicate this critical finding to the ordering provider immediately to ensure the plan of care is re-evaluated for safety.",
            "options": {
                "opt_1": "Incorrect. Although the client's blood pressure is elevated, it is currently 184/98 mmHg, which is just below the 185/110 mmHg threshold requiring treatment before tPA. More importantly, treating the blood pressure implies intent to proceed with the alteplase, which is contraindicated. Addressing the absolute contraindication (platelets) is the highest priority.",
                "opt_2": "Correct. This is the paramount safety action. The platelet count of 75,000/mm³ is a critical lab value and an absolute contraindication to alteplase administration. Proceeding would place the client at extremely high risk for a fatal hemorrhagic conversion of their stroke. The nurse must act as the final safety barrier by holding the drug and immediately notifying the provider of this contraindication.",
                "opt_3": "Incorrect. Verifying weight for dose calculation is a standard safety check for administering alteplase. However, this step is moot because the medication is absolutely contraindicated. The priority is not to prepare the dose correctly, but to prevent the administration of an unsafe medication altogether.",
                "opt_4": "Incorrect. This is the most dangerous action. Administering alteplase in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia demonstrates a critical failure to recognize a life-threatening contraindication and could result in the client's death from intracranial hemorrhage.",
                "opt_5": "Incorrect. The client's social situation (living alone, rural area) is an important consideration for discharge planning and represents a Social Determinant of Health (SDOH) factor. However, it is not the priority in this acute, life-threatening situation. Immediate physiological safety must be addressed first.",
                "opt_6": "Incorrect. Establishing a second IV line is a good practice for stroke patients who may require multiple infusions, but it is a procedural task. It does not take priority over the critical thinking required to identify a contraindication and prevent a life-threatening medication error."
