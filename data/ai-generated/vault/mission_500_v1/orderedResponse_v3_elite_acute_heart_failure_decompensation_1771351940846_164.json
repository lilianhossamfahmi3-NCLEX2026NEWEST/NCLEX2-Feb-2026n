Reports a 4.5 kg (10 lb) weight gain over the last week. Client states, 'I couldn't get a ride to the pharmacy last week, so I ran out of my water pills.' On admission, client was alert and oriented x3, with audible crackles in bilateral lung bases and 3+ pitting edema to the mid-calves. Oxygen applied at 2 L/min via nasal cannula.\n\nCurrent Note (Now):\nClient is increasingly lethargic and slow to respond to questions. Skin is cool to the touch and appears pale. Respirations are shallow. Peripheral pulses are thready."

The client's blood pressure has dropped precipitously to 88/56 mmHg, and they are exhibiting clear signs of hypoperfusion (lethargy, cool skin, tachycardia, elevated lactate of 4.2 mmol/L). This indicates iatrogenic cardiogenic shock caused by excessive vasodilation from the nitroglycerin. Stopping the offending agent is the immediate life-saving intervention to prevent further cardiovascular collapse. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action."

It would further decrease intravascular volume, worsen hypotension, and accelerate end-organ damage. This action demonstrates a failure to recognize a life-threatening change and is contraindicated."

                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Correct - Step 2. Immediately after stopping the cause of the shock, the nurse must activate the Rapid Response Team or call for provider assistance. The client is critically unstable, and a multidisciplinary team is required to manage the shock state with potential interventions like vasopressors or inotropes."

                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Correct - Step 3. While awaiting the RRT, the nurse should perform rapid, independent actions to support perfusion. Placing the client supine (and potentially elevating the lower extremities, though not specified) uses gravity to promote venous return to the core and brain, which can help stabilize blood pressure. This is a non-invasive, quick supportive measure."

                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "Correct - Step 4. After initiating life-saving interventions and calling for help, a rapid, focused assessment is crucial. Assessing breath sounds is vital to determine if the shock state is worsening pulmonary congestion, which would complicate fluid resuscitation decisions. This provides essential data for the responding team."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While an ECG may be useful to rule out an ischemic event contributing to the decompensation, it is not the priority over stabilizing the client's hemodynamics. The cause of the shock is overwhelmingly likely to be the nitroglycerin infusion given the clinical data. Stopping the infusion, calling for help, and repositioning are more immediate and impactful actions."
