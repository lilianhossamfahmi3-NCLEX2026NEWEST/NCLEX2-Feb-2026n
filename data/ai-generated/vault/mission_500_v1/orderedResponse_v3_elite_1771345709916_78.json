    "correct": "The client's clinical data indicates acute compartment syndrome complicated by rhabdomyolysis, leading to life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 6.2 mEq/L) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (Creatinine 1.9 mg/dL). The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves the release of intracellular potassium into the bloodstream due to muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis. This excess potassium disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to potentially fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. AKI occurs due to the large myoglobin molecules released during rhabdomyolysis obstructing the renal tubules, causing direct tubular damage and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Hyperkalemia poses the most immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Therefore, the nurse's highest priority is to communicate these critical findings to the surgeon and anesthesia provider, as this may alter the surgical plan and requires immediate medical intervention, such as administering calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, insulin and glucose to shift potassium intracellularly, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body. The next immediate action is to place the client on a cardiac monitor to detect any dysrhythmias. The nurse must then withhold the nephrotoxic ketorolac to prevent worsening the AKI. Ketorolac, an NSAID, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction in the kidneys and reduced renal blood flow, further compromising kidney function in the setting of AKI. After these critical safety actions are completed, routine pre-operative tasks like administering prophylactic antibiotics and ensuring paperwork is complete can be addressed.",
    "incorrect": "Performing routine tasks before addressing life-threatening conditions constitutes a serious safety error. Administering ketorolac would cause further kidney damage by further reducing renal blood flow and exacerbating tubular injury. Proceeding to the OR without notifying the team of the critical potassium level places the client at high risk for cardiac arrest during anesthesia induction due to the arrhythmogenic effects of anesthesia combined with hyperkalemia. Prioritizing administrative tasks over physiological stability is incorrect.",

        "label": "Rank 1",
        "content": "Notify the surgeon and anesthesia provider of critical lab values.",
        "justification": "This is the highest priority action. The K+ of 6.2 mEq/L and Creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL represent life-threatening emergencies that the entire team must be aware of immediately. This communication is essential to 'stop the line,' re-evaluate the plan, and initiate emergent treatment for hyperkalemia and AKI before the client can safely undergo anesthesia and surgery. Hyperkalemia can rapidly lead to cardiac arrest, and AKI can have long-term consequences if not addressed promptly."

        "label": "Rank 2",
        "content": "Place the client on a continuous cardiac monitor.",
        "justification": "This is the most important independent nursing action to ensure client safety. Hyperkalemia can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., peaked T-waves, ventricular fibrillation). Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and intervention, directly addressing the primary life threat while awaiting further orders. Early detection of arrhythmias allows for timely administration of medications like calcium gluconate or initiation of other potassium-lowering therapies."

        "content": "Withhold the scheduled dose of ketorolac.",
        "justification": "This is a critical 'DO NOT PROCEED' safety action. Ketorolac is a potent NSAID and is highly nephrotoxic. Administering it to a client with rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI would exacerbate kidney damage. Withholding this medication prevents iatrogenic harm. NSAIDs reduce renal blood flow, which is already compromised in AKI, potentially leading to further kidney damage and prolonged recovery."

        "label": "Rank 4",
        "content": "Administer the prescribed pre-operative Cefazolin.",
        "justification": "Administering prophylactic antibiotics is a vital pre-operative task to prevent surgical site infection. However, it is a lower priority than addressing imminent threats of cardiac arrest and preventing further organ damage. This action should only be performed after the critical issues have been communicated and managed. Cefazolin is important for preventing infection, but it does not address the immediate life-threatening risks posed by hyperkalemia and AKI."

      {
        "label": "Rank 5",
        "content": "Confirm the surgical consent form is signed and witnessed.",
        "justification": "While legally necessary for the procedure, this administrative task is the lowest priority in this acute scenario. Physiological stability and preventing life-threatening events always take precedence over paperwork. This can be completed once the client is stabilized. Delaying the surgery slightly to address the critical lab values and stabilize the client is safer than proceeding without addressing these issues."
