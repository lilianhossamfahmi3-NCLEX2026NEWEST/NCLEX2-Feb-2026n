Hyperkalemia poses the most immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Therefore, the nurse's highest priority is to communicate these critical findings to the surgeon and anesthesia provider, as this may alter the surgical plan and requires immediate medical intervention. The next immediate action is to place the client on a cardiac monitor to detect any dysrhythmias. The nurse must then withhold the nephrotoxic ketorolac to prevent worsening the AKI. After these critical safety actions are completed, routine pre-operative tasks like administering prophylactic antibiotics and ensuring paperwork is complete can be addressed.",
        "incorrect": "Performing routine tasks before addressing life-threatening conditions constitutes a serious safety error. Administering ketorolac would cause further kidney damage. Proceeding to the OR without notifying the team of the critical potassium level places the client at high risk for cardiac arrest during anesthesia induction. Prioritizing administrative tasks over physiological stability is incorrect.",

The K+ of 6.2 mEq/L and Creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL represent life-threatening emergencies that the entire team must be aware of immediately. This communication is essential to 'stop the line,' re-evaluate the plan, and initiate emergent treatment for hyperkalemia and AKI before the client can safely undergo anesthesia and surgery."
