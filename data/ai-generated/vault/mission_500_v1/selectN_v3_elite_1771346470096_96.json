This is evidenced by the triad of hypotension (88/52), persistent tachycardia (155 bpm), and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (confusion, cool/clammy skin, elevated lactate, acute kidney injury). The priority actions are to stabilize the client and escalate care. Notifying the RRT/provider is critical for immediate intervention. Applying high-flow oxygen addresses the severe hypoxemia (SpO2 89%). Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position will decrease preload and reduce pulmonary congestion, easing the work of breathing.",

Administering a beta-blocker to a hypotensive client in cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening error. Giving an oral medication is not a priority in a client with altered mental status and hemodynamic instability. A fluid bolus is generally contraindicated in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema (crackles) as it will worsen fluid overload and respiratory failure.",

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.
