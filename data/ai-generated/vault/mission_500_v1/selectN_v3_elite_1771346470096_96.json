    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) progressing to cardiogenic shock. The pathophysiology involves the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. This is evidenced by hypotension (88/52), persistent tachycardia (155 bpm), and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (confusion, cool/clammy skin, elevated lactate, acute kidney injury). The elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. The priority actions are to stabilize the client and escalate care. Notifying the RRT/provider is critical for immediate intervention to address the underlying cause of the cardiogenic shock. Applying high-flow oxygen addresses the severe hypoxemia (SpO2 89%), improving oxygen delivery to vital organs. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position will decrease preload and reduce pulmonary congestion, easing the work of breathing and improving oxygenation.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either contraindicated, unsafe, or not the immediate priority. Administering a beta-blocker to a hypotensive client in cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening error as it further reduces cardiac output. Giving an oral medication is not a priority in a client with altered mental status and hemodynamic instability. A fluid bolus is generally contraindicated in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema (crackles) as it will worsen fluid overload and respiratory failure. The underlying pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock is pump failure, not hypovolemia.",

Although the heart rate is >130 bpm, meeting the PRN parameter, the client is now severely hypotensive (88/52) and showing signs of cardiogenic shock (cool/clammy skin, confusion, high lactate). Metoprolol is a beta-blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. In cardiogenic shock, the heart's ability to contract is already compromised. Administering metoprolol would further decrease cardiac contractility and output, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse.
