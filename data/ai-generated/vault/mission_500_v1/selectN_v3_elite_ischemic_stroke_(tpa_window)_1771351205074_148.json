Client lives alone in a remote rural area. The client's daughter, contacted by phone, reports a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (prescribed apixaban), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) which has been in remission for several years. She states the client is 'not always good about taking his pills.' Last known well (LKW) confirmed as 1300. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18."

The standard guideline is that the platelet count must be greater than 100,000/mm³ to minimize the risk of severe hemorrhage. The history of ITP, even in remission, is a critical piece of historical data that correlates with this lab finding. This finding represents a significant safety risk, and the nurse must withhold the medication."

Alteplase is contraindicated in clients with a systolic blood pressure >185 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure >110 mmHg due to the increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Although an order for labetalol is present, the alteplase cannot be administered until the blood pressure is successfully lowered and maintained below the 185/110 mmHg threshold. Therefore, the current BP requires the nurse to withhold the drug."
