Client lives alone in a remote rural area. The client's daughter, contacted by phone, reports a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (prescribed apixaban), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) which has been in remission for several years. She states the client is 'not always good about taking his pills.' Last known well (LKW) confirmed as 1300. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18."

      "rationale": "Correct. The client's platelet count is 78,000/mm³, which is below the generally accepted threshold of 100,000/mm³ for safe alteplase administration. Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, works by dissolving clots, but it also carries a significant risk of bleeding. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) impairs the body's ability to form clots, increasing the risk of hemorrhage, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. The client's history of ITP, even if in remission, raises concern for potential platelet dysfunction. The nurse must withhold the medication and notify the provider immediately.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Alteplase is contraindicated with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mm3) due to increased risk of bleeding. Always review lab values before administration."

      "optionId": "opt_02",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's blood pressure is elevated at 192/112 mmHg. Uncontrolled hypertension is a contraindication to alteplase administration because it significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Alteplase can cause reperfusion injury to weakened blood vessels in the brain, and high blood pressure exacerbates this risk, potentially leading to vessel rupture and bleeding into the brain tissue. The order for labetalol indicates an attempt to control the blood pressure, but alteplase cannot be administered until the blood pressure is consistently below 185/110 mmHg.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hypertension is a major contraindication for alteplase. Ensure blood pressure is controlled below 185/110 mmHg before and during administration."

      "rationale": "Incorrect. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of embolic stroke. While it necessitates anticoagulation in the long term, it is not a contraindication to acute thrombolytic therapy with alteplase, provided other criteria are met. The presence of atrial fibrillation explains the likely etiology of the stroke (cardioembolic) but does not preclude treatment to restore blood flow to the affected brain tissue.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. The last known well time was 1300, and the current time is approximately 1530, placing the client within the 3-4.5 hour window for alteplase administration. The time window is crucial because the effectiveness of alteplase decreases as time passes due to irreversible ischemic damage to the brain tissue. The fact that the client is within the acceptable timeframe supports the potential use of alteplase, assuming other criteria are met.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Time is brain! Alteplase is most effective when administered within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset. Confirm the 'last known well' time."

      "rationale": "Incorrect. An INR of 1.1 is within the normal range (0.8-1.2). For clients on anticoagulants, an INR ≤1.7 is generally considered safe for alteplase administration. This value indicates that the client is not currently significantly anticoagulated, which reduces the risk of bleeding complications associated with alteplase. The INR result suggests the client may not have been compliant with their prescribed apixaban, but the current value does not contraindicate alteplase.",
      "clinicalPearl": "An elevated INR (>1.7) increases the risk of bleeding with alteplase. Verify INR is within acceptable limits before administration."

This imaging is essential to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, as alteplase is absolutely contraindicated in such cases. The CT result confirms that the client is experiencing an ischemic stroke, making them a potential candidate for thrombolytic therapy, provided other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.",
