High PEEP can cause alveolar rupture, leading to air accumulation in the pleural space. This compresses the lung and mediastinal structures, impairing venous return and cardiac output (obstructive shock). The priority is to activate the Rapid Response Team (RRT) and notify the provider for immediate intervention. Preparing for needle decompression and chest tube insertion is crucial to relieve pressure. Manual ventilation provides temporary respiratory support until definitive treatment.",

Propofol, a sedative with vasodilatory effects, can further decrease blood pressure in a hypotensive patient. Delaying treatment for a chest x-ray is unacceptable in this emergency; clinical diagnosis guides immediate action. \n\n*   **Increasing PEEP:** This is a lethal action. It will worsen the tension pneumothorax. \n*   **Continuing Propofol:** This will further drop the blood pressure. \n*   **Waiting for Chest X-Ray:** This delays life-saving treatment.",
