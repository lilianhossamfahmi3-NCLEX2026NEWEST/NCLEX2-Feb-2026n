A continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate is infusing peripherally. The client has a history of a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with her last pregnancy. She reports inconsistent prenatal care due to relying on family for transportation. \n\n**Current Note:** Client suddenly reports intense, constant 10/10 abdominal pain that she describes as 'a tearing feeling.' Uterus is rigid and tender to palpation between contractions. Moderate amount of dark red vaginal bleeding noted. Fetal heart rate tracing shows persistent late decelerations with minimal variability. Provider at bedside, notified of findings. Emergency Cesarean section is being prepared. STAT labs drawn."

The client's laboratory results show profound thrombocytopenia (platelets 68,000), hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen 95), a massively elevated D-dimer (>5,000), and prolonged clotting times (PT/aPTT).
