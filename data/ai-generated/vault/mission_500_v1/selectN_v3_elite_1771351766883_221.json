    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from all exhibits to identify the cluster of life-threatening conditions associated with HELLP syndrome and recognize an absolutely contraindicated medication order. The critical findings requiring immediate intervention are the severe thrombocytopenia (Platelets 45,000/mm³), which poses a massive hemorrhage risk; the severe epigastric pain, which signals liver capsule distention and risk of imminent rupture; the severely elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which indicates a hypertensive crisis and high risk of seizure or stroke; and the order for Ketorolac, an NSAID. Administering an NSAID to a client with severe thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, and kidney injury is a catastrophic error that would block platelet aggregation, worsen bleeding risk, and exacerbate renal failure. This is a classic 'Safety Stop' scenario where the nurse must not proceed with the unsafe order and must intervene immediately to protect the client.",
    "incorrect": "The continuous infusion of Magnesium Sulfate is the correct, standard-of-care treatment for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome; stopping this would be a nursing error. While the client's report of limited prenatal care is a critical social determinant of health (SDOH) that likely contributed to the late diagnosis and severity of the disease, it is not an acute physiological finding requiring immediate intervention in the same tier as impending liver rupture, hypertensive crisis, or a contraindicated medication order. Addressing the SDOH is crucial for systems improvement and discharge planning but does not take priority over immediate life-saving actions.",

        "justification": "**Correct:** This value represents severe thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm³), a hallmark of HELLP syndrome. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** In HELLP syndrome, endothelial damage and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia lead to platelet consumption and decreased platelet production. This results in a critically low platelet count, increasing the risk of spontaneous bleeding.\n\n**Clinical Significance:** A platelet count of 45,000/mm³ places the client at an extremely high risk for spontaneous hemorrhage, including intracranial bleeding, liver hematoma, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is a critical lab value that requires immediate notification of the provider and preparation for potential platelet transfusion."

        "justification": "**Correct:** Severe epigastric or right upper quadrant pain in HELLP syndrome is caused by stretching of the liver capsule (Glisson's capsule) due to hepatocellular necrosis and hemorrhage.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** HELLP syndrome causes fibrin deposition in the liver sinusoids, leading to hepatocellular necrosis, edema, and hemorrhage. This results in distention of the Glisson's capsule, causing severe pain.\n\n**Clinical Significance:** This is a cardinal sign of impending, life-threatening liver rupture. This symptom must be addressed immediately as a medical emergency. The nurse should anticipate orders for imaging studies (e.g., CT scan) and potential transfer to a higher level of care."

        "justification": "**Correct:** This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' moment. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits platelet aggregation.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are essential for the production of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator. By inhibiting platelet aggregation, NSAIDs increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n**Clinical Significance:** Administering Ketorolac to a client with a platelet count of 45,000/mm³ is absolutely contraindicated and would critically increase the risk of severe, uncontrolled bleeding. It is also nephrotoxic and contraindicated in clients with acute kidney injury (Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). The nurse must withhold this medication and question the order immediately. This is a critical safety intervention."

        "justification": "**Correct:** This blood pressure reading constitutes a hypertensive crisis.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** In severe preeclampsia, widespread endothelial dysfunction leads to vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in severely elevated blood pressure.\n\n**Clinical Significance:** This puts the client at immediate risk for an eclamptic seizure, cerebral hemorrhage (stroke), placental abruption, and irreversible organ damage. The nurse must intervene immediately by administering an ordered PRN antihypertensive like Labetalol and notifying the provider. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and neurological status is essential."

The nurse should ensure this infusion is correct and ongoing, not intervene to stop it. Monitor for signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., decreased respiratory rate, absent reflexes)."

        "justification": "**Incorrect:** This is an important health equity/SDOH finding that provides context for the client's severe presentation.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Lack of access to prenatal care can lead to delayed diagnosis and management of pregnancy complications, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes.\n\n**Clinical Significance:** It is crucial for understanding the client's background and for future care coordination. However, it is not an acute physiological derangement requiring immediate clinical intervention to prevent death or disability in this moment. The physiological crises take priority. The nurse should collaborate with social work to address the client's access to care needs."
