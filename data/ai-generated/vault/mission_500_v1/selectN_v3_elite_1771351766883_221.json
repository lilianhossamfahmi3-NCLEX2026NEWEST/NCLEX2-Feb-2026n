        "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from all exhibits to identify the cluster of life-threatening conditions associated with HELLP syndrome and recognize an absolutely contraindicated medication order. The critical findings requiring immediate intervention are the severe thrombocytopenia (Platelets 45,000/mm³), which poses a massive hemorrhage risk; the severe epigastric pain, which signals liver capsule distention and risk of imminent rupture; the severely elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which indicates a hypertensive crisis and high risk of seizure or stroke; and the order for Ketorolac, an NSAID. Administering an NSAID to a client with severe thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, and kidney injury is a catastrophic error that would block platelet aggregation, worsen bleeding risk, and exacerbate renal failure. This is a classic 'Safety Stop' scenario where the nurse must not proceed with the unsafe order and must intervene immediately to protect the client.",
        "incorrect": "The continuous infusion of Magnesium Sulfate is the correct, standard-of-care treatment for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome; stopping this would be a nursing error. While the client's report of limited prenatal care is a critical social determinant of health (SDOH) that likely contributed to the late diagnosis and severity of the disease, it is not an acute physiological finding requiring immediate intervention in the same tier as impending liver rupture, hypertensive crisis, or a contraindicated medication order. Addressing the SDOH is crucial for systems improvement and discharge planning but does not take priority over immediate life-saving actions.",

It places the client at an extremely high risk for spontaneous hemorrhage, including intracranial bleeding, liver hematoma, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is a critical lab value that requires immediate notification of the provider and preparation for potential platelet transfusion."

Administering it to a client with a platelet count of 45,000/mm³ is absolutely contraindicated and would critically increase the risk of severe, uncontrolled bleeding. It is also nephrotoxic and contraindicated in clients with acute kidney injury (Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). The nurse must withhold this medication and question the order immediately."
