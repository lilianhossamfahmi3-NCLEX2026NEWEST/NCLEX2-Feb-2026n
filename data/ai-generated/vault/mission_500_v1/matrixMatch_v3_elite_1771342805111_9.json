Today she's been so agitated, confused, and sweaty.' The client is currently shouting incoherently and rates her generalized body pain as '10/10'.",

This is a life-threatening medical emergency. The priority nursing actions are to immediately stop all serotonergic agents, provide aggressive supportive care to manage hyperthermia and agitation, and anticipate complications like respiratory failure. Administering another serotonergic agent like tramadol would be catastrophic.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the classic triad of Serotonin Syndrome and the serotonergic properties of the client's medications places the client at extreme risk. Administering tramadol would worsen the syndrome, potentially leading to seizures, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, and death. Delaying cooling for severe hyperthermia can result in permanent brain damage and multi-organ failure. A palliative care consult is inappropriate and delays life-saving interventions in an acute crisis.",
