      "optionId": "opt_01",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "This is the correct and highest priority action. The client is exhibiting clear signs of lithium toxicity: a toxic serum level (1.6 mEq/L), neurological symptoms (confusion, coarse tremors), nausea, and cardiotoxicity (QTc prolongation). The toxicity is exacerbated by an acute kidney injury (creatinine 2.8 mg/dL, BUN 45 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (132 mEq/L), which severely impair lithium clearance. Administering another dose would be life-threatening. This is a critical 'safety stop' action. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys. CKD reduces renal clearance, leading to increased serum lithium levels. Hyponatremia causes the kidneys to reabsorb more lithium, further elevating serum levels. Elevated lithium disrupts neuronal ion transport, causing neurological symptoms. Cardiotoxicity results from lithium's interference with cardiac ion channels, prolonging repolarization (QTc prolongation).\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early signs of lithium toxicity can be subtle and easily missed. Always correlate lithium levels with clinical presentation and renal function. Be especially vigilant in patients with CKD or those taking medications that affect sodium balance."

    {
      "optionId": "opt_02",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "This action is incorrect and potentially harmful. The client's vital signs show a trend towards hypotension (102/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (108/min), indicative of developing sepsis or shock. Administering lisinopril, an antihypertensive, would likely worsen the hypotension and further decrease renal perfusion, which would exacerbate both the acute kidney injury and the lithium toxicity. While holding this medication is also appropriate, withholding the lithium is the primary priority as it is the source of the acute toxicity.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that lowers blood pressure by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. In a patient with hypotension and potential sepsis, further reducing blood pressure can compromise organ perfusion, especially to the kidneys, worsening AKI.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess trends in vital signs and consider the overall clinical picture before administering antihypertensive medications. Hypotension in the setting of infection should raise suspicion for sepsis."

      "optionId": "opt_03",

      "rationale": "While the client's nausea should be managed, it is a symptom of the underlying lithium toxicity. Treating a symptom without addressing the life-threatening root cause is incorrect prioritization. The priority must be to stop the toxic exposure and report the critical findings to the provider. Symptom management can be addressed after the life-threatening condition is managed.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Nausea is a common symptom of lithium toxicity, resulting from the drug's effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. While antiemetics can provide symptomatic relief, they do not address the underlying cause of the toxicity.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In cases of suspected drug toxicity, focus on identifying and eliminating the source of the toxin before addressing individual symptoms."

      "optionId": "opt_04",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Implementing fall precautions is a necessary safety intervention due to the client's confusion and tremors. However, this is a supportive action that addresses a risk, not the underlying physiological cause of the symptoms. The priority is to take action that directly mitigates the life-threatening drug toxicity, which is to withhold the medication and escalate care.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Confusion and tremors are neurological manifestations of lithium toxicity, resulting from the drug's effects on neuronal function. These symptoms increase the risk of falls.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** While safety measures like fall precautions are important, they should not take precedence over addressing the underlying cause of neurological symptoms, especially in the context of potential drug toxicity."

  "explanation": "The nurse must synthesize multiple data points to identify a life-threatening condition. The combination of a toxic lithium level (1.6 mEq/L), deteriorating renal function (BUN 45, Cr 2.8), hyponatremia (132 mEq/L), worsening neurological status (confusion, coarse tremors), and signs of cardiotoxicity on the ECG (QTc 510 ms) indicates severe lithium toxicity. The absolute priority is to prevent further harm by withholding the scheduled dose of lithium and immediately notifying the provider of the critical assessment findings. All other actions are secondary to stopping the toxic insult.",
