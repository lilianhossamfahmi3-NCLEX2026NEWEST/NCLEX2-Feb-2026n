Administering lisinopril, an antihypertensive, would likely worsen the hypotension and further decrease renal perfusion, which would exacerbate both the acute kidney injury and the lithium toxicity.

The combination of a toxic lithium level (1.6 mEq/L), deteriorating renal function (BUN 45, Cr 2.8), hyponatremia (132 mEq/L), worsening neurological status (confusion, coarse tremors), and signs of cardiotoxicity on the ECG (QTc 510 ms) indicates severe lithium toxicity. The absolute priority is to prevent further harm by withholding the scheduled dose of lithium and immediately notifying the provider of the critical assessment findings. All other actions are secondary to stopping the toxic insult."
