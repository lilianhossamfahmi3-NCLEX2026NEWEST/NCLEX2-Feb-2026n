    "row1_col1": "Correct. The client exhibits Cushing's Triad (widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, irregular respirations) and the head CT reveals a large hemorrhage with midline shift and herniation, indicating critically high intracranial pressure (ICP). Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is indicated to rapidly decrease ICP by drawing fluid from the cerebral tissue into the vasculature, reducing cerebral edema. The osmotic effect is achieved by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and the brain, causing water to move from the brain tissue into the blood vessels, thereby reducing ICP.",
    "row2_col2": "Correct. This is a critical safety consideration. 0.45% Sodium Chloride is a hypotonic solution. Administering a hypotonic fluid would decrease the serum osmolality, causing fluid to shift from the intravascular space into the brain cells, exacerbating cerebral edema, increasing ICP, and potentially accelerating brain herniation. In patients with increased ICP, hypotonic solutions are strictly contraindicated due to the risk of worsening cerebral edema and neurological deterioration.",
    "row3_col1": "Correct. The client exhibits signs of brainstem compression, including decreasing and irregular respirations (RR 12) and decreasing oxygen saturation (SpO2 93%). The increasing drowsiness indicates a declining level of consciousness. These findings suggest the client is losing the ability to protect their airway and maintain adequate ventilation. Proactive intubation is indicated to secure the airway, control ventilation, and manage CO2 levels. Hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilation, increasing cerebral blood volume and ICP. Controlled ventilation allows for precise management of PaCO2, preventing further increases in ICP.",
    "row4_col2": "Correct. While the client is agitated, this is likely secondary to the high ICP and hypoxia. Administering a benzodiazepine like lorazepam is contraindicated because it can mask crucial neurological changes (e.g., further decline in GCS, pupil changes) and cause respiratory depression, which is already evident. Benzodiazepines can further compromise respiratory function, leading to increased PaCO2 and subsequent cerebral vasodilation, exacerbating ICP. Addressing the underlying cause (ICP) is the priority.",
    "row5_col1": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees with the head in a neutral, midline position is a standard, non-pharmacological nursing intervention to lower ICP. This position promotes venous drainage from the brain, reducing cerebral blood volume and ICP, without significantly compromising cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The semi-Fowler's position facilitates venous outflow, decreasing the hydrostatic pressure within the cerebral vasculature.",
    "row6_col2": "Correct. Deep suctioning induces coughing and can trigger a Valsalva-like maneuver, which dramatically increases intrathoracic pressure and, consequently, intracranial pressure. In a client with critically high ICP and evidence of herniation, this action could precipitate a fatal neurological event. The transient increase in ICP during suctioning can compromise cerebral perfusion and exacerbate neurological damage. It is contraindicated unless there is a clear, life-threatening airway obstruction that cannot be managed otherwise."

    "situation": "58-year-old male admitted for hypertensive crisis with a large right-sided intracerebral hemorrhage, significant mass effect, 7mm midline shift, and early uncal herniation. The client presents with Cushing's Triad.",
    "background": "The client has a history of hypertension and ran out of lisinopril one week ago. On admission, the client reported a sudden, severe headache (10/10) and photophobia. He vomited once and has become increasingly drowsy and intermittently agitated.",
    "assessment": "Current vital signs at 1500 show a blood pressure of 240/100 mmHg, heart rate of 54 bpm, respiratory rate of 12/min (irregular), and SpO2 of 93% on room air. The client is showing signs of brainstem compression and declining level of consciousness. GCS is trending down. Pupils are sluggish to respond to light.",
    "recommendation": "STAT orders include Mannitol 1 g/kg IV, Labetalol 10 mg IV push PRN for SBP > 180 mmHg, 0.45% Sodium Chloride at 75 mL/hr, Lorazepam 1 mg IV push PRN for agitation, and Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO PRN for headache. Recommend immediate administration of Mannitol, preparation for intubation, elevation of the head of the bed, and close monitoring of neurological status. Contraindicated is the 0.45% Sodium Chloride IV infusion and Lorazepam. Consider Labetalol if SBP remains elevated after Mannitol administration. Notify neurosurgery for possible surgical intervention."

    "Hypotonic solutions (e.g., 0.45% NaCl) are contraindicated in patients with increased ICP as they can worsen cerebral edema. Use isotonic solutions like 0.9% NaCl if IV fluids are necessary.",
    "Avoid deep suctioning in patients with increased ICP unless absolutely necessary, as it can significantly increase ICP. Preoxygenate before suctioning and limit suctioning passes to minimize ICP elevation.",
    "Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage and reduce ICP. Ensure the head is in a neutral position to avoid jugular vein compression.",
    "Prioritize treating the underlying cause of agitation (e.g., hypoxia, increased ICP) rather than administering sedatives that can mask neurological changes. If sedation is necessary, use short-acting agents and closely monitor respiratory status.",
    "Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) within the target range (typically 60-70 mmHg) to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain. CPP = MAP - ICP.",
    "Monitor for signs of uncal herniation, including pupillary changes (ipsilateral dilation), altered level of consciousness, and motor deficits.",
    "Consider the use of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) as an alternative to mannitol for ICP reduction, especially in patients with hypotension.",
