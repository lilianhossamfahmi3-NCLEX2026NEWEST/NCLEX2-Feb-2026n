    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. This condition occurs when air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, causing a progressive build-up of pressure within the pleural space. This increased intrathoracic pressure compresses the ipsilateral (same side) lung, shifts the mediastinum to the contralateral (opposite) side, and critically obstructs venous return to the heart, leading to obstructive shock. The decreased venous return reduces preload, cardiac output, and ultimately, blood pressure. The correct nursing response involves recognizing this emergency, initiating immediate life-saving actions to relieve the pressure, and withholding any intervention that could worsen the client's hemodynamic collapse.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindications is a critical safety error. Administering metoprolol would block the body's essential compensatory tachycardia, leading to profound bradycardia and cardiovascular collapse. The body is attempting to compensate for decreased cardiac output by increasing heart rate; blocking this compensatory mechanism is detrimental. Administering morphine would cause respiratory depression and vasodilation, worsening both hypoxia and hypotension. Delaying care to perform non-essential tasks like an ECG could be fatal, as the priority is to relieve the pressure in the chest.",

        "label": "Administer scheduled IV metoprolol.",
        "content": "This action is **Contraindicated**. The client is in obstructive shock, evidenced by profound hypotension (84/52) and severe compensatory tachycardia (HR 148). Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would decrease heart rate and contractility, eliminating the body's only compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. In tension pneumothorax, the decreased venous return leads to decreased cardiac output, and the body compensates by increasing heart rate. Administering this medication would likely cause immediate cardiovascular collapse.",

        "content": "This action is **Indicated**. Needle decompression is the emergent, life-saving intervention for a tension pneumothorax. A large-bore (e.g., 14-gauge) needle is inserted into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to release the trapped air and pressure. The nurse must anticipate this order and prepare the necessary equipment (large-bore needle, antiseptic) while the provider/RRT is being summoned. This is a top priority action.",

        "label": "Administer IV morphine for reported anxiety.",
        "content": "This action is **Contraindicated**. While the client is anxious, the anxiety is a result of severe hypoxia and air hunger. Morphine is an opioid that causes respiratory depression and vasodilation. Respiratory depression will further decrease oxygenation, and vasodilation will worsen hypotension. Administering it would worsen the client's already critical respiratory status (RR 38, SpO2 86%) and exacerbate the severe hypotension (BP 84/52).",

A quick assessment for kinks, clamps, or blockages is a critical, immediate nursing action that could potentially resolve the issue without further invasive procedures. While needle decompression is the priority, addressing a potential chest tube malfunction is also crucial.",

While the client has extreme tachycardia and hemodynamic instability which can cause ECG changes (e.g., electrical alternans, ST changes), the diagnosis is clearly a tension pneumothorax based on the physical exam and CXR. Performing an ECG is not the priority and would waste critical time, delaying the life-saving decompression of the chest. The focus should be on immediate intervention to relieve the pressure.",
