        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. This condition occurs when air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, causing a progressive build-up of pressure. This increased intrathoracic pressure compresses the lung, shifts the mediastinum, and critically obstructs venous return to the heart (obstructive shock). The correct nursing response involves recognizing this emergency, initiating immediate life-saving actions, and withholding any intervention that could worsen the client's hemodynamic collapse.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindications is a critical safety error. Administering metoprolol would block the body's essential compensatory tachycardia, leading to profound bradycardia and cardiovascular collapse. Administering morphine would cause respiratory depression and vasodilation, worsening both hypoxia and hypotension. Delaying care to perform non-essential tasks like an ECG could be fatal, as the priority is to relieve the pressure in the chest.",
