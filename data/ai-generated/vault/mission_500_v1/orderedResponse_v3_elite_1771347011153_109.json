NMS is a reaction to antipsychotic medication, in this case, haloperidol. The priority of actions must focus on stopping the causative agent, stabilizing life-threatening symptoms (hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis), and then escalating care.\n\n1. **Withhold Haloperidol:** This is the absolute first priority. Continuing to administer the offending agent is a critical safety error that will worsen the syndrome. This action removes the primary insult.\n2. **Initiate Cooling Measures:** Extreme hyperthermia (40.1°C) is a direct threat to life and can cause irreversible brain damage. This is an immediate, independent nursing action to stabilize the client.\n3. **Administer IV Fluids:** The massive CK elevation indicates severe rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin released from damaged muscles is nephrotoxic and can cause acute kidney injury, as suggested by the rising creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). Aggressive hydration is critical to flush the myoglobin and protect the kidneys.\n4. **Place on Cardiac Monitor:** Autonomic instability, hyperkalemia (5.4 mEq/L) from rhabdomyolysis, and physiologic stress put the client at high risk for fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring is essential for safety.\n5. **Notify HCP:** After initiating immediate life-saving interventions, the nurse must urgently communicate the findings to the HCP to obtain orders for specific treatments (like dantrolene) and likely transfer to the ICU.\n6. **Prepare Dantrolene:** This is a dependent nursing action. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant used to treat NMS, but it requires an HCP order. The nurse anticipates this order and prepares, but this action cannot precede notifying the provider.",
