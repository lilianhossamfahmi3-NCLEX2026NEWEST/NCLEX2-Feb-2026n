      "correct": "The client's presentation of hyperthermia (40.1°C), autonomic instability (tachycardia, tachypnea, labile BP), 'lead pipe' rigidity, and altered mental status, combined with a massively elevated Creatine Kinase (25,000 U/L), is consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening emergency caused by an adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The pathophysiology involves dopamine blockade in the basal ganglia and hypothalamus, leading to muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. Muscle cell damage releases creatine kinase, leading to rhabdomyolysis and potential kidney injury. The priority of actions must focus on stopping the causative agent, stabilizing life-threatening symptoms (hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis), and then escalating care.\n\n1. **Withhold Haloperidol:** This is the absolute first priority. Continuing to administer the offending agent is a critical safety error that will worsen the syndrome. This action removes the primary insult, preventing further dopamine blockade and muscle damage.\n2. **Initiate Cooling Measures:** Extreme hyperthermia (40.1°C) is a direct threat to life and can cause irreversible brain damage. The elevated temperature results from hypothalamic dysfunction. Rapid cooling prevents cellular damage and reduces metabolic demand.\n3. **Administer IV Fluids:** The massive CK elevation indicates severe rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin released from damaged muscles is nephrotoxic and can cause acute kidney injury, as suggested by the rising creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). Aggressive hydration is critical to flush the myoglobin and protect the kidneys, maintaining adequate renal perfusion and preventing tubular obstruction.\n4. **Place on Cardiac Monitor:** Autonomic instability, hyperkalemia (5.4 mEq/L) from rhabdomyolysis, and physiologic stress put the client at high risk for fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia can disrupt cardiac conduction, leading to arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring is essential for early detection and intervention.\n5. **Notify HCP:** After initiating immediate life-saving interventions, the nurse must urgently communicate the findings to the HCP to obtain orders for specific treatments (like dantrolene) and likely transfer to the ICU. This ensures timely medical management and access to specialized care.\n6. **Prepare Dantrolene:** This is a dependent nursing action. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant used to treat NMS by directly acting on the ryanodine receptor to reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby decreasing muscle rigidity and heat production. It requires an HCP order. The nurse anticipates this order and prepares, but this action cannot precede notifying the provider.",

          "justification": "This is the 'SAFETY STOP' action and the highest priority. NMS is caused by the antipsychotic medication. Failing to withhold the next dose directly contributes to the life-threatening pathophysiology and is a major contraindication. The continued dopamine blockade will exacerbate muscle rigidity and hyperthermia."

          "justification": "While urgent, communication with the HCP occurs after the nurse has initiated immediate, independent actions to stabilize the client. A structured SBAR report is needed to obtain further orders (e.g., dantrolene, ICU transfer) and collaborate on the plan of care. Use the following SBAR framework:\n\n*   **Situation:** The client is a 45-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia admitted for acute agitation who is now exhibiting signs and symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).\n*   **Background:** The client was recently discharged from an inpatient psychiatric facility and has been struggling to take his new medications at the group home. He is currently receiving haloperidol 10 mg IM q6h, with the next dose due now.\n*   **Assessment:** The client is diaphoretic, minimally responsive, and confused. Vital signs include a temperature of 40.1°C, heart rate of 138 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 168/102 mmHg. He exhibits 'lead pipe' rigidity in all four extremities. Lab results show a potassium of 5.4 mEq/L, Creatine Kinase of 25,000 U/L, WBC count of 18.5 x 10³/µL, and creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL.\n*   **Recommendation:** I recommend that the haloperidol be immediately discontinued, and that we obtain orders for dantrolene and transfer the client to the ICU for further management. I have already withheld the haloperidol, initiated cooling measures, started a 1L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride, and placed the client on a continuous cardiac monitor."
