Insulin drives potassium into the cells, which would exacerbate the existing critical hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) and could precipitate a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. The ECG findings (flattened T waves, prominent U waves, ST depression) are classic manifestations of severe hypokalemia and confirm the immediate risk to the client.

Administering insulin will shift potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, worsening the hypokalemia and placing the client at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. It is a standard of care to ensure the serum potassium is at least 3.3 mEq/L before initiating an insulin infusion. This is a critical safety stop.",
