  "rationale": "In Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS), the primary concern is severe dehydration and hyperglycemia. Insulin is crucial for reducing blood glucose, but administering it with a critically low potassium level (2.4 mEq/L) can be fatal. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, further depleting serum potassium and increasing the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The ECG changes (flattened T waves, prominent U waves, ST depression) strongly suggest hypokalemia. Therefore, the priority is to withhold insulin, immediately notify the provider about the critical potassium level, and advocate for a more aggressive potassium replacement to stabilize cardiac function before initiating insulin therapy. Failure to address hypokalemia before insulin administration can lead to rapid deterioration and cardiac arrest.",

      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "justification": "Correct. The client's potassium level of 2.4 mEq/L is critically low (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Insulin administration promotes potassium uptake into cells, potentially worsening hypokalemia and leading to cardiac dysrhythmias or arrest. Current guidelines recommend a potassium level above 3.3 mEq/L before initiating insulin therapy. Withholding insulin is crucial for patient safety.",
