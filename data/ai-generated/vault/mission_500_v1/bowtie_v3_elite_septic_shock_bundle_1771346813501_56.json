His daughter, who provides his transportation, reports he has been increasingly lethargic and confused for the past 24 hours. She lives an hour away and was unable to check on him sooner. On assessment, the client is difficult to arouse but oriented to person only. Skin is cool and clammy. A foul-smelling, purulent, necrotic ulcer is noted on the plantar surface of the right great toe. The client was unaware of the wound's severity due to his neuropathy."
