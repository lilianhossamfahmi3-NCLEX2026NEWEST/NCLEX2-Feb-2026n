The client's platelet count is 45,000/mm³, which is severe thrombocytopenia. Administering a heparin bolus and infusion, a potent anticoagulant, to a client with this level of thrombocytopenia poses an extremely high risk of spontaneous and catastrophic bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. This risk is further magnified by the client's recent fall with a head strike. The nurse must act as a safety barrier, withhold the medication, and immediately communicate the critical lab value and associated risks to the healthcare provider.",

Blindly following the heparin order would be a serious medication error. While oxygenation and IV access are important components of care for a PE, they are not the immediate priority when the nurse is about to administer a medication that is strongly contraindicated and could cause fatal bleeding.",

The risk of severe bleeding outweighs the benefit of treating the PE until the thrombocytopenia can be addressed or an alternative plan (e.g., IVC filter) is considered. The recent head trauma further increases the risk of a fatal intracranial bleed.",
