The nurse must act as a safety barrier and communicate the critical lab value to the provider.",

The risk of severe bleeding outweighs the benefit of treating the PE until the thrombocytopenia is addressed. The recent head trauma further increases the risk of a fatal intracranial bleed. **Pathophysiology:** Heparin inhibits thrombin and other clotting factors. In thrombocytopenia, the reduced platelet count impairs the body's ability to form clots, increasing bleeding risk. **Clinical Pearl:** Always check platelet counts before administering heparin or other anticoagulants.",

The imminent danger is the administration of the contraindicated heparin. **Pathophysiology:** Pulmonary embolism impairs gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia.

However, addressing the underlying cause and preventing further complications is paramount. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor SpO2 and respiratory status closely in PE patients, but prioritize addressing critical contraindications to treatment.",
