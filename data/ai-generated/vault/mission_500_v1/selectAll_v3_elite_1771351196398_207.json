The correct actions are to immediately support hemodynamics, escalate care by notifying the provider, and address life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. Increasing the norepinephrine infusion is indicated to raise the dangerously low blood pressure (MAP is 67 mmHg but trending down rapidly) and improve organ perfusion. Notifying the provider/RRT is a critical safety action as the client's condition is deteriorating rapidly and requires urgent intervention, possibly including mechanical circulatory support. Requesting orders for emergent hyperkalemia treatment is vital, as a potassium of 5.8 mEq/L in the setting of myocardial injury and acute kidney injury poses an immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect actions are those that would be unsafe, contraindicated, or would worsen the client's shock state. Administering metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would be catastrophic as its negative inotropic and chronotropic effects would further decrease cardiac output, heart rate, and blood pressure. Administering furosemide, a potent diuretic, is contraindicated in this hemodynamically unstable state; while the client has pulmonary edema, reducing preload with a diuretic before stabilizing blood pressure will worsen hypotension and renal perfusion. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure by decreasing venous return (preload) and should be avoided in severe hypotension.",

The potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L is a life-threatening emergency, especially in a client with ongoing myocardial ischemia and renal failure. Hyperkalemia can cause fatal dysrhythmias.
