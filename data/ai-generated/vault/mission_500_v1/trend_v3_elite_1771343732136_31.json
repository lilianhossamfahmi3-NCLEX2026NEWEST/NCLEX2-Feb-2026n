The trending data shows a rapid decline with worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension (indicating shock), and severe hypoxemia (SpO2 87%, PaO2 58 mmHg). The chest x-ray confirms ARDS. The thrombocytopenia and anemia are also characteristic. The immediate priority is to address the life-threatening hypoxia and escalate care. Applying a non-rebreather mask, placing the client in high-Fowler's to maximize ventilation, and activating the RRT are the critical first steps.",
        "incorrect": "Administering lorazepam is a life-threatening error. The client's agitation is a direct result of cerebral hypoxia, not anxiety. A benzodiazepine would suppress the client's already compromised respiratory drive, mask further neurological decline, and could precipitate respiratory arrest. Preparing for heparin is incorrect as anticoagulation is not the primary treatment for FES and can be dangerous given the client's significant thrombocytopenia. Inserting a urinary catheter is not the immediate life-saving priority; airway and breathing are paramount.",

The client's agitation and confusion are hallmark neurological symptoms of FES, caused by cerebral hypoxia from fat globules occluding cerebral microvasculature. Administering a sedative would depress the central nervous and respiratory systems, worsening hypoventilation, masking the primary sign of decompensation, and potentially leading to respiratory arrest.

A non-rebreather mask delivers the highest possible concentration of oxygen via a low-flow device and is the essential first step to correct life-threatening hypoxemia while awaiting further intervention like mechanical ventilation.
