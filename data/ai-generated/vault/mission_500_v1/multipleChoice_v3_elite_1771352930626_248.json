The ECG confirms the cardiac impact of this hyperkalemia with tall, peaked T-waves, which are a precursor to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby reducing aldosterone secretion. In a client already experiencing hyperkalemia due to a lack of aldosterone (the primary pathophysiology of adrenal crisis), administering an ACE inhibitor would dangerously exacerbate potassium retention. This action constitutes a critical safety risk that could precipitate a fatal arrhythmia. Therefore, the nurse's priority independent action is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider to have the order discontinued. This is a classic 'SAFETY STOP' scenario where the nurse must prevent iatrogenic harm.",
