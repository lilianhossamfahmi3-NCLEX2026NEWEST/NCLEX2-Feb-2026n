On assessment, breath sounds are diminished on the right side, which is unchanged from the morning assessment. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted around the chest tube insertion site, slightly increased from 4 hours ago. The chest tube dressing is dry and intact. The water seal chamber, which previously had intermittent bubbling with coughing, now has a new onset of vigorous, continuous bubbling. Drainage in the collection chamber is 50 mL of serosanguinous fluid over the past 4 hours."
