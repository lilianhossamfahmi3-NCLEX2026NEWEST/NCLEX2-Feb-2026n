Right-sided chest tube placed in ED for pneumothorax; connected to -20 cm H2O suction with gentle tidaling noted in the water seal chamber. Client is alert and oriented x4. Rates right-sided chest pain 7/10. Breath sounds diminished on the right side. Non-productive cough.\n\n**2330 (Current):**\nCalled to room for acute respiratory distress. Client is extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and grabbing at his chest, stating, 'I can't breathe!' Trachea appears to be deviated slightly to the left. Neck veins are distended. No air leak noted in the water seal chamber and tidaling has stopped. Obvious asymmetrical chest wall movement with no breath sounds auscultated on the right side."

The constellation of acute respiratory distress, severe hypotension, sinus tachycardia, jugular venous distention (JVD), tracheal deviation, and absent breath sounds on the affected side indicates obstructive shock. The cessation of tidaling in the chest tube system strongly suggests an occlusion, which is trapping air in the pleural space and causing the build-up of pressure. This pressure compresses the heart and great vessels, impeding venous return and causing cardiovascular collapse. The ABG shows profound hypoxemia and acute respiratory acidosis. The elevated lactate confirms tissue hypoxia due to shock. The nurse's priority actions are to immediately troubleshoot the chest tube, support oxygenation, and prepare for emergent decompression to relieve the pressure. All other actions are either dangerous or delay life-saving care.",
        "incorrect": "Contraindicated actions, such as administering sedatives (lorazepam) or opioids (morphine), would be catastrophic. These medications would further depress the client's already compromised respiratory drive and worsen the profound hypotension, leading to cardiac arrest. Lowering the head of the bed is also contraindicated as it would worsen dyspnea and could increase intracranial pressure due to impaired venous return from the compressed superior vena cava. Non-essential actions, like ordering a STAT chest x-ray, are incorrect because they waste critical time. A tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis that requires immediate intervention, not radiological confirmation, to prevent death.",
