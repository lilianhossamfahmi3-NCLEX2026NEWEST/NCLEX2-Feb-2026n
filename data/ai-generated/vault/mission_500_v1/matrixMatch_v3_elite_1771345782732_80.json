Client states he 'put off' coming to the ED for several hours hoping the pain would subside as he cannot afford to miss work. Right-sided chest tube placed in ED for pneumothorax; connected to -20 cm H2O suction with gentle tidaling noted in the water seal chamber. Client is alert and oriented x4. Rates right-sided chest pain 7/10. Breath sounds diminished on the right side. Non-productive cough.\n\n**2330 (Current):**\nCalled to room for acute respiratory distress. Client is extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and grabbing at his chest, stating, 'I can't breathe!' Trachea appears to be deviated slightly to the left. Neck veins are distended. No air leak noted in the water seal chamber and tidaling has stopped. Obvious asymmetrical chest wall movement with no breath sounds auscultated on the right side."

The key findings include acute respiratory distress, hypotension (BP 85/50), tachycardia (HR 145), jugular venous distention (JVD), tracheal deviation to the left, absent breath sounds on the right side, and a critically low SpO2 of 79%. The cessation of tidaling in the chest tube system suggests an occlusion, trapping air in the pleural space. This trapped air increases pressure, compressing the heart and great vessels, leading to obstructive shock. The ABG reveals severe hypoxemia (PaO2 55 mmHg) and acute respiratory acidosis (pH 7.18, PaCO2 65 mmHg). Elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L) confirms tissue hypoxia. Immediate actions are to assess and correct the chest tube occlusion, maximize oxygenation, and prepare for needle decompression to relieve the pressure. Delaying these interventions can lead to rapid deterioration and death.",
    "incorrect": "Administering sedatives (lorazepam) or opioids (morphine) is contraindicated as they can further depress the respiratory drive and worsen hypotension, potentially leading to respiratory or cardiac arrest. Lowering the head of the bed is also contraindicated as it can exacerbate dyspnea and increase intracranial pressure. Requesting a STAT chest x-ray is non-essential as it delays immediate life-saving interventions. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis requiring immediate treatment, not radiological confirmation.",
