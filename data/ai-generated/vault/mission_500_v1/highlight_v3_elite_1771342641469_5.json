Client states he had intermittent chest pain for 3 days but delayed seeking care due to being the sole caregiver for his spouse. He is currently lethargic but oriented to person and place. Skin is cool and diaphoretic. Bilateral basilar crackles are noted on auscultation. Urine output has decreased to 15 mL/hr for the past 2 hours, and the urine is dark amber. Morning laboratory results have been reviewed and show a potassium of 6.8 mEq/L and a creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL. The client remains on continuous norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions for hemodynamic support."

    "correct": "The most critical finding that requires an immediate safety stop is the laboratory result showing severe hyperkalemia (Potassium 6.8 mEq/L) in the setting of acute kidney injury (Creatinine 2.5 mg/dL). Administering the scheduled spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is absolutely contraindicated. This action would further increase the serum potassium, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. This combination of data represents an imminent threat to the client's life that must be addressed before any other action is taken. The nurse's primary responsibility is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for treating the hyperkalemia.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings, while abnormal and indicative of severe illness, are either expected manifestations of cardiogenic shock or do not represent an immediate contraindication to a scheduled medication. The key is to identify the piece of data that makes a planned nursing action (medication administration) actively harmful and potentially lethal. The severe hyperkalemia coupled with the plan to give a potassium-sparing medication is the clear 'DON'T PROCEED' signal.",

        "justification": "Oliguria (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hr) is a hallmark of cardiogenic shock and indicates acute kidney injury (AKI) due to poor renal perfusion. This finding is directly related to the high creatinine and potassium. However, the specific lab value (K+ of 6.8) is the direct, quantifiable contraindication to the spironolactone, making it the most critical piece of data to act upon. The oliguria is the symptom; the hyperkalemia is the immediately life-threatening chemical imbalance."

        "justification": "This is the correct answer. A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L constitutes severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The elevated creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL confirms AKI, meaning the client cannot excrete potassium effectively. Administering spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, would be a lethal medication error. This finding requires the nurse to STOP, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider for urgent intervention (e.g., insulin/dextrose, calcium gluconate, dialysis)."

It is part of the ongoing, appropriate treatment plan."
