The client's history of heart failure (EF 35%) and extremely elevated BNP (1550 pg/mL) are major red flags. The cues pointing to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and pulmonary edema are overwhelming: worsening tachypnea (RR from 28 to 34), progressive hypoxia (SpO2 from 91% to 88% despite increased O2), the client's statement of 'feeling like I'm drowning,' and the new moist, gurgling cough. While the client's MAP has improved, their respiratory status has critically deteriorated due to fluid overload from the first bolus. The priority is to STOP the intervention causing harm (the fluid bolus) and START an intervention to correct the complication (administering the PRN furosemide to promote diuresis). Monitoring breath sounds for crackles and urine output are the most direct ways to assess the client's response to these interventions.",
