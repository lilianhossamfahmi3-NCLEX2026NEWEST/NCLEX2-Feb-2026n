The client is also experiencing significant complications including hypokalemia and ventricular irritability (NSVT). Nursing actions must prioritize hemodynamic stabilization, correction of life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, and optimization of oxygenation, while strictly avoiding interventions that would worsen cardiac output, blood pressure, or arrhythmic potential.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting contraindicated actions could lead to rapid cardiovascular collapse. Administering furosemide would deplete already inadequate preload, and administering carvedilol would decrease contractility and heart rate, both of which would be catastrophic in this state of shock. Failing to select indicated actions means missing the opportunity to correct life-threatening issues like hypotension, hypokalemia, and hypoxia, leading to further deterioration and potential cardiac arrest.",

Furosemide, a loop diuretic, reduces preload by promoting fluid excretion. In cardiogenic shock, administering a diuretic to a hypotensive patient who is already relatively hypovolemic will further decrease cardiac output and exacerbate the shock state. The client is also hypokalemic (K+ 3.1 mEq/L), and furosemide would worsen this, significantly increasing the risk of a lethal arrhythmia, especially with existing NSVT.",
