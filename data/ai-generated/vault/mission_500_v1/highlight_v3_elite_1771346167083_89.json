    "correct": "The combination of tracheal deviation to the unaffected (left) side, absent breath sounds on the affected (right) side, and distended neck veins are the classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. In a tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrapleural pressure. This increased pressure causes a mediastinal shift, compressing the heart and great vessels, leading to decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. The vital sign trends (1000-1200) confirm this progression: increasing tachycardia (98 to 142 bpm), decreasing blood pressure (124/78 to 88/52 mmHg), increasing respiratory rate (22 to 36 breaths/min), and decreasing oxygen saturation (96% to 87%). The lack of tidaling in the water seal chamber suggests a chest tube occlusion, which can contribute to the development of a tension pneumothorax. Immediate intervention is required to relieve the pressure and restore hemodynamic stability.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the PRN morphine would be a life-threatening error. Opioids cause respiratory depression by decreasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center in the brainstem to carbon dioxide levels, leading to decreased respiratory rate and tidal volume. This would worsen the client's hypoxia and hypercapnia, potentially leading to respiratory arrest. While pain is present, it is a symptom of the underlying emergency; treating the pain is not the priority and would be dangerous.",

The increased pressure in the right pleural space pushes the mediastinum, including the trachea, to the opposite side. This compresses the left lung and further compromises respiratory function.

The increased intrathoracic pressure compresses the superior vena cava, impeding venous return to the heart. This causes blood to back up into the venous system, leading to jugular venous distention. This is a sign of impending cardiovascular collapse.",

Rapid deterioration in vital signs is also a key indicator. Always assess the chest tube system for patency and function. A sudden cessation of tidaling in the water seal chamber, especially with worsening respiratory status, should raise suspicion for a blockage or tension pneumothorax.",
