This is a medical emergency where air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, causing a mediastinal shift that compresses the heart and great vessels. The vital signs trend confirms this progression into obstructive shock (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia). The nurse must recognize these cues as a life-threatening priority over all other findings, such as pain. The lack of tidaling in the chest tube system further suggests an occlusion, which is the likely cause of the tension pneumothorax.",

Opioids cause respiratory depression and can mask changes in the level of consciousness, which would worsen the client's hypoxia and hypotension, hastening cardiovascular collapse.
