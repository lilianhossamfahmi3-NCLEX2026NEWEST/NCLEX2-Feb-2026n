    "correct": "The client's presentation is a classic medical emergency: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic medication (haloperidol). Key features are hyperthermia (40.1°C), autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile BP from hypertensive to hypotensive), altered mental status (confusion), and severe muscle rigidity ('lead-pipe' stiffness). Laboratory results confirm this with extreme rhabdomyolysis (CK 12,500), leukocytosis, and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Creatinine) from myoglobinuria. The first and most critical action is to STOP the offending agent. Continuing haloperidol would worsen the syndrome and likely be fatal. Immediately after, the provider must be notified of the critical situation to get orders for treatment (e.g., dantrolene, bromocriptine) and transfer. Concurrently, the nurse must address the life-threatening hyperthermia with cooling measures and begin supportive care like IV fluids to protect the kidneys from rhabdomyolysis-induced failure. Preparing for ICU transfer is the final step in this immediate sequence.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the haloperidol is the most dangerous action possible and represents a failure to recognize a life-threatening contraindication. Delaying notification of the HCP or failing to initiate cooling measures while waiting for orders would allow the hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis to cause irreversible brain and kidney damage.",

Continuing the offending agent is the most harmful action the nurse could take and violates the core safety principle of 'do no harm'. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action."

The nurse must communicate the critical assessment findings (SBAR format), including the suspicion of NMS. The HCP needs to order specific treatments (e.g., dantrolene) and direct the plan of care. The RT is notified due to the dropping SpO2 (93%), rapid shallow breathing (tachypnea), and potential for chest wall rigidity to compromise ventilation."

This is an independent nursing action that must be started immediately to prevent further organ damage while awaiting HCP orders. This directly treats the most immediate life-threatening symptom."

Myoglobin released from damaged muscle is nephrotoxic and will cause acute renal failure, which is already beginning (elevated BUN/Cr). Aggressive IV hydration is crucial to flush the myoglobin through the kidneys and prevent irreversible damage. This addresses the impending shock state (hypotension) and renal failure."

Care on a psychiatric unit is no longer appropriate or safe. The client requires intensive monitoring, mechanical ventilation support, and advanced pharmacological interventions that can only be provided in an ICU setting. This action anticipates the needs of the client and the orders from the HCP."
