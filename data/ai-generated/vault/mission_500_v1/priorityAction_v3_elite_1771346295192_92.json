The ECG strip showing frequent multifocal PVCs and a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia is a critical finding. Dobutamine, a positive inotrope, works by stimulating beta-1 receptors. While this increases contractility, it also significantly increases myocardial oxygen demand and is known to be arrhythmogenic. Initiating this infusion in a heart that is already electrically unstable poses an immediate and life-threatening risk of precipitating sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This is a \"Don't Proceed\" / \"Safety Stop\" moment. The nurse's absolute priority is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately communicate the critical ECG finding and hemodynamic instability to the provider for a re-evaluation of the treatment plan.",

The client has signs of pulmonary edema (crackles), but the core problem is cardiogenic shock (hypotension, hypoperfusion with high lactate and AKI). Aggressive diuresis with furosemide will reduce preload. In a client who is already profoundly hypotensive, this can further decrease cardiac output and blood pressure, worsening systemic perfusion. The primary issue is pump failure, not fluid volume excess."
