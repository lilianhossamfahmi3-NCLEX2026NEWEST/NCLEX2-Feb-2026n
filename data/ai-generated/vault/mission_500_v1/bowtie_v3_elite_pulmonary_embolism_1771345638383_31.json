The client's presentation of hypotension (BP 94/60 at 1430), tachycardia (HR 134 at 1430), hypoxia (SpO2 86% at 1430), elevated lactate (3.2 mmol/L), elevated creatinine (1.5 mg/dL), and confusion in the context of a confirmed massive pulmonary embolism with right heart strain points to obstructive shock, a subtype of cardiogenic shock. The large embolus obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle, leading to circulatory collapse. Right ventricular strain occurs as the heart attempts to pump against the increased pulmonary vascular resistance. ClinicalPearl: Cardiogenic shock from PE requires rapid intervention to improve cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Consider the underlying cause and contraindications to treatments."

Recent (within 3 months) intracranial or intraspinal surgery, serious head trauma, or presence of an intracranial hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication for alteplase (thrombolytic) therapy due to the high risk of life-threatening bleeding. Alteplase works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. In the presence of a subdural hematoma, this can lead to further bleeding and expansion of the hematoma. Proceeding with the infusion could be fatal. This is a 'SAFETY STOP' moment.
