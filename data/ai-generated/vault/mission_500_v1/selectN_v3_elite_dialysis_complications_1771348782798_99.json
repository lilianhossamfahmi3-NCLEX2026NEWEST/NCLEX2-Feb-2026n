        "correctRationale": "The central safety issue is an active intracranial bleed (subdural hematoma) in a client about to undergo hemodialysis. Standard hemodialysis protocols involve systemic heparinization to prevent clotting in the dialysis circuit. Administering heparin to a client with a subdural hematoma is an absolute contraindication, as it would worsen the bleed, increase intracranial pressure (ICP), and could lead to brain herniation and death. The nurse must recognize the constellation of signs and symptoms of increasing ICP and the definitive diagnostic finding. Withholding the treatment and immediately notifying the provider is the only safe nursing action.",
        "incorrectRationale": "The incorrect options represent expected findings in a client with ESRD and pneumonia. While these conditions (uremia, hyperkalemia, fluid overload) are serious and are the primary indications for dialysis, they do not represent an acute contraindication to the procedure. An effective nurse must differentiate between the problems that dialysis is intended to treat and a new, life-threatening condition that makes the treatment itself unsafe.",

In the context of a recent fall, these neurological changes are highly alarming and suggest an evolving intracranial process, such as the diagnosed subdural hematoma. The nurse must not dismiss these as symptoms of pneumonia."
