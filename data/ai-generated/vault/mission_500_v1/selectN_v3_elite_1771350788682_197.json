    "correct": "The client's condition has deteriorated, suggesting decompensation into cardiogenic shock. The sustained rapid ventricular rate reduces diastolic filling time and cardiac output. The combination of hypotension (BP 92/58 mmHg), hypoperfusion (cool, clammy skin, capillary refill 3 seconds), and tissue hypoxia (lactate 4.2 mmol/L) contraindicates metoprolol administration. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, decreases heart rate and contractility, further lowering blood pressure and cardiac output. The priority is to withhold the medication and notify the healthcare provider immediately. Alternative interventions may include synchronized cardioversion, vasopressors, or alternative antiarrhythmics. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** In cardiogenic shock, the heart's ability to pump blood effectively is compromised, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to insufficient oxygen delivery. Administering a negative inotrope like metoprolol exacerbates the situation by further reducing cardiac output.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting options that describe the underlying condition (atrial fibrillation with RVR) or chronic issues indicates a failure to recognize the emergent contraindication. While tachycardia and irregular rhythm prompted the medication order, hemodynamic instability makes the order unsafe.
