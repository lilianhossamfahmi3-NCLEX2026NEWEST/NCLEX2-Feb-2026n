The combination of significant hypotension (BP 92/58), clinical signs of hypoperfusion (cool, clammy skin), and biochemical evidence of tissue hypoxia (elevated lactate) constitutes an absolute contraindication to administering a beta-blocker like metoprolol. Metoprolol is a negative chronotrope and inotrope, meaning it would further decrease the heart rate and contractility, catastrophically lowering the already dangerously low blood pressure and cardiac output. The nurse's priority is to recognize this life-threatening change, withhold the medication, and advocate for immediate alternative interventions such as synchronized cardioversion, vasopressors, or different antiarrhythmics.",

While tachycardia and an irregular rhythm are the reasons for the medication order, the new onset of hemodynamic instability makes that order unsafe to carry out. The nurse must differentiate between the problem being treated and the new, more dangerous problem that has developed.",
