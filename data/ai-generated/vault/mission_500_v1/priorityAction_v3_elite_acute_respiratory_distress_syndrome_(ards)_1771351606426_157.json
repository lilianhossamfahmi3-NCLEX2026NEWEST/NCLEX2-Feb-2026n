Initial resuscitation included 10L of crystalloids and 4 units of packed red blood cells. Client remains intubated, sedated, and pharmacologically paralyzed. Over the past 4 hours, urine output has decreased to 30-40 mL/hr and is dark amber. Auscultation reveals worsening bilateral crackles, now extending to the mid-lung fields. Increased amounts of pink, frothy secretions noted in the endotracheal tube, requiring suctioning every 30 minutes."

The client has severe ARDS, evidenced by the CXR showing diffuse bilateral opacities, pink frothy sputum (pulmonary edema), and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 68.75 (55/0.80), indicating severe refractory hypoxemia. Administering a large fluid bolus will worsen the pulmonary edema, further impair gas exchange, and exacerbate the shock state. The provider's rationale (AKI) is secondary to the immediate life-threat of respiratory failure."

            "rationale": "Correct. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The nurse must recognize that despite the rising creatinine, the client's primary problem is severe ARDS with profound fluid overload in the pulmonary space. The vital signs trend, physical assessment (worsening crackles, pink frothy sputum), and diagnostic data all confirm this. Withholding the fluid bolus is the first step in preventing further harm."

            "rationale": "Correct. The client is in shock, evidenced by hypotension (BP 95/50), tachycardia (HR 128), and elevated lactate (4.1 mmol/L). In fluid-overloaded ARDS, hypotension is often due to inflammatory mediators and high intrathoracic pressures from mechanical ventilation, not hypovolemia. The correct treatment is vasopressor support (e.g., norepinephrine) to improve mean arterial pressure and perfusion without adding more volume to the lungs. This is a critical recommendation to make when questioning the fluid order."

While diuretics like furosemide are used to achieve a negative fluid balance in ARDS, initiating them in a client who is already hypotensive (BP 95/50) and in shock could cause cardiovascular collapse. Vasopressor support must be initiated first to stabilize hemodynamics before diuresis can be safely considered. Therefore, this is not a priority action at this moment."

The client's ratio is 68.75, making them a prime candidate. This therapy improves ventilation-perfusion matching and recruits collapsed alveoli. The nurse should anticipate this order and begin preparations, as it is a complex, team-based procedure that directly addresses the life-threatening hypoxemia."

            "isCorrect": false,

While increasing PEEP may be necessary to improve oxygenation and recruit alveoli, independently changing ventilator settings is outside the nurse's scope of practice. The nurse's role is to assess, identify the need, and collaborate with the provider and respiratory therapist to determine the appropriate ventilator strategy. The priority actions involve independent nursing judgment (withholding a harmful order) and communication/advocacy."
