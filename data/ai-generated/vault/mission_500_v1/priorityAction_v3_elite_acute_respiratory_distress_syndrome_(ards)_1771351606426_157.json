      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering a 1000 mL bolus of 0.9% Sodium Chloride is contraindicated and potentially life-threatening in this client. The client exhibits clear signs of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), evidenced by the chest X-ray showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, worsening bilateral crackles, and increased amounts of pink, frothy secretions (pulmonary edema). The ABG results reveal a PaO2 of 55 mmHg on an FiO2 of 80%, resulting in a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 68.75, indicating severe refractory hypoxemia.  The underlying pathophysiology of ARDS involves an exaggerated inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability and fluid leakage into the alveoli. This impairs gas exchange, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.  Administering a large fluid bolus will exacerbate the pulmonary edema, further impairing gas exchange and potentially leading to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. The provider's rationale of acute kidney injury (AKI) is secondary to the immediate life-threat of respiratory failure. The AKI is likely prerenal due to hypoperfusion from the shock state.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Fluid boluses are generally contraindicated in ARDS due to the risk of worsening pulmonary edema and impairing gas exchange. Always assess for signs of fluid overload (crackles, edema, jugular venous distension) before administering fluids. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 indicates acute lung injury/ARDS. The lower the ratio, the more severe the ARDS."
    },
    "opt2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The nurse must recognize that despite the rising creatinine, the client's primary problem is severe ARDS with profound fluid overload in the pulmonary space. The vital signs trend (increasing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure), physical assessment (worsening crackles, pink frothy sputum), and diagnostic data (CXR, ABGs) all confirm this. Withholding the fluid bolus is the first step in preventing further harm. The pathophysiology of ARDS involves increased pulmonary capillary permeability, leading to fluid leakage into the alveoli and impaired gas exchange. Administering more fluid will only worsen this process. The nurse is acting as a patient advocate by questioning an order that could cause significant harm.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In situations where a provider's order appears to contradict the client's clinical status, the nurse has a responsibility to question the order and advocate for the client's safety. Always prioritize the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and address the most immediate life-threatening issue first. In this case, it is the respiratory failure caused by ARDS."
    },
    "opt3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is in shock, evidenced by hypotension (BP 95/50), tachycardia (HR 128), and elevated lactate (4.1 mmol/L). The elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate tissue perfusion. In fluid-overloaded ARDS, hypotension is often due to inflammatory mediators causing vasodilation and increased intrathoracic pressures from mechanical ventilation impeding venous return, not hypovolemia. The correct treatment is vasopressor support (e.g., norepinephrine) to improve mean arterial pressure and perfusion without adding more volume to the lungs. Norepinephrine acts primarily on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure. This is a critical recommendation to make when questioning the fluid order.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hypotension in ARDS is often due to vasodilation and increased intrathoracic pressure, not hypovolemia. Vasopressors are often needed to maintain adequate perfusion. Monitor lactate levels to assess the effectiveness of vasopressor therapy. A decreasing lactate level indicates improved tissue perfusion."
    },
    "opt4": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While diuretics like furosemide are used to achieve a negative fluid balance in ARDS and help reduce pulmonary edema, initiating them in a client who is already hypotensive (BP 95/50) and in shock could cause further cardiovascular compromise and potentially lead to cardiovascular collapse. Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased urine output and fluid loss. However, this can also decrease intravascular volume and worsen hypotension. Vasopressor support must be initiated first to stabilize hemodynamics before diuresis can be safely considered. Therefore, this is not a priority action at this moment.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Diuretics should be used cautiously in hypotensive patients, especially those with ARDS. Hemodynamic stability should be achieved first with vasopressors. Monitor blood pressure and urine output closely when administering diuretics."
    },
    "opt5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Prone positioning is a key, evidence-based intervention for severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150). The client's ratio is 68.75, making them a prime candidate. This therapy improves ventilation-perfusion matching and recruits collapsed alveoli. In the prone position, the heart and mediastinum shift anteriorly, reducing pressure on the lungs. This allows for more uniform alveolar inflation and improved gas exchange. Additionally, prone positioning can help drain secretions from the dependent lung regions. The nurse should anticipate this order and begin preparations, as it is a complex, team-based procedure that directly addresses the life-threatening hypoxemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Prone positioning is a highly effective intervention for improving oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS and should be considered early in the course of treatment. Ensure adequate sedation and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate prone positioning. Monitor for complications such as pressure ulcers, dislodgement of lines, and facial edema."
    },
    "opt6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While increasing PEEP may be necessary to improve oxygenation and recruit alveoli, independently changing ventilator settings is outside the nurse's scope of practice. The nurse's role is to assess, identify the need, and collaborate with the provider and respiratory therapist to determine the appropriate ventilator strategy. PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) increases the pressure in the alveoli at the end of expiration, preventing alveolar collapse and improving oxygenation. However, excessive PEEP can lead to barotrauma (lung injury due to excessive pressure) and decreased cardiac output. The priority actions involve independent nursing judgment (withholding a harmful order) and communication/advocacy.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Nurses should collaborate with respiratory therapists and providers to optimize ventilator settings. Independent adjustments to ventilator settings are generally outside the scope of nursing practice. Monitor for signs of barotrauma (pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema) and decreased cardiac output (hypotension, decreased urine output) when using high levels of PEEP."
