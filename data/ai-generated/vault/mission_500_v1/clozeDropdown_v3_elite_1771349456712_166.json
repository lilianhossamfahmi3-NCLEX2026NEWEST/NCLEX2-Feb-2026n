    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from all tabs to identify a life-threatening condition. The client's presentation includes classic signs of lithium toxicity: neurological (confusion, ataxia/unsteadiness, tremor/shakiness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting), and cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension trend, ECG changes). The laboratory results confirm this diagnosis with a lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L, which is severely toxic. The hyponatremia (132 mEq/L), elevated BUN/creatinine, and recent administration of hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) are critical cues, as they all increase lithium reabsorption in the kidneys, precipitating toxicity. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium excretion and a compensatory increase in lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. This interaction significantly elevates the risk of lithium toxicity. The ECG findings of T-wave flattening and a prolonged QTc interval are cardiotoxic effects of lithium, resulting from lithium's interference with cardiac ion channels. Given this overwhelming evidence of severe toxicity, the only safe action is to immediately withhold the next dose of lithium to prevent worsening the condition and promptly notify the provider for further orders, which may include aggressive hydration and/or hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is considered when lithium levels are >4.0 mEq/L or in cases of severe toxicity with renal impairment.",
    "incorrect": "The other diagnoses are less likely based on the full clinical picture. Serotonin syndrome requires a serotonergic agent, which is not present, and typically involves hyperreflexia and clonus. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is caused by antipsychotics and is characterized by high fever and lead-pipe rigidity. While sepsis could cause confusion and tachycardia, it does not explain the specific combination of ataxia, tremor, severe GI distress, toxic lithium level, and characteristic ECG changes. The other actions are unsafe or not the priority. Administering more lithium would be catastrophic. Treating the nausea with an antiemetic ignores the life-threatening cause. Increasing IV fluids is a correct intervention for lithium toxicity but is not the *priority first action*; the nurse must first stop the offending agent and get a provider order to change the fluid rate.",

The constellation of symptoms (neurological, GI), laboratory values (toxic lithium level, AKI, hyponatremia), and ECG changes (QTc prolongation) are hallmark signs of severe lithium toxicity. Lithium toxicity occurs because lithium competes with sodium in the kidneys; when sodium levels are low (due to diuretics or dehydration), the kidneys reabsorb more lithium, leading to increased serum levels."
