This clinical picture suggests cardiogenic shock. Administering diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, would further decrease cardiac contractility and blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' safety stop. Furthermore, the critical hyperkalemia (6.9 mEq/L) is a life-threatening emergency that can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias and must be addressed immediately. Therefore, the nurse's first priority is to withhold the dangerous medication. The second priority is to immediately notify the provider of the client's hemodynamic instability and critical lab values to obtain new orders for stabilizing the client, which may include interventions for hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose) and consideration for electrical cardioversion over pharmacological rate control.",

The client's profound hypotension (BP 84/52) and signs of shock (high lactate, cool/clammy skin) are absolute contraindications to administering diltiazem, which would worsen hemodynamic collapse by decreasing contractility and blood pressure."
