      "opt1_2": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. A cooling blanket is a supportive measure to manage hyperthermia, which is present in this client. However, preventing the administration of a contraindicated medication (aspirin) that will exacerbate the thyroid storm is the immediate priority."

      "opt1_3": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must recognize the contraindication of aspirin (ASA) in thyroid storm. Aspirin increases free thyroid hormone levels by displacing T4 and T3 from thyroid-binding globulin, acutely worsening the thyrotoxic crisis. The nurse's immediate action is to withhold the medication and notify the provider."

      "opt1_4": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Lorazepam addresses the symptom of agitation, which is appropriate. However, the priority is preventing the administration of a contraindicated medication (aspirin) that will directly worsen the underlying pathophysiology of this life-threatening emergency."

      "opt2_2": {
        "isCorrect": false,

Always double-check medication orders against the client's condition and known contraindications. Early recognition and intervention are crucial in managing thyroid storm to prevent life-threatening complications. Remember the mnemonic 'I-THYROID' for thyroid storm management: Iodine, T (PTU or Methimazole), Hydration, Y (Beta Blockers), Oxygen, I (ICU), D (Dexamethasone).",
