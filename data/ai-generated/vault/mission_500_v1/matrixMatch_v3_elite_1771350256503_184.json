This is evidenced by the combination of elevated Troponin I, ECG changes confirming acute myocardial injury, and signs of pump failure (JVD, crackles, worsening hypotension, and falling SpO2) despite ongoing fluid administration. The rising lactate and worsening renal function indicate poor end-organ perfusion due to cardiac pump failure, not just hypovolemia. In this state, continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation as per the Parkland formula is life-threatening as it will precipitate fulminant pulmonary edema and complete cardiovascular collapse. The only safe and indicated action is to immediately stop the planned fluid administration, recognize the life-threatening change, and urgently notify the provider to shift the treatment strategy towards managing cardiogenic shock (e.g., inotropes, vasopressors, and cautious fluid management).",
        "incorrect": "Actions are contraindicated if they worsen the underlying pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock. Continuing fluids or giving a bolus will overwhelm the failing myocardium. Administering a diuretic like furosemide without a definitive order in the context of hypotension is dangerous as it can critically reduce preload and worsen shock. Actions are non-essential if they do not address the most immediate, life-threatening problem. While intubation and a chest x-ray may be needed soon, the critical first step is to recognize the cardiac emergency and stop the harmful intervention (fluids).",
