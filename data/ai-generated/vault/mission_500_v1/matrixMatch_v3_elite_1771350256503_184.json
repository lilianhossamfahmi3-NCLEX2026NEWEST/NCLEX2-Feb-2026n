    "correct": "The client's clinical picture has evolved from hypovolemic/distributive burn shock to a superimposed cardiogenic shock. This is evidenced by the combination of elevated Troponin I, ECG changes confirming acute myocardial injury, and signs of pump failure (JVD, crackles, worsening hypotension, and falling SpO2) despite ongoing fluid administration. The rising lactate and worsening renal function indicate poor end-organ perfusion due to cardiac pump failure, not just hypovolemia. In this state, continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation as per the Parkland formula is life-threatening as it will precipitate fulminant pulmonary edema and complete cardiovascular collapse. The only safe and indicated action is to immediately stop the planned fluid administration, recognize the life-threatening change, and urgently notify the provider to shift the treatment strategy towards managing cardiogenic shock (e.g., inotropes, vasopressors, and cautious fluid management).",
    "incorrect": "Actions are contraindicated if they worsen the underlying pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock. Continuing fluids or giving a bolus will overwhelm the failing myocardium. Administering a diuretic like furosemide without a definitive order in the context of hypotension is dangerous as it can critically reduce preload and worsen shock. Actions are non-essential if they do not address the most immediate, life-threatening problem. While intubation and a chest x-ray may be needed soon, the critical first step is to recognize the cardiac emergency and stop the harmful intervention (fluids).",

        "classification": "Contraindicated",
        "justification": "Continuing fluid resuscitation is contraindicated. The client exhibits signs of cardiogenic shock, including crackles, JVD, hypotension, elevated troponin, and ECG changes. The pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock involves the heart's inability to pump effectively, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. The increased metabolic demands of burn injuries can exacerbate myocardial dysfunction. Administering more fluids to a failing heart increases preload beyond its compensatory ability, leading to severe pulmonary edema and worsening shock."

        "label": "Administer a 500 mL bolus of Lactated Ringer's solution.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "classification": "Contraindicated",
        "justification": "Administering a fluid bolus is extremely dangerous and contraindicated. The rationale is the same as for continuing the infusion. A fluid bolus acutely increases venous return and ventricular filling pressures on a myocardium that is already injured and failing. This causes rapid decompensation, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and further myocardial damage. The failing heart cannot handle the increased volume, leading to a backup of fluid into the pulmonary circulation."

        "label": "Administer furosemide 40 mg IV push as prescribed PRN for edema.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "classification": "Contraindicated",
        "justification": "Administering furosemide is a critical safety stop and is contraindicated. While the client has signs of fluid overload (crackles, JVD), they are also hypotensive (BP 88/68). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, reduces preload by promoting fluid excretion. In cardiogenic shock, preload is already compromised due to the heart's inability to pump effectively. Administering a potent diuretic in this situation can catastrophically decrease preload, causing a profound drop in cardiac output and blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiac arrest. This intervention is unsafe without direct provider evaluation and orders to support blood pressure concurrently."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "classification": "Indicated",
        "justification": "Withholding the fluid rate change and notifying the provider immediately is the priority nursing action and is indicated. The nurse has identified a life-threatening change in the client's condition that invalidates the current treatment plan. The safest and most critical action is to halt the potentially harmful intervention (fluid administration) and immediately communicate the synthesized findings (ECG, troponin, vital signs, physical exam) to the provider for new orders. This allows for a rapid reassessment of the client's condition and implementation of appropriate interventions to manage the cardiogenic shock, such as inotropic support or vasopressors."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "classification": "Non-essential",
        "justification": "Preparing for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is non-essential at this moment. While the client's respiratory status is declining (SpO2 91%, RR 28), and intubation may become necessary, it is not the most immediate priority action. The root cause of the decompensation is cardiac. The priority is to stop harming the heart with fluids and get orders to support cardiac function. Preparing for intubation is anticipatory but secondary to stopping the harmful intervention and escalating care. Addressing the cardiac issue may improve respiratory status, potentially avoiding intubation."

      {
        "label": "Obtain a stat chest x-ray.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "classification": "Non-essential",
        "justification": "Obtaining a stat chest x-ray is non-essential. A chest x-ray would likely confirm pulmonary edema, but it is not the priority action. The nurse already has sufficient data (crackles, JVD, falling SpO2, ECG, troponin) to identify cardiogenic shock. Delaying notification of the provider to obtain another diagnostic test is inappropriate. The diagnosis is clear enough to warrant immediate action. The time spent obtaining the x-ray could delay critical interventions to support cardiac function."
