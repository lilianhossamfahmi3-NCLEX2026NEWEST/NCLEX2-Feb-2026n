Aggressive diuresis for heart failure has likely caused a pre-renal Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), evidenced by the sharp rise in BUN (25 to 78) and Creatinine (1.4 to 3.9). This AKI has led to critical hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L). The ECG confirms cardiotoxicity with peaked T waves, a classic sign. The client is also hemodynamically unstable, with new-onset hypotension (92/58 mmHg) and compensatory tachycardia (118/min). Administering lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is absolutely contraindicated. ACE inhibitors can worsen renal function, increase potassium levels, and cause profound hypotension. The priority and safest action is to 'STOP', withhold the dangerous medication, and immediately escalate care by notifying the provider of the critical findings (AKI, hyperkalemia, ECG changes, and hypotension) to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose).",
