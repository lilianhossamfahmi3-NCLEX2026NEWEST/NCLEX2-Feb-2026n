While fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of treating adrenal crisis-induced shock, this patient presents a critical competing priority: severe systolic heart failure (EF 25%). The clinical data overwhelmingly supports that the patient is already in a fluid-compromised state. The elevated BNP (1550 pg/mL), CXR findings of cardiomegaly and cephalization (early pulmonary edema), and declining SpO2 (91%) are red flags for heart failure exacerbation. Administering a large, rapid fluid bolus is highly likely to precipitate acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a life-threatening condition. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent iatrogenic harm. Therefore, clarifying this potentially lethal order with the provider before administration is the most critical safety action.",

This is a critical action. However, the volume of D50 is small (typically 50 mL) compared to the 1000 mL bolus. The risk of iatrogenic pulmonary edema from the large saline bolus represents a more immediate and severe potential for decompensation. The fluid order must be addressed first."

The combination of a history of severe heart failure (EF 25%), an extremely high BNP, worsening respiratory status (RR 28, SpO2 91%), and CXR findings of vascular congestion creates a direct contraindication to rapid, large-volume fluid administration.
