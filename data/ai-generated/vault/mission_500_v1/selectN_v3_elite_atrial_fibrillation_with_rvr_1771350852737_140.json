The client is already severely hypotensive (BP 84/58 mmHg) and showing signs of cardiogenic shock (cool/clammy skin, elevated lactate). Administering metoprolol would further compromise cardiac output and could lead to cardiovascular collapse."

            "isCorrect": false,

Activating the RRT or immediately notifying the provider is essential for rapid, high-level intervention, which may include vasopressors or emergent cardioversion."

Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to reduce venous return to the heart (preload) and allows for better lung expansion, which can help alleviate dyspnea associated with pulmonary edema."
