      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is contraindicated in this client exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock. Metoprolol decreases heart rate and contractility, further reducing cardiac output. The client's BP is 84/58 mmHg, and lactate is elevated at 4.8 mmol/L, indicating poor tissue perfusion. Beta-blockers block beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing cAMP and calcium influx, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This client needs interventions to *increase* cardiac output, not decrease it. Clinical Pearl: Never administer beta-blockers to patients in cardiogenic shock without expert consultation.",

    "opt_02": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Withholding metoprolol is crucial. The client's hypotension (84/58 mmHg) and signs of shock (cool, clammy skin, elevated lactate) indicate cardiogenic shock. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would further decrease heart rate and contractility, worsening the shock state. Cardiogenic shock results from the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. Administering a negative chronotrope/inotrope would exacerbate this. Clinical Pearl: Hypotension and signs of shock are absolute contraindications for beta-blocker administration.",

    },
    "opt_03": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. A fluid bolus is contraindicated. The client has pulmonary congestion and crackles, indicating fluid overload from heart failure. The chest x-ray confirms pulmonary vascular congestion. Administering more fluid would worsen pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. In cardiogenic shock, the heart cannot effectively pump blood, leading to fluid backing up into the lungs. Increasing preload with a fluid bolus will further strain the failing heart. Clinical Pearl: Assess for signs of fluid overload before administering fluids to patients with heart failure.",
      "scoreImpact": "-1"
    },
    "opt_04": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Activating the Rapid Response Team (RRT) is essential. The client is acutely decompensating with signs of cardiogenic shock: hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and poor perfusion. Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to stabilize hemodynamics and prevent organ damage. The RRT can provide advanced interventions such as vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine, dopamine) to increase blood pressure and improve cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Early recognition and rapid intervention are critical in managing cardiogenic shock to improve patient outcomes.",

      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Increasing oxygen flow is necessary. The client's SpO2 is 91% on 4L NC, indicating hypoxemia. Increasing oxygen delivery aims to improve tissue oxygenation and reduce the workload on the heart. Hypoxemia in cardiogenic shock results from pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange. Increasing FiO2 increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, improving oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries. Clinical Pearl: Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92% in patients with cardiogenic shock.",

    },
    "opt_06": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Placing the client in high-Fowler's position is appropriate. This position reduces venous return (preload) to the heart and promotes lung expansion, alleviating dyspnea associated with pulmonary edema. High-Fowler's position decreases venous return by increasing intrathoracic pressure and pooling blood in the lower extremities. This reduces the workload on the heart and improves respiratory mechanics. Clinical Pearl: High-Fowler's position is a simple yet effective intervention for managing dyspnea in patients with heart failure and pulmonary edema.",

Delaying intervention by one hour could result in irreversible organ damage or death. Immediate escalation of care is required. Cardiogenic shock requires immediate intervention to prevent end-organ damage from hypoperfusion. Clinical Pearl: In unstable patients, continuous monitoring and frequent reassessment are crucial, but should never delay necessary interventions.",
