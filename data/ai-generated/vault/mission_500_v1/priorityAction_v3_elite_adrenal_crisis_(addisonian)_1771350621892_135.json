      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While administering hydrocortisone is crucial to address the underlying adrenal crisis, it is not the *immediate* priority. The client's most pressing threat is severe hyperkalemia (6.4 mEq/L) evidenced by peaked T-waves on the ECG, indicating a high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias. The current IV fluid is exacerbating this condition. *Clinical Pearl:* Always address electrolyte imbalances that pose immediate threats to cardiac function before addressing hormonal deficiencies.",
      "pathophysiology": "Adrenal crisis leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone deficiency causes sodium loss and potassium retention. The lack of cortisol contributes to hypoglycemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia affects cardiac repolarization, leading to peaked T-waves and potentially fatal arrhythmias.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Peaked T-waves are a classic ECG finding in hyperkalemia. Always correlate lab values with clinical manifestations and ECG findings. In adrenal crisis, hypotension is often refractory to fluids alone and requires glucocorticoid replacement."
    },
    "opt2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client exhibits signs of adrenal crisis (hypotension, fatigue, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia) complicated by severe hyperkalemia (6.4 mEq/L) with ECG changes (peaked T-waves). The IV fluid containing potassium chloride (KCl) is directly worsening the hyperkalemia, posing an immediate risk of cardiac arrest. The nurse's priority is to *immediately* stop the infusion to prevent further potassium administration. This is a 'safety stop' to prevent iatrogenic harm. *Clinical Pearl:* Always assess IV fluid orders for contraindications based on the patient's current clinical status and lab values.",
      "pathophysiology": "The client's Addison's disease prevents adequate cortisol and aldosterone production. The stress of surgery, combined with missed hydrocortisone doses, has precipitated an adrenal crisis. The kidneys are unable to excrete potassium effectively due to hormonal imbalances, and the IV fluid is adding to the potassium load.",
      "clinicalPearls": "'Safety stops' are crucial nursing interventions to prevent medication errors and adverse events. Hyperkalemia can rapidly lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Be vigilant in monitoring potassium levels, especially in patients with renal insufficiency or endocrine disorders."
    },
    "opt3": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect. Administering it to a client who is already severely hyperkalemic and hypotensive is contraindicated and would be a medication error. The priority is to prevent harm. *Clinical Pearl:* ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with hyperkalemia or at risk for developing it.",
      "pathophysiology": "ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone promotes potassium excretion, so blocking its production can worsen hyperkalemia.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Always review a patient's medication list for potential drug interactions or contraindications, especially in the context of abnormal lab values."
    },
    "opt4": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While calcium gluconate is an appropriate treatment to stabilize the cardiac membrane in severe hyperkalemia, it requires a provider's order. The nurse's priority *independent* action, based on existing orders, is to first stop the source of the harm, which is the potassium-containing IV fluid. *Clinical Pearl:* Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels; it only protects the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia.",
      "pathophysiology": "Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential of cardiac cells, making them less excitable and less susceptible to arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Calcium gluconate is a temporary measure to protect the heart. It is essential to address the underlying cause of hyperkalemia to lower potassium levels."
    },
    "opt5": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While raising the foot of the bed and applying a non-rebreather mask can help with hypotension and hypoxia, these interventions address the *symptoms* of the adrenal crisis but not the lethal root cause (hyperkalemia worsened by the IV fluid). The immediate, preventable threat is cardiac arrest from the ongoing administration of potassium. Stopping the infusion is the most direct and impactful safety action. *Clinical Pearl:* Prioritize interventions that address the underlying cause of a problem over those that only treat the symptoms.",
      "pathophysiology": "Adrenal crisis leads to decreased vascular tone and fluid volume, causing hypotension. Hypoxia can result from decreased cardiac output and impaired oxygen delivery.",
