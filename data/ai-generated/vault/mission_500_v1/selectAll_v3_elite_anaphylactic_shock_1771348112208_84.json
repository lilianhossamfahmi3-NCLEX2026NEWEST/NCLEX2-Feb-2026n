Priorities are airway management, reversing bronchoconstriction, and supporting circulation. Intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment.

Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist. It stimulates alpha-1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure; beta-1 receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility; and beta-2 receptors, causing bronchodilation. This is the highest priority medication.",

Administering a beta-blocker would block this compensatory mechanism, worsen hypotension, and directly counteract the life-saving effects of epinephrine, leading to cardiovascular collapse. Beta-blockers inhibit the effects of catecholamines on beta-adrenergic receptors. In anaphylaxis, this prevents the body from mounting a compensatory response to hypotension and bronchoconstriction.",
