The client's potassium of 7.1 mEq/L and corresponding ECG changes (widened QRS, peaked T-waves, bradycardia) indicate severe hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity, which can lead to fatal dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Therefore, the highest priority is stabilizing the cardiac membrane with IV calcium gluconate (Action B). The next priorities involve 'stopping the line' on interventions that will worsen the situation: withholding lisinopril, which can exacerbate hyperkalemia (Action E), and canceling the CT with IV contrast, which is nephrotoxic and contraindicated in severe AKI (Action A). After taking these immediate life-saving and harm-prevention steps, instituting continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial for ongoing assessment (Action C). Finally, administering a fluid bolus is the lowest priority and potentially harmful (Action D), as the client is oliguric, and a fluid bolus could precipitate pulmonary edema without first addressing the life-threatening electrolyte imbalance.",
        "incorrect": "Any sequence that does not prioritize immediate cardioprotection with calcium gluconate is incorrect and places the client at risk for imminent cardiac arrest. Placing the client on monitoring (C) before acting on the known critical data is a delay in care. Proceeding with contraindicated medications (E) or procedures (A) constitutes a medical error. Administering a fluid bolus (D) without considering the client's oliguria and risk for fluid overload is unsafe and fails to address the primary life threat.",
