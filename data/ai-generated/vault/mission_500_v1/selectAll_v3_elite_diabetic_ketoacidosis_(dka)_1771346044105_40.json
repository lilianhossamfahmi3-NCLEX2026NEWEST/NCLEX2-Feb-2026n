Client lives in a remote, rural community and had unreliable transportation, delaying care for 2 days after symptom onset. Diagnosed with severe DKA and admitted to the ICU 4 hours ago. Treatment initiated with IV regular insulin infusion and 0.9% NaCl bolus, now receiving 0.45% NaCl. \n\n**Current Assessment (4 hours after admission):**\nClient is drowsy but arousable to voice. He is oriented to person and place, but unsure of the day. Reports a new-onset, persistent, dull headache rated 4/10. Appears more irritable and restless than on admission. Kussmaul respirations have resolved, breathing is even and unlabored. Skin is warm and dry. Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Bowel sounds are hypoactive."
