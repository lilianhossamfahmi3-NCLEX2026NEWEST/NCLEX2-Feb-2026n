Partial credit is awarded for each correct selection."

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "opt_1": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. New-onset headache, irritability, and restlessness are hallmark early signs of developing cerebral edema, a life-threatening complication of DKA treatment. In DKA, hyperglycemia causes hyperosmolality, drawing water out of brain cells. Rapid correction of hyperglycemia causes a rapid shift of fluid back into the brain cells, leading to swelling. These neurological changes are not expected improvements and indicate a dangerous increase in intracranial pressure. The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the cranial compartment is relatively incompressible, and the volume inside is fixed. An increase in one component (brain tissue, blood, or CSF) must be compensated by a decrease in another. In cerebral edema, the increase in brain tissue volume leads to increased intracranial pressure (ICP)."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. The corrected serum sodium has dropped significantly from 138 to 129 mEq/L. A rapid decrease in sodium, combined with a fast drop in glucose, creates a steep osmotic gradient, pulling free water from the bloodstream into brain cells and causing cerebral edema. The pathophysiology involves the movement of water across cell membranes to equalize osmolality. When serum sodium decreases rapidly, the extracellular fluid becomes hypotonic relative to the intracellular fluid, causing water to move into the cells, including brain cells. This is a critical finding that requires immediate intervention to prevent further neurological damage."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. Flattened T-waves and U-waves are expected findings with hypokalemia (current K+ is 3.4 mEq/L). Hypokalemia occurs in DKA due to several factors, including osmotic diuresis, vomiting, and insulin administration, which shifts potassium intracellularly. While this requires monitoring and likely potassium replacement, it does not represent the most immediate life-threatening emergency, which is the developing cerebral edema. This finding can distract the nurse from the more critical neurological changes. The priority is to address the cerebral edema risk before focusing solely on the hypokalemia, although both require attention."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. The serum glucose has dropped by over 400 mg/dL in 4 hours (greater than 100 mg/dL/hr). This overly rapid reduction in serum osmolality is a primary risk factor for cerebral edema. The rapid decrease in glucose causes a corresponding decrease in serum osmolality. This creates an osmotic gradient that favors water movement into the brain cells, which are now relatively hyperosmolar compared to the blood. The nurse must recognize that this rapid correction, while seeming positive, is dangerously fast and contributing to the neurological decline. Current guidelines recommend a slower correction of hyperglycemia in DKA to minimize the risk of cerebral edema."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. The anion gap decreasing from 28 to 16 is an expected and therapeutic finding, indicating the acidosis is resolving. The anion gap reflects the difference between measured cations (sodium and potassium) and measured anions (chloride and bicarbonate) in the serum. In DKA, the anion gap is elevated due to the presence of ketoacids. As insulin therapy is administered, the production of ketoacids decreases, and the anion gap normalizes. Focusing on this positive sign would cause the nurse to miss the emerging life-threatening complication."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. The administration of hypotonic fluid (0.45% NaCl) at a high rate (250 mL/hr) in the setting of rapidly falling glucose and sodium is the direct cause of the fluid shift causing cerebral edema. Hypotonic fluids have a lower osmolality than plasma, which further exacerbates the osmotic gradient and promotes water movement into the brain cells. The nurse must immediately question this order and advocate for a change to isotonic fluids (0.9% NaCl) or a reduction in the infusion rate. This is the 'SAFETY STOP' moment; proceeding with this infusion is dangerous and must be challenged."
