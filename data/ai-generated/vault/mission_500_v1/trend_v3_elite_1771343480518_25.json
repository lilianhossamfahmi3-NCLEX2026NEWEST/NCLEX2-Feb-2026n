The key features displayed are extreme hyperthermia (40.6°C), autonomic instability (tachycardia 148 bpm, labile BP), altered mental status (confusion), and severe muscle rigidity ('lead-pipe rigidity'). The laboratory results confirm this diagnosis with a massive elevation in Creatine Kinase (CK) to 22,500 U/L, indicating severe muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), along with leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr). The nurse's immediate priorities are to stop the offending agent (haloperidol), activate emergency response, initiate life-saving supportive measures to address hyperthermia and prevent further kidney damage from rhabdomyolysis, and obtain orders for definitive treatment.",
            "incorrect": "Administering more haloperidol would be catastrophic, fueling the underlying pathological process and likely leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Attributing the client's confusion and agitation to worsening psychosis is a critical thinking error that fails to recognize the medical emergency. Administering acetaminophen is inappropriate as the hyperthermia in NMS is caused by central dopaminergic blockade affecting hypothalamic thermoregulation, not by pyrogens, making antipyretics ineffective. While benztropine is used for extrapyramidal side effects like dystonia, it is not a primary treatment for the global, severe rigidity of NMS and can worsen the condition due to its anticholinergic effects, which impair heat dissipation.",
