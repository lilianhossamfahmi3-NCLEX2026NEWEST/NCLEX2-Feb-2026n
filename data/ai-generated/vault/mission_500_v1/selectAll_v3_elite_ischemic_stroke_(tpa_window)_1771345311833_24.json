At 1030, partner found client slouched in his chair with expressive aphasia and inability to lift his right arm. Partner reports delaying the call to EMS due to concerns about hospital costs. Initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 16. Non-contrast head CT completed. Partner confirms client took his last dose of apixaban 'last night before bed'."
