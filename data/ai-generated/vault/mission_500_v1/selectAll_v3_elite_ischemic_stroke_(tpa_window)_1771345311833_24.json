At 1030, partner found client slouched in his chair with expressive aphasia and inability to lift his right arm. Partner reports delaying the call to EMS due to concerns about hospital costs. Initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 16. Non-contrast head CT completed. Partner confirms client took his last dose of apixaban 'last night before bed'."

While elevated blood pressure is a concern in acute stroke management, the client's current blood pressure of 175/96 mmHg is below the 185/110 mmHg threshold that contraindicates alteplase administration. The initial elevated BP was likely addressed with antihypertensive medications. The priority is to maintain BP within the acceptable range for thrombolysis. \n\nPathophysiology: Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage during thrombolytic therapy. Alteplase can exacerbate bleeding, making BP control crucial.\n\nClinical Pearl: Monitor BP closely before, during, and after alteplase administration. Use antihypertensives to maintain BP <185/110 mmHg.",

      "rationale": "Correct. A platelet count of 88,000/mm³ indicates thrombocytopenia, which is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that dissolves clots but also carries a significant risk of bleeding. In a client with a low platelet count, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is greatly increased due to impaired clotting ability. The nurse must immediately notify the provider to discuss alternative treatment options.\n\nPathophysiology: Platelets are essential for blood clot formation. Thrombocytopenia impairs the body's ability to stop bleeding, increasing the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain during thrombolysis.\n\nClinical Pearl: Always check platelet count before administering alteplase. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm³) is a critical contraindication.",

Alteplase is typically administered within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Therefore, the client is within the acceptable time window for alteplase administration, making this an indication for treatment, not a contraindication.\n\nPathophysiology: Early thrombolysis improves outcomes by restoring blood flow to the ischemic penumbra, the area of potentially salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct. Delaying treatment reduces the chance of recovery.\n\nClinical Pearl: Time is brain! Rapid assessment and intervention are crucial in acute stroke management.",

Apixaban increases the risk of bleeding, and when combined with alteplase, the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage, including intracranial hemorrhage, is significantly elevated. The nurse must immediately notify the provider to discuss alternative treatment options.\n\nPathophysiology: Apixaban inhibits factor Xa, a key component of the coagulation cascade, preventing thrombin formation and clot stabilization. Alteplase further disrupts clot formation, leading to an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nClinical Pearl: Obtain a thorough medication history, including the timing of the last dose of anticoagulants, before administering alteplase. Recent use of direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors is a contraindication.",

This score is an indication for thrombolytic therapy, not a contraindication. Alteplase aims to minimize deficits in clients with such scores by restoring blood flow to the affected brain tissue.\n\nPathophysiology: The NIHSS quantifies the severity of neurological deficits caused by the stroke. Higher scores indicate more extensive brain damage and a greater potential benefit from thrombolysis.\n\nClinical Pearl: The NIHSS score helps quantify stroke severity and guide treatment decisions. Higher scores indicate more severe deficits and potential benefit from alteplase if no contraindications exist.",

While an elevated INR (typically >1.7) would be a concern, this client's INR is acceptable. However, it's crucial to remember that INR is not a reliable measure of anticoagulation in clients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like apixaban. The history of apixaban use is the critical factor here.\n\nPathophysiology: INR measures the effect of warfarin on the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
