The pericardial sac, when filled with excessive fluid, compresses the heart, leading to impaired ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output. This compression manifests as a sensation of fullness or pressure in the chest. This is further exacerbated by the patient's ESRD, which can contribute to fluid overload and uremic pericarditis, increasing the risk of effusion."

Cardiac tamponade restricts the heart's ability to fill properly, leading to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. The resulting hypoxemia and increased work of breathing contribute to the sensation of shortness of breath. The patient's underlying ESRD further complicates this, as uremic toxins can impair respiratory function and exacerbate dyspnea."

The fluid-filled pericardial sac acts as an insulator, dampening the transmission of heart sounds. This finding is highly indicative of a significant pericardial effusion compressing the heart. The presence of ESRD increases the likelihood of uremic pericarditis, which can lead to the development of a pericardial effusion."

Cardiac tamponade obstructs venous return to the heart, causing blood to back up into the systemic circulation, leading to jugular venous distention. This is a critical sign of right-sided heart failure secondary to the tamponade. The patient's ESRD contributes to fluid overload, further exacerbating the JVD."
