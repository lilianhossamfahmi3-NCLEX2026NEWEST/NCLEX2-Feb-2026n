Cardiac tamponade is a form of obstructive shock where fluid in the pericardial sac compresses the heart, preventing it from filling and pumping effectively. Initiating hemodialysis in this state is contraindicated and potentially fatal. The procedure involves anticoagulation (heparin), which would worsen any potential hemorrhage into the pericardial space, and fluid removal, which would critically reduce preload and cause cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must withhold dialysis and immediately notify the provider for emergency intervention (e.g., pericardiocentesis).",
