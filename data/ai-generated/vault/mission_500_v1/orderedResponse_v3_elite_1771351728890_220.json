The most critical finding is severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) with resultant cardiotoxicity (peaked T-waves, wide QRS), indicating an imminent risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. Therefore, the first priority is to place the client on a cardiac monitor for continuous assessment (Safety/Assessment). The second priority is to administer the most rapid intervention to correct the hyperkalemia, which is IV regular insulin (Immediate Treatment). Once the immediate cardiac threat is being addressed, the next priority is to treat the shock by initiating the norepinephrine infusion to raise the MAP > 65 mmHg and restore organ perfusion (Circulation). Next, the underlying cause of the sepsis must be treated by administering the broad-spectrum antibiotic (Treat the Cause). Finally, after implementing these critical interventions, the nurse must evaluate the client's response by re-assessing the MAP (Evaluation).",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence poses a significant safety risk. For example, administering the antibiotic or vasopressor before addressing the severe hyperkalemia ignores the most immediate life threat—cardiac arrest. The client's heart is electrically unstable and could arrest at any moment. Similarly, re-assessing the MAP before intervening is illogical and delays life-saving care. The sepsis bundle is critical, but it must be adapted when a concurrent, life-threatening condition like severe hyperkalemia is present. The nurse's primary responsibility is to recognize and act on the most immediate threat to life.",

The combination of a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L and ECG changes (peaked T-waves, wide QRS) indicates severe cardiotoxicity. This places the client at immediate risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or asystole. Continuous monitoring is essential for immediate detection of clinical deterioration and is a foundational safety measure before other interventions are performed."
