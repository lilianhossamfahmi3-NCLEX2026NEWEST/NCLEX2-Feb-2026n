Client reports a sudden onset of severe, 'tearing' 10/10 pain that started in his abdomen and radiates to his lower back about an hour ago. Client appears pale, diaphoretic, and is very anxious. Skin is cool to the touch. He states, 'I felt like I was going to pass out.' Client has a known history of a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypertension, and COPD. He states he lives alone in a rural area and had to wait for his neighbor to get home from work to drive him to the hospital, which is 45 minutes away. On examination, a pulsatile mass is palpated in the mid-abdomen. Bilateral peripheral pulses are present but thready."
