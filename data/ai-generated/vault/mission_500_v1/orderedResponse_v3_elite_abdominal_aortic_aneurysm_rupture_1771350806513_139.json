Client reports a sudden onset of severe, 'tearing' 10/10 pain that started in his abdomen and radiates to his lower back about an hour ago. Client appears pale, diaphoretic, and is very anxious. Skin is cool to the touch. He states, 'I felt like I was going to pass out.' Client has a known history of a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypertension, and COPD. He states he lives alone in a rural area and had to wait for his neighbor to get home from work to drive him to the hospital, which is 45 minutes away. On examination, a pulsatile mass is palpated in the mid-abdomen. Bilateral peripheral pulses are present but thready."

The nurse must synthesize all data (history, pulsatile mass, pain description, and vital sign trajectory) to recognize the life-threatening situation and prioritize interventions. The most critical priority is preventing any action that would worsen the client's condition.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** A ruptured AAA causes massive internal bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock. The body's compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia, increased respiratory rate) are failing, as evidenced by the declining blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoperfusion. The elevated creatinine and BUN suggest acute kidney injury secondary to hypoperfusion. While the slightly elevated troponin could indicate myocardial ischemia, the overall clinical picture strongly points to a ruptured AAA as the primary problem.",

The client is actively bleeding internally from a suspected AAA rupture, as evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, low hemoglobin, and high lactate. Administering an anticoagulant would be a catastrophic, life-threatening error that would accelerate hemorrhage and lead to certain death. This is a 'DO NOT PROCEED' safety stop to prevent iatrogenic harm.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Heparin inhibits the clotting cascade, preventing the formation of blood clots. In a patient with active bleeding, this would exacerbate the hemorrhage and worsen the hypovolemic shock.",

The provider likely ordered heparin due to the slightly elevated troponin, considering a possible myocardial infarction. The nurse must use SBAR to communicate the full clinical picture of hemorrhagic shock from a ruptured AAA, which is the more likely diagnosis and makes anticoagulation contraindicated. This action corrects the plan of care.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** The provider's initial assessment may have focused on the elevated troponin, leading to a consideration of NSTEMI. However, the nurse's comprehensive assessment reveals the more pressing issue of a ruptured AAA. Effective communication is crucial to ensure the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.",

While one IV is in place, establishing a second large-bore (16-18 gauge) IV is a critical preparation step that must be done immediately to facilitate rapid, simultaneous infusions. This action prepares the client for the necessary life-saving treatments.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Large-bore IVs allow for rapid infusion of fluids and blood products, which is essential to restore intravascular volume and oxygen-carrying capacity in hemorrhagic shock.",

Therefore, it follows the immediate actions of preventing harm, clarifying orders, and initiating resuscitation with readily available fluids.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Packed red blood cells increase the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, improving the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and delivering oxygen to tissues.
