In the ED, client received a 1L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride for hypotension. On arrival to the unit, client is alert and oriented to person and place. Skin is cool and clammy. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. \n\n**1200:** The provider's sepsis bundle orders are in place. Client reports feeling increasingly short of breath and has developed a new, non-productive cough. On assessment, jugular venous distention (JVD) is now noted at 45 degrees. Lung auscultation reveals newly developed bilateral basilar crackles. Client appears anxious. Peripheral edema is +2 in lower extremities."
