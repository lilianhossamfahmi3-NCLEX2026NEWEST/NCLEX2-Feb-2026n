In the ED, client received a 1L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride for hypotension. On arrival to the unit, client is alert and oriented to person and place. Skin is cool and clammy. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. \n\n**1200 (12:00 PM):** The provider's sepsis bundle orders are in place. Client reports feeling increasingly short of breath and has developed a new, non-productive cough. On assessment, jugular venous distention (JVD) is now noted at 45 degrees. Lung auscultation reveals newly developed bilateral basilar crackles. Client appears anxious. Peripheral edema is +2 in lower extremities."

    "rationale": "The client is exhibiting signs of fluid volume overload secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation for septic shock, complicated by underlying HFpEF and Stage 3 CKD. The 1L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride, intended to increase blood pressure, has exacerbated the client's condition, leading to pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. The elevated BNP confirms the presence of heart failure and fluid overload. The nurse must recognize the iatrogenic harm and intervene to prevent further deterioration. Septic shock causes vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts and hypotension. While fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management, it must be carefully titrated, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac or renal dysfunction. In HFpEF, the heart's ability to relax and fill properly is impaired, making it susceptible to fluid overload. CKD further compromises the body's ability to excrete excess fluid, increasing the risk of pulmonary edema. The combination of these factors makes this client particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of aggressive fluid administration.",

      {
        "option": "increasingly short of breath",
        "justification": "(+) This subjective report indicates worsening respiratory distress, a key symptom of pulmonary edema. Fluid accumulation in the lungs impairs gas exchange, leading to shortness of breath. This is a direct consequence of the fluid bolus in a client with compromised cardiac function."

        "option": "newly developed bilateral basilar crackles",
        "justification": "(+) These adventitious lung sounds are a classic sign of pulmonary edema. Crackles are caused by air passing through fluid-filled alveoli. The 'newly developed' aspect is crucial, indicating a recent change in the client's condition directly related to the fluid bolus."

      {
        "option": "SpO2 (%) 88% (4L NC)",

        "option": "BNP (pg/mL) 2150",

An extremely elevated BNP level strongly suggests heart failure and fluid overload. This lab value supports the clinical findings of pulmonary edema and respiratory distress."
