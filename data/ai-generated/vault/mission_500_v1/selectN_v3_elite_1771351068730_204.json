    "correct": "The client is in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia (serum glucose >250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH <7.3, HCO3 <15 mEq/L), and ketosis (elevated serum ketones). This occurs due to insulin deficiency, leading to unrestrained lipolysis and the production of ketone bodies, resulting in acidemia. However, the most immediate life-threatening finding is the critical hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L), confirmed by the ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U waves). Insulin therapy, while essential for treating DKA, causes an intracellular shift of potassium by stimulating Na+/K+-ATPase, which would worsen the existing hypokalemia and precipitate potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole). Therefore, the nurse's priority is to 'stop' and address this safety risk. The correct actions are to withhold the insulin, initiate potassium replacement, place the client on a cardiac monitor to observe for dysrhythmias, and immediately notify the provider of the critical situation. DKA guidelines state that insulin infusion should not be started if the serum potassium is less than 3.3 mEq/L.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either directly harmful or not the immediate priority. Initiating insulin is the most dangerous action as it would exacerbate life-threatening hypokalemia. Administering sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended in DKA as it can worsen hypokalemia and cerebral edema; the acidosis will correct with fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy once it is safe to begin.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This is a life-threatening error. Insulin drives potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, decreasing serum potassium levels. In DKA, insulin stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, facilitating potassium entry into cells. With a starting potassium of 2.9 mEq/L, administering insulin would cause a rapid and severe drop in serum potassium, leading to cardiac muscle instability and fatal dysrhythmias. This action is contraindicated until the potassium level is corrected to at least 3.3 mEq/L. The priority is to correct the hypokalemia before initiating insulin therapy."

        "justification": "This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. Recognizing the contraindication of severe hypokalemia (K+ < 3.3 mEq/L) to insulin therapy is the priority nursing judgment. Withholding the insulin prevents iatrogenic cardiac arrest and allows for safe potassium correction first. Insulin administration in the presence of hypokalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias."

Potassium replacement is crucial to prevent cardiac complications."

        "justification": "This is an essential safety and monitoring intervention. The client is at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias due to the existing hypokalemia and the fluid/electrolyte shifts that will occur during treatment. Hypokalemia affects the repolarization of the heart, leading to arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Continuous ECG monitoring allows for immediate detection of any arrhythmias."

The nurse must inform the provider of the critical potassium level and the fact that the insulin infusion is being held. This ensures the plan of care is coordinated and the provider is aware of the client's immediate life-threatening condition. Prompt communication ensures timely and appropriate management."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This action is incorrect and potentially harmful. Sodium bicarbonate is rarely used in DKA management (typically only for severe, life-threatening acidemia, pH < 6.9) because it can cause paradoxical cerebral acidosis, fluid overload, and further decrease serum potassium levels. The acidosis will resolve as the underlying cause (ketosis) is treated with IV fluids and, eventually, insulin. Bicarbonate administration can also lead to a rapid shift in the oxygen dissociation curve, impairing oxygen delivery to tissues."
