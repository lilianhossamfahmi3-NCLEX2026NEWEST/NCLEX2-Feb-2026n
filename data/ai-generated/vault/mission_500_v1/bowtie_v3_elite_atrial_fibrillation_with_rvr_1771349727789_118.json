            "cond_1": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive and tachycardic, the primary driver of their instability is not cardiac pump failure. The negative troponin makes an acute MI unlikely. The core problem is neurological.",
            "cond_2": "Incorrect. While an ischemic stroke can be caused by atrial fibrillation, the client's history of a fall, supratherapeutic INR, and rapid neurological decline with signs of brainstem compression (pupil changes) are more indicative of a hemorrhagic event, not an ischemic one.",
            "cond_3": "Correct. The combination of a recent head injury (fall), a dangerously high INR of 5.8 (supratherapeutic anticoagulation), and acute neurological changes (lethargy, anisocoria, facial droop, motor drift) is classic for an intracranial hemorrhage leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This is a life-threatening emergency that must be addressed before the atrial fibrillation.",
            "cond_4": "Incorrect. There is no evidence of significant fluid or blood loss to suggest hypovolemia. The hypotension is more likely due to distributive shock from the brain injury (Cushing's triad late stage) or the rapid ventricular rate.",
            "cond_5": "Incorrect. While the client has pre-existing CKD and an elevated BUN/Creatinine, this is a chronic/subacute issue and not the cause of the acute, life-threatening presentation."
        },
        "actions": {
            "act_1": "Incorrect. This is a critical safety stop. Administering diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, will cause vasodilation and further decrease the blood pressure. In a patient with increased ICP, this would catastrophically lower the Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP), leading to brain ischemia, herniation, and death.",
            "act_2": "Correct. The client is experiencing acute neurological deterioration and hemodynamic instability (hypotension). This meets the criteria for immediate escalation by activating the Rapid Response Team or calling the provider for emergent intervention.",
            "act_3": "Correct. The INR of 5.8 indicates a critical level of anticoagulation that is fueling the suspected intracranial bleed. Emergency reversal with Vitamin K and a rapid-acting agent like Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is a priority to stop the hemorrhage.",
            "act_4": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, administering a large fluid bolus without a clear indication of hypovolemia can worsen cerebral edema and increase ICP. Fluid management in these patients must be cautious and guided by the provider to balance systemic perfusion with neurological protection.",
            "act_5": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a supine (flat) position would increase intracranial pressure by impeding venous drainage from the head. The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees to promote venous outflow and help lower ICP."
        },
        "monitors": {
            "mon_1": "Incorrect. While the cardiac rhythm is the reason for admission, the immediate life-threat is neurological. Monitoring the rhythm is secondary to monitoring for brain herniation.",
            "mon_2": "Incorrect. Monitoring urine output is important for assessing renal function and fluid status, but it is not a primary parameter for tracking the immediate life-threatening condition of increased ICP.",
            "mon_3": "Correct. Frequent and meticulous assessment of neurological status (Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary size and reactivity, motor function) is the most critical monitoring parameter to detect worsening ICP and impending brain herniation.",
            "mon_4": "Incorrect. While a follow-up INR is needed to confirm the effectiveness of reversal agents, it is not a parameter that requires minute-to-minute monitoring to assess the client's acute deterioration. Neuro status and BP are more immediate.",
            "mon_5": "Correct. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is crucial for calculating and maintaining adequate Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP). Hypotension must be aggressively managed to prevent secondary brain injury from ischemia. The trending hypotension is a key indicator of decompensation."
