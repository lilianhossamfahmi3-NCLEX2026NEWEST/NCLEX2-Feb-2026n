    "correct": "The client is most likely experiencing compartment syndrome, a condition where increased pressure within a confined space (in this case, the lower leg) compromises blood supply to tissues. The pathophysiology involves a cycle of swelling, increased pressure, and decreased perfusion. The initial fracture and subsequent edema from tissue damage contribute to swelling within the rigid cast. This increased pressure compresses blood vessels, leading to ischemia and further swelling. Muscle and nerve cells become hypoxic, causing intense pain. If left untreated, the ischemia progresses to necrosis, leading to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), releasing myoglobin and potassium into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). The hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of decreased tissue perfusion and pain. The priority nursing actions are to immediately notify the provider (at 1430) to facilitate emergent fasciotomy (surgical decompression) to relieve the pressure and restore blood flow. The affected limb should be placed at the level of the heart to optimize arterial perfusion without increasing edema. Elevating the limb would further compromise arterial blood flow. Administering ketorolac is contraindicated due to the risk of further kidney damage in the setting of AKI. Obtaining a different opioid will not address the underlying problem of increased compartment pressure.",

Key signs of hypovolemic shock, such as decreased urine output and altered mental status, are not present."

Compartment syndrome is the most likely diagnosis given the client's severe pain unrelieved by opioids, tense and shiny skin, swelling, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) and potassium levels. These findings indicate muscle ischemia and necrosis due to increased pressure within the confined space of the lower leg. The pain is disproportionate to the injury and is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome. The elevated CK and potassium are indicative of rhabdomyolysis, a complication of prolonged ischemia."
