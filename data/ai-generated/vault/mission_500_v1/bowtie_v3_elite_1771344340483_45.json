Reports severe, deep, throbbing pain in the right lower leg, rated 10/10. Pain is constant and unrelieved by two doses of IV morphine since the cast was applied. States the pain is 'like my leg is going to explode.' On inspection, the right lower leg is visibly swollen and the skin is tense and shiny. Capillary refill in right toes is 3 seconds. Toes are cool to the touch compared to the left foot."

The constellation of the '5 Ps' (pain out of proportion, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness - a very late sign, and paralysis) alongside systemic findings confirms this life- and limb-threatening emergency. The extreme pain unrelieved by potent opioids is the cardinal symptom. The tense, swollen leg indicates rising intracompartmental pressure, which is compressing blood vessels and nerves. This ischemia leads to muscle cell death (rhabdomyolysis), releasing myoglobin and potassium into the bloodstream. The critically high CK (25,000 U/L) confirms massive muscle breakdown. The subsequent hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L) poses an immediate risk for fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules, causing AKI, evidenced by the elevated BUN and creatinine. The progressive tachycardia and drop in blood pressure signal developing systemic shock. The priority nursing actions are to immediately notify the provider for emergency intervention (fasciotomy) and to position the limb correctly at the level of the heart (neutral position) to maximize arterial inflow without increasing edematous swelling. Any action that would delay definitive treatment, mask symptoms, or worsen organ damage must be avoided.",
