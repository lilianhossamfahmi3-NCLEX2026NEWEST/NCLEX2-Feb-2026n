Administering furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, would cause further volume depletion, critically reducing cardiac preload and precipitating cardiovascular collapse. The priority 'DON'T PROCEED' action is to hold the furosemide. The most critical 'DO PROCEED' action is to escalate care for refractory shock.
