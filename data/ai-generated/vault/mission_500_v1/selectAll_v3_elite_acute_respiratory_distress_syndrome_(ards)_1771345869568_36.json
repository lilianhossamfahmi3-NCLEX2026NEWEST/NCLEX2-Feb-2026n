Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS (P/F ratio 110). Placed on assist-control ventilation. Fentanyl and propofol infusions initiated for sedation, target RASS -4.\n\n<b>1200:</b> Persistent ventilator dyssynchrony despite increasing sedation. Peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) are rising. Healthcare provider (HCP) at bedside, new order for continuous cisatracurium infusion placed to improve ventilator synchrony and chest wall compliance.\n\n<b>1300:</b> Called to bedside for high pressure alarms on the ventilator. Client is unarousable to stimulus (RASS -5). Asymmetric chest rise noted. Right pupil is 5 mm and sluggish to react; left pupil is 3 mm and briskly reactive. At 1000, pupils were 3 mm, equal, and reactive."

      "rationale": "Correct. The client's change in vital signs (bradycardia, hypertension), asymmetric chest rise, and unequal pupils at 1300 indicate a possible neurological event, such as increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or brain herniation. These findings are consistent with Cushing's triad. Cisatracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent that would paralyze the client, masking any further neurological changes (e.g., seizures, posturing) and preventing accurate assessment. Withholding the cisatracurium allows for continued neurological assessment and prevents masking of critical signs. Clinical Pearl: Never administer a paralytic without ruling out neurological emergencies first. Paralytics mask neurological signs, delaying critical interventions.",

The client's neurological status is rapidly deteriorating, and paralysis would mask critical signs needed for diagnosis and treatment. The priority is to identify and address the underlying cause of the neurological changes, not to simply treat ventilator dyssynchrony. Clinical Pearl: Paralytics should be used cautiously in patients with altered mental status or new neurological findings.",

The client's vital signs at 1300 (bradycardia, hypertension with widened pulse pressure), combined with unequal pupils and asymmetric chest rise, suggest a critical neurological event, possibly increased ICP or brain herniation. This situation requires immediate intervention. Notifying the healthcare provider and activating the Rapid Response Team (RRT) ensures prompt evaluation and treatment. Clinical Pearl: Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension, irregular respirations) is a late sign of increased ICP and requires immediate action.",

Increasing propofol would further depress the client's level of consciousness and potentially worsen hypotension, without addressing the underlying neurological problem. The ventilator dyssynchrony is likely secondary to the neurological event, not inadequate sedation. Clinical Pearl: Addressing the underlying cause is crucial. Increasing sedation will not resolve a neurological emergency and may mask critical signs.",

Disconnecting the client from the ventilator and manually ventilating with a bag-valve mask allows the nurse to assess lung compliance, ensure adequate oxygenation, and troubleshoot the cause of the respiratory distress. Manual ventilation provides immediate support while further evaluation is performed. Clinical Pearl: Always troubleshoot respiratory distress by first ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
