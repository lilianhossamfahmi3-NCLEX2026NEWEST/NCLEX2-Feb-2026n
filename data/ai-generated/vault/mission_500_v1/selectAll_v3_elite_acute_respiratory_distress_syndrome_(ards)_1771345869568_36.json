Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS (P/F ratio 110). Placed on assist-control ventilation. Fentanyl and propofol infusions initiated for sedation, target RASS -4.\n\n<b>1200:</b> Persistent ventilator dyssynchrony despite increasing sedation. Peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) are rising. Healthcare provider (HCP) at bedside, new order for continuous cisatracurium infusion placed to improve ventilator synchrony and chest wall compliance.\n\n<b>1300:</b> Called to bedside for high pressure alarms on the ventilator. Client is unarousable to stimulus (RASS -5). Asymmetric chest rise noted. Right pupil is 5 mm and sluggish to react; left pupil is 3 mm and briskly reactive. At 1000, pupils were 3 mm, equal, and reactive."

The combination of Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension with widening pulse pressure) and a new focal neurological deficit (unequal pupils) signifies a medical emergency, highly suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and impending brain herniation. This requires immediate escalation to the RRT and HCP for urgent intervention."

The ventilator dyssynchrony and high pressures are not due to inadequate sedation but are likely caused by the underlying neurological event. Increasing propofol would not address the root cause and could worsen hypotension or further obscure the neurological exam."

Disconnecting the client and manually ventilating with 100% FiO2 is a critical first step. This allows the nurse to assess lung compliance by feel (e.g., is it stiff?), rule out ventilator malfunction, and ensure oxygenation while investigating causes like pneumothorax or severe bronchospasm."
