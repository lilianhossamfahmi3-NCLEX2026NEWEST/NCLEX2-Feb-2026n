The client's LKW is 1200, and the current time is 1400, placing them within the window. \n\n*Pathophysiology*: Alteplase is most effective when administered early in the course of an ischemic stroke to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the penumbral region (area of potentially salvageable brain tissue). Delay increases the risk of irreversible damage.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Always confirm the LKW with a reliable source (family, witnesses) and document it meticulously. This finding supports eligibility.",

      "column": "c1",
      "reasoning": "A non-contrast head CT showing no hemorrhage is mandatory before Alteplase. It rules out hemorrhagic stroke, where Alteplase would be fatal.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that breaks down blood clots. In a hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding is already occurring in the brain. Alteplase would exacerbate the bleeding, leading to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Never administer Alteplase without confirming the absence of hemorrhage on a CT scan. This finding supports eligibility.",

      "column": "c2",
      "reasoning": "A significant blood pressure difference between arms (typically >20 mmHg systolic) raises suspicion for aortic dissection, a life-threatening condition. \n\n*Pathophysiology*: Aortic dissection involves a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall. This can lead to aortic rupture, stroke, or organ ischemia. Alteplase would increase the risk of aortic rupture due to its thrombolytic effect.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Always assess blood pressure in both arms in patients presenting with stroke-like symptoms, especially if they report chest or back pain. This finding is a contraindication.",

      "row": "r4",
      "column": "c2",
      "reasoning": "Widened mediastinum on chest x-ray is a classic sign of aortic dissection. This finding, combined with the tearing back pain and BP discrepancy, strongly suggests a diagnosis other than a simple ischemic stroke.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: The mediastinum contains the heart, great vessels, trachea, and esophagus. Widening suggests bleeding or expansion within this space, often due to aortic dissection or rupture. Alteplase would worsen the bleeding.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: A widened mediastinum is a 'SAFETY STOP' signal. Immediately notify the physician and consider alternative diagnoses. This is an absolute contraindication to Alteplase therapy and requires immediate escalation to the provider to halt the stroke protocol.",

      "reasoning": "An INR of 1.1 is within the normal range. An elevated INR (>1.7) would indicate impaired coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding with Alteplase.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: INR measures the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. An elevated INR indicates that the blood is taking longer to clot, increasing the risk of bleeding. Alteplase further impairs clot formation.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Review all coagulation studies before administering Alteplase. This finding, by itself, indicates that the client's coagulation status is acceptable for fibrinolytic therapy and thus supports eligibility.",
