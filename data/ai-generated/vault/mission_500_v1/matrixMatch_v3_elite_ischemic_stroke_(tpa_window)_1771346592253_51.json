Last known well at 12:00 today per spouse. Spouse, who speaks limited English and is using a translator phone, reports that just before the weakness began, the client yelled out, grabbed his chest, and complained of a sudden, severe 'tearing' pain in his back between his shoulder blades. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 16."
