States pain began approximately 18 hours ago but he didn't want to be a 'bother' and lacked transportation until his son finished work. Skin is pale, cool, and diaphoretic. Abdomen is distended with a visible pulsatile mass left of the umbilicus. Bilateral pedal pulses are present but weak (+1).\n\n18:30: Client is increasingly anxious and restless, stating, 'I feel like something terrible is about to happen.' Remains A&O x4. Capillary refill is 4 seconds.\n\n19:00: Client's level of consciousness has declined; now oriented to person only. Mottling is noted on bilateral lower extremities. Urine output from newly placed indwelling catheter is 10 mL over the last 30 minutes."
