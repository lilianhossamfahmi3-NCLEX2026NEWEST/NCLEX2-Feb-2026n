States pain began approximately 18 hours ago but he didn't want to be a 'bother' and lacked transportation until his son finished work. Skin is pale, cool, and diaphoretic. Abdomen is distended with a visible pulsatile mass left of the umbilicus. Bilateral pedal pulses are present but weak (+1).\n\n18:30: Client is increasingly anxious and restless, stating, 'I feel like something terrible is about to happen.' Remains A&O x4. Capillary refill is 4 seconds.\n\n19:00: Client's level of consciousness has declined; now oriented to person only. Mottling is noted on bilateral lower extremities. Urine output from newly placed indwelling catheter is 10 mL over the last 30 minutes."

    "correct": "The client presents with classic signs and symptoms of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including sudden onset of severe, tearing abdominal pain radiating to the back, hypotension, tachycardia, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. The trended data reveals a rapid decline in blood pressure (104/72 mmHg to 78/48 mmHg) and increasing heart rate (108 bpm to 134 bpm), indicating worsening hypovolemic shock. Mottling of the lower extremities, decreased level of consciousness, and oliguria (10 mL urine output in 30 minutes) further support this diagnosis. Elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L) indicates anaerobic metabolism due to poor tissue perfusion. The priority is to stabilize the client and prepare for immediate surgical intervention to repair the ruptured AAA. Activating the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) is crucial to address the ongoing blood loss and coagulopathy. Establishing a second large-bore IV ensures adequate access for rapid fluid and blood product administration. Preparing the client for immediate transfer to the operating room is essential for definitive surgical repair.",

In the setting of hypovolemic shock, administering metoprolol can further compromise cardiac output and lead to cardiovascular collapse. The client's compensatory tachycardia is essential to maintain blood pressure. Administering this medication is contraindicated and could be fatal. **Clinical Pearl:** *Never administer beta-blockers to hypotensive patients without specific orders and careful consideration of the underlying cause of hypotension.*",

The Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) provides a standardized approach to rapidly transfuse blood products (packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) in a balanced ratio to restore blood volume, oxygen-carrying capacity, and coagulation factors. This is crucial for stabilizing the client before and during surgery. **Pathophysiology:** *Rupture of the AAA leads to rapid exsanguination into the retroperitoneal space. The body's compensatory mechanisms, such as increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, are overwhelmed, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and end-organ damage. MTP aims to reverse these effects by replenishing lost blood volume and correcting coagulopathy.*",
