The combination of high PEEP (16 cm H2O) and severe hypoxemia causes significant pulmonary vasoconstriction, drastically increasing pulmonary artery pressures (afterload for the RV). This strain on the RV is evidenced by the rapidly rising CVP (from 12 to 18 mmHg), the new hypotension requiring vasopressors (MAP 66 despite norepinephrine), tachycardia (135 bpm), and elevated cardiac biomarkers (Troponin and BNP) indicating myocardial stretch and injury. The elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L) and decreased urine output confirm end-organ hypoperfusion and shock. The critical 'STOP' action is to recognize that the order for a 500 mL fluid bolus is now contraindicated. Administering more fluid (preload) to a failing right ventricle will worsen RV distention, cause a leftward septal shift that impairs left ventricular filling, and precipitate complete cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must withhold this fluid, immediately notify the provider and respiratory therapist about the client's precipitous decline, and closely monitor parameters indicative of perfusion and RV function, such as CVP and lactate.",

Misinterpreting the hypotension as simple fluid deficit and giving the bolus is a fatal error. Increasing PEEP would worsen RV strain.
