    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of impending cardiovascular collapse secondary to acute right ventricular (RV) failure, a life-threatening complication of severe ARDS. The pathophysiology involves increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to alveolar hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as compression of pulmonary capillaries from high PEEP (16 cm H2O). This increased resistance leads to RV overload and dilation. The rising CVP (12 mmHg to 18 mmHg) indicates increased RV preload and impaired RV contractility. Hypotension (MAP 66 mmHg despite norepinephrine) and tachycardia (135 bpm) reflect decreased cardiac output. Elevated troponin and BNP suggest myocardial ischemia and ventricular stretch, respectively. Elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L) and decreased urine output (<0.5 mL/kg/hr) indicate end-organ hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. The critical action is to withhold the ordered 0.9% sodium chloride bolus. Administering additional fluid to an already overloaded RV will further exacerbate RV dilation, potentially leading to a leftward shift of the interventricular septum, impairing left ventricular filling, and precipitating cardiogenic shock. The nurse must immediately notify the provider and respiratory therapist to facilitate interventions such as inotropic support (e.g., dobutamine) to improve RV contractility and pulmonary vasodilation (e.g., inhaled nitric oxide) to reduce RV afterload. Close monitoring of CVP and lactate is essential to assess the effectiveness of interventions and detect further deterioration.",
