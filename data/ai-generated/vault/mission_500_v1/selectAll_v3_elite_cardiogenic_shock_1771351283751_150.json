      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client is exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock, likely due to cardiac tamponade post-TAVR, evidenced by hypotension, jugular venous distension (JVD), muffled heart sounds, and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. The elevated lactate, BUN, and creatinine indicate end-organ hypoperfusion and acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to decreased cardiac output. Administering furosemide, a loop diuretic, would further reduce preload, exacerbating hypotension and potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. The priority is to address the underlying cause of the shock, not to reduce fluid volume. **Pathophysiology:** Cardiac tamponade restricts ventricular filling, reducing stroke volume and cardiac output. The body compensates by increasing heart rate (tachycardia). However, this compensatory mechanism eventually fails, leading to decreased blood pressure and inadequate tissue perfusion. Diuretics worsen this by decreasing preload.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Diuretics are contraindicated in hypotensive patients with suspected cardiac tamponade or other forms of obstructive shock. Always assess for signs of shock before administering diuretics."
    },
    "opt2": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, coupled with hypotension, JVD, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad), strongly suggests a post-procedural bleed leading to cardiac tamponade. Heparin, an anticoagulant, would exacerbate the bleeding and worsen the tamponade. Withholding heparin is a critical safety measure. **Pathophysiology:** Heparin inhibits the formation of new blood clots and prevents existing clots from growing larger. In the context of a post-TAVR bleed, this would impede the body's natural clotting mechanisms to stop the hemorrhage, leading to further blood accumulation in the pericardial sac and worsening tamponade.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always carefully review recent imaging and assess for signs of bleeding before administering anticoagulants, especially post-operatively."
    },
    "opt3": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is in decompensated cardiogenic shock, evidenced by severe hypotension (84/68 mmHg), tachycardia (128 bpm), hypoxemia (SpO2 90%), elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L), and signs of cardiac tamponade. The new LBBB could indicate myocardial ischemia or injury. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention by a multidisciplinary team. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) can provide advanced assessment, interventions, and facilitate transfer to a higher level of care if needed. **Pathophysiology:** Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's metabolic demands. In this case, cardiac tamponade is the likely cause, restricting ventricular filling and reducing cardiac output. The resulting hypoperfusion triggers a cascade of compensatory mechanisms, including increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, but these eventually fail, leading to organ damage and death if not promptly treated.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Early recognition of shock and prompt activation of the RRT are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Don't hesitate to call for help when a patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating."

    "opt4": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is hypoxic (SpO2 90%) and exhibiting signs of respiratory distress (RR 26). Increasing oxygen delivery to the highest possible concentration with a non-rebreather mask is a crucial immediate action to improve oxygen saturation and reduce the workload on the myocardium. Hypoxemia further compromises tissue perfusion and can exacerbate myocardial ischemia. **Pathophysiology:** Hypoxemia reduces the amount of oxygen available to the tissues, impairing cellular metabolism and leading to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactate. In the setting of cardiogenic shock, hypoxemia worsens myocardial ischemia and can further impair cardiac function.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always prioritize oxygenation in patients with shock. Titrate oxygen delivery to maintain an SpO2 of 94-99%, unless otherwise indicated."

    "opt5": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While high Fowler's position can be beneficial for patients with pulmonary edema, it can decrease venous return (preload). In a patient with hypotension due to cardiac tamponade, reducing preload could further compromise cardiac filling and worsen blood pressure. The patient may benefit from a supine position or having legs elevated to improve venous return until the underlying problem is addressed. **Pathophysiology:** Cardiac tamponade restricts ventricular filling, making preload essential for maintaining cardiac output. High Fowler's position decreases venous return to the heart, reducing preload and potentially worsening hypotension in a patient with tamponade.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid placing hypotensive patients in high Fowler's position, as this can further decrease blood pressure. Consider a supine position or Trendelenburg position to improve venous return."

    "opt6": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is hemodynamically unstable and will likely require aggressive resuscitation, which may include rapid administration of fluids, blood products, and multiple vasoactive infusions. Establishing a second reliable, large-bore IV access is a prudent anticipatory action for a client in shock. This ensures that medications and fluids can be administered quickly and efficiently. **Pathophysiology:** In cardiogenic shock, rapid administration of fluids and medications may be necessary to support blood pressure and improve cardiac output. Having multiple IV access points allows for simultaneous administration of different therapies without interruption.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always anticipate the need for multiple IV access points in patients with shock. Establishing a second IV early can save valuable time during resuscitation."
