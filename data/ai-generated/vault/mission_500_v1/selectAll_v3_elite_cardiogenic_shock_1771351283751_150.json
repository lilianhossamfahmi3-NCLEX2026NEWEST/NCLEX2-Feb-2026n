The client's clinical presentation (hypotension, narrowing pulse pressure, JVD, muffled heart sounds) strongly suggests obstructive shock from cardiac tamponade, not fluid overload heart failure.

The widened mediastinum on CXR is highly suggestive of a post-procedural bleed (e.g., aortic root or ventricular rupture) causing cardiac tamponade. Administering heparin, an anticoagulant, in this situation would be catastrophic and could lead to rapid exsanguination. The nurse must recognize this contraindication and withhold the medication."

The client is in decompensated cardiogenic/obstructive shock, evidenced by severe hypotension, tachycardia, end-organ hypoperfusion (low urine output, high lactate, AKI), and signs of cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad: hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds).
