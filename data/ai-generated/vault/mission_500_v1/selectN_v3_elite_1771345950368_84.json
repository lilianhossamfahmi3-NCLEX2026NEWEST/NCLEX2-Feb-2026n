The client's history of low ejection fraction (EF 30%) is a critical risk factor. The assessment findings of worsening tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, severe hypoxia, crackles, pink frothy sputum, and JVD are classic signs of flash pulmonary edema. The elevated troponin indicates acute myocardial injury from the extreme stress, and the rising lactate signifies worsening shock and tissue hypoperfusion despite the high fluid volume. The nurse's immediate priorities are to stop the intervention causing the harm (fluid overload), support oxygenation, and escalate care.",

The standard burn resuscitation protocol is contraindicated by the overwhelming evidence of acute cardiac failure. Treating the tachycardia with a beta-blocker in the setting of acute cardiogenic shock is life-threatening as it would further suppress myocardial contractility. Placing the client supine or in Trendelenburg would worsen the pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.",
