The client's pre-existing heart failure (EF 30%) significantly increases the risk. Findings such as worsening tachycardia (142 bpm), hypotension (88/50 mmHg), tachypnea (36 breaths/min), severe hypoxia (SpO2 86%), coarse crackles, pink frothy sputum, and jugular vein distention (JVD) are indicative of flash pulmonary edema. Elevated troponin (0.95 ng/mL) suggests myocardial injury due to stress and hypoxemia, while elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L) indicates worsening shock and tissue hypoperfusion. Immediate priorities include stopping the harmful intervention (fluid overload), maximizing oxygenation, and escalating care.",

The standard burn resuscitation protocol is contraindicated by the overwhelming evidence of acute cardiac failure.

Placing the client supine or in Trendelenburg would worsen the pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.",

Continuing the high infusion rate will worsen pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, potentially leading to respiratory arrest. The immediate priority is to reduce the volume load on the failing heart. **Pathophysiology:** The failing heart cannot effectively pump the large volume of fluid, leading to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, forcing fluid into the alveoli. **Clinical Pearl:** Always reassess and titrate fluid resuscitation based on patient response, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions.

In this case, the response is catastrophic fluid overload. Continuing the fluids would directly worsen the pulmonary edema and myocardial strain (evidenced by troponin leak), precipitating cardiovascular collapse. **Pathophysiology:** The Parkland formula aims to restore intravascular volume lost due to burn-induced capillary leak. However, in patients with impaired cardiac function, this volume can overwhelm the heart's ability to pump, leading to pulmonary edema. **Clinical Pearl:** The Parkland formula is a starting point, not a rigid prescription. Frequent reassessment and adjustment are crucial, especially in vulnerable populations."

The pink, frothy sputum confirms pulmonary edema, which impairs gas exchange. Maximizing oxygen delivery with a high-flow device is essential to prevent further cellular hypoxia and organ damage while other interventions are prepared. **Pathophysiology:** Pulmonary edema impairs gas exchange by increasing the diffusion distance between the alveoli and capillaries. This leads to hypoxemia and subsequent tissue hypoxia. A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen to maximize oxygen saturation. **Clinical Pearl:** In patients with pulmonary edema, high-flow oxygen is a temporizing measure. Positive pressure ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, intubation) may be required to improve oxygenation and ventilation."

Administering a beta-blocker (metoprolol) in acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock will decrease contractility, lower cardiac output, and profoundly worsen the hypotension, leading to cardiac arrest. **Pathophysiology:** Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that reduces heart rate and contractility. In cardiogenic shock, the heart is already struggling to pump effectively. Further reducing contractility can lead to a precipitous drop in cardiac output and blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure, especially when accompanied by hypotension or signs of shock."

          "justification": "This action would worsen the client's respiratory distress. Placing the client supine increases the pressure of the abdominal contents on the diaphragm and increases venous return to an already overloaded right ventricle. This would exacerbate the pulmonary edema. The correct position is high-Fowler's to facilitate breathing. **Pathophysiology:** Supine positioning increases venous return, further increasing preload on the already failing heart. This exacerbates pulmonary congestion. Elevating the legs increases venous return even further. **Clinical Pearl:** Positioning is a simple but powerful intervention. High-Fowler's position reduces preload and improves lung expansion in patients with pulmonary edema."

The client has experienced a life-threatening change in condition that requires urgent medical re-evaluation and new orders, such as for diuretics, positive pressure ventilation, and possibly inotropic support. The nurse must communicate these critical findings to the provider to facilitate a change in the plan of care. **Pathophysiology:** Prompt communication allows for timely interventions to address the underlying pathophysiology of ADHF and cardiogenic shock. Diuretics can reduce fluid overload, positive pressure ventilation can improve oxygenation, and inotropes can improve cardiac contractility. **Clinical Pearl:** SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) is a structured communication tool that ensures clear and concise information transfer between healthcare providers."
