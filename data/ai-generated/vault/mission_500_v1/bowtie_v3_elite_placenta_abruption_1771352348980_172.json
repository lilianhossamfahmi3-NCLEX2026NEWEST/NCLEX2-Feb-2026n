The client's partner states, 'She suddenly grabbed her belly an hour ago and screamed. She's been moaning and feels really dizzy.' The client reports constant, severe, 'knife-like' abdominal pain rated 10/10 and denies any recent trauma. She notes a small amount of dark red vaginal spotting on her underwear but no active flow.
