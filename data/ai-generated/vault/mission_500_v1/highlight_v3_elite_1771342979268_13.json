Ischemic penumbra, the salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct, is still viable within this timeframe. Thrombolysis aims to restore blood flow to this area, minimizing permanent damage.

The NIHSS assesses neurological deficits like consciousness, language, neglect, visual field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss.

        "justification": "Incorrect. Ruling out hemorrhage is a prerequisite for tPA. Hemorrhage on CT indicates a hemorrhagic stroke, where tPA is absolutely contraindicated. tPA is a thrombolytic, breaking down clots. In a hemorrhagic stroke, this would worsen bleeding, leading to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. Elevated blood pressure is a relative contraindication. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation after tPA administration. High pressure can cause weakened blood vessels in the infarcted area to rupture. Labetalol is used to lower BP to below 185/110 mmHg before tPA initiation. This is a safety stop."

An elevated INR (>1.7) would suggest impaired coagulation, increasing bleeding risk with tPA. tPA works by activating plasminogen to dissolve clots; pre-existing coagulopathy would exacerbate bleeding complications."

    "A non-contrast head CT is mandatory to exclude intracranial hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication.",
    "Treat elevated blood pressure with antihypertensives (e.g., labetalol) to achieve target BP before tPA infusion. Monitor BP closely during and after tPA.",
    "Thrombocytopenia significantly increases bleeding risk with tPA. Investigate the cause of thrombocytopenia and consider platelet transfusion if appropriate."
