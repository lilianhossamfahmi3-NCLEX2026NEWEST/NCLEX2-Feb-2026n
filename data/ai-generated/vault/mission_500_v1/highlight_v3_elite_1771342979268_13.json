        "correct": "The nurse must recognize two critical findings that are contraindications to the immediate administration of alteplase (tPA). First, the blood pressure of 189/108 mmHg is above the strict guideline threshold of 185/110 mmHg required for initiating thrombolysis. The elevated pressure must be lowered with antihypertensives (like the ordered labetalol) before tPA can be safely administered to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Second, and more definitively, the platelet count of 78,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ significantly increases the risk of severe, life-threatening intracranial and systemic bleeding. Therefore, the nurse must withhold the alteplase and immediately notify the provider of these findings. This situation represents a critical safety stop to prevent patient harm.",
