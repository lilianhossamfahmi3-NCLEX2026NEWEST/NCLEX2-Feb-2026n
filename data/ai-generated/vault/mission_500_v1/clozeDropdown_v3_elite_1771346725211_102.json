Her daughter reports a 3-day history of fever, chills, and painful urination. The client reports delaying care due to being the primary caregiver for her disabled spouse. \n\n**On Arrival (13:00):**\nLethargic, responds to painful stimuli. Skin is warm, flushed, and dry. Catheterized for a urine specimen; urine is cloudy and malodorous. Sepsis protocol initiated. \n\n**14:15 Update:**\n30 mL/kg normal saline bolus (2100 mL total) infused over 75 minutes. Piperacillin-tazobactam initiated after blood and urine cultures were obtained. Client is now more awake but remains confused. Noted to have increased respiratory effort. Auscultation reveals new-onset fine crackles in bilateral lung bases. A new S3 heart sound is audible on cardiac exam. Peripheral edema is 1+ bilaterally."

Instead of improving, the client's condition has worsened with signs of both fluid overload and myocardial injury. The new-onset crackles, S3 heart sound, worsening tachycardia, and falling oxygen saturation indicate acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and pulmonary edema. The markedly elevated high-sensitivity troponin (950 ng/L) confirms acute myocardial injury (Type 2 MI due to demand ischemia). This combination of findings indicates the client's shock is no longer purely distributive (septic) but now has a significant, life-threatening cardiogenic component. The nurse must recognize this critical change. The absolute priority is to withhold the planned intervention (norepinephrine), which may increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen ischemia, and immediately notify the provider of the new cardiac findings. This is a critical 'safety stop' moment where proceeding with the standard protocol without reassessment could be fatal.",

Proceeding with standard sepsis bundle elements without re-evaluating the patient's response can lead to iatrogenic harm, particularly in patients with cardiac comorbidities.
