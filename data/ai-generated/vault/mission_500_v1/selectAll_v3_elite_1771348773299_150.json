    "correct": "The client's presentation (rigid abdomen, dark red bleeding, FHR decelerations), vital sign trend (progressive tachycardia and hypotension), and laboratory results (low hemoglobin, platelets, and fibrinogen with elevated D-dimer) are classic signs of a severe placental abruption complicated by hemorrhagic shock and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). Placental abruption occurs when the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall, leading to hemorrhage. The release of tissue factor activates the coagulation cascade, resulting in the formation of microthrombi throughout the vasculature. This process consumes platelets and clotting factors, leading to DIC and an increased risk of bleeding. The nurse's priority actions must focus on resuscitation, communication of critical deterioration, and preparation for emergency delivery while avoiding actions that would worsen bleeding. Clinical Pearl: In placental abruption, rapid deterioration can occur. Anticipate and prepare for interventions simultaneously.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent critical safety errors. Administering an anticoagulant (enoxaparin) or performing a vaginal examination in a client with active, severe hemorrhage and DIC is absolutely contraindicated and could be fatal.

DIC is a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to depletion of clotting factors and subsequent hemorrhage. The client has an active, severe hemorrhage. Administering an anticoagulant like enoxaparin would inhibit any remaining clotting ability, leading to catastrophic, uncontrollable bleeding and likely death. Clinical Pearl: Never administer anticoagulants in the presence of active DIC.",

Hemorrhagic shock occurs due to significant blood loss, leading to decreased circulating volume and inadequate tissue perfusion. Establishing at least two large-bore IVs is essential for rapid administration of crystalloid fluids, blood products (PRBCs, FFP, platelets), and emergency medications as part of a massive transfusion protocol.

This information must be escalated immediately to the provider and the rapid response/obstetric emergency team to expedite the definitive treatment, which is an emergency Cesarean delivery and massive transfusion. SBAR: Situation: 34-year-old G2P1 at 37 weeks with suspected placental abruption and possible DIC. Background: Sudden onset abdominal pain, dark red bleeding, rigid uterus, fetal decelerations, declining vital signs, abnormal labs (low Hgb, platelets, fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer). Assessment: Client is unstable, showing signs of hemorrhagic shock and DIC. Recommendation: STAT C-section and massive transfusion protocol are needed.

O-negative is the universal donor, and its administration can begin immediately without waiting for a full crossmatch, which is critical in this emergency.

        "justification": "This is a correct intervention. The left lateral position displaces the gravid uterus off the inferior vena cava and aorta, which maximizes venous return to the heart, improves cardiac output, and enhances perfusion to the compromised fetus. Compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus can reduce venous return, leading to hypotension and decreased placental perfusion. Laying the HOB flat helps to treat the hypotension associated with shock. Clinical Pearl: Continuous fetal monitoring is essential to assess fetal response to maternal positioning.",
