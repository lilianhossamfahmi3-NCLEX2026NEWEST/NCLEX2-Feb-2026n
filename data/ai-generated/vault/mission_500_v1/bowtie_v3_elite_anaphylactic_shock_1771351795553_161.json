The client's rapid onset of hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, urticaria, wheezing, and subjective feeling of throat tightness immediately following exposure to a known allergen (IV contrast with an iodine allergy) are classic signs of anaphylactic shock. The elevated lactate also indicates tissue hypoperfusion consistent with distributive shock."

                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Cardiogenic shock is caused by pump failure. While hypotension and tachycardia are present, the normal troponin makes an acute MI unlikely. Furthermore, the presence of urticaria and wheezing points to a systemic allergic reaction, not a primary cardiac event."

            "cond3": {
                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Septic shock develops more slowly and is caused by a systemic infection. The client has a normal temperature and WBC count, and the symptoms had an abrupt onset immediately after an allergic trigger, not an infectious process."

            "cond4": {
                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Contrast-induced nephropathy is a delayed kidney injury that would manifest as a rise in creatinine over 24-72 hours. It does not cause acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and urticaria. The client's baseline creatinine is already slightly elevated, indicating a pre-existing risk."

                "correct": true,

Rapid administration of an isotonic IV fluid bolus, such as Normal Saline, is critical to restore intravascular volume and support blood pressure."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is contraindicated and represents a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' moment. The client's tachycardia is a compensatory response to severe hypotension. Administering a beta-blocker like metoprolol would block this response, leading to a catastrophic drop in cardiac output and blood pressure. It could also worsen bronchospasm. This action is life-threatening."

While diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) is used to treat anaphylaxis, it is a secondary treatment that addresses histamine-mediated symptoms like itching and urticaria. It does not treat the life-threatening hypotension or bronchospasm and should never be given before or instead of epinephrine."

            "act5": {
                "correct": false,

While establishing a second IV line is a good supportive action for fluid resuscitation, it is not as immediate as administering the life-saving medication (epinephrine) and starting the fluid bolus through the existing IV. The direct interventions to reverse the shock process take priority."

            "param4": {
                "correct": false,

This is evidenced by the acute onset of symptoms following exposure to a known allergen (iodine contrast), including hypotension (86/50 mmHg), compensatory tachycardia (138/min), hypoxia (SpO2 89%), airway compromise (wheezing, 'throat tight'), and cutaneous signs (urticaria). The elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L) confirms tissue hypoperfusion. The nurse's priority actions are to reverse the life-threatening pathophysiology. This requires immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine to cause vasoconstriction and bronchodilation, and starting a rapid IV fluid bolus to combat the distributive shock. It is critical for the nurse to recognize that administering the ordered metoprolol for the compensatory tachycardia is contraindicated and would cause severe harm by worsening hypotension and shock. The key parameters to monitor for improvement are blood pressure (to assess reversal of shock) and respiratory status/wheezing (to assess reversal of airway compromise)."
