            "correct": "The absolute contraindication for administering Alteplase (tPA) is the client's platelet count of 75,000/mm³. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ significantly increases the risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage, as platelets are essential for primary hemostasis and clot formation. Alteplase works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which lyses fibrin clots; administering this potent thrombolytic to a client with thrombocytopenia creates an unacceptably high risk of catastrophic bleeding.",
            "incorrect": "The other findings, while important, either support the administration of tPA or are not contraindications. The blood pressure has been successfully lowered to below the 185/110 mmHg threshold. The NIHSS score of 12 indicates a moderate stroke, which is a clear indication for tPA. The non-contrast head CT confirming no hemorrhage is a prerequisite for administration. The INR is well within the acceptable range (<1.7). Recognizing the low platelet count is a critical safety stop to prevent iatrogenic harm.",

                    "justification": "This blood pressure is not a contraindication. Thrombolytic therapy can be administered if the systolic blood pressure is maintained below 185 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is maintained below 110 mmHg. The vital signs trend shows that the blood pressure, though initially elevated, has responded to Labetalol and is now within the acceptable range for tPA administration."

                    "justification": "An NIHSS score of 12 indicates a moderate stroke deficit and is a strong indication FOR, not against, administering tPA. The goal is to reverse or minimize the neurological deficit. Very low scores (e.g., <4) or rapidly improving symptoms may be relative contraindications, but a score of 12 warrants aggressive treatment."

                    "isCorrect": true,
                    "justification": "This is the correct finding to highlight. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for Alteplase administration. Thrombocytopenia severely impairs the body's ability to form a primary platelet plug at sites of injury. Administering a powerful thrombolytic in this state would create a profound risk of spontaneous and uncontrollable bleeding, particularly life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage."
