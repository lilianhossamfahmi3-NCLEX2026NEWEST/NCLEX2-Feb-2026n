      "correct": "The client's platelet count of 75,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for Alteplase (tPA) administration. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ significantly elevates the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are crucial for primary hemostasis. They adhere to damaged blood vessel walls and aggregate to form a platelet plug, initiating the clotting cascade. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) impairs this process. Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, converts plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In a client with thrombocytopenia, administering Alteplase can lead to uncontrolled bleeding because the body lacks sufficient platelets to form clots and stop the bleeding. The nurse must immediately notify the provider to withhold the medication and discuss alternative treatment strategies to mitigate the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.",
      "incorrect": "The other findings, while important, either support the administration of tPA or are not contraindications. The blood pressure has been successfully lowered to below the 185/110 mmHg threshold. The NIHSS score of 12 indicates a moderate stroke, which is a clear indication for tPA. The non-contrast head CT confirming no hemorrhage is a prerequisite for administration. The INR is well within the acceptable range (<1.7). Recognizing the low platelet count is a critical safety measure to prevent iatrogenic harm.",

          "content": "BP 178/102, HR 88",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "This blood pressure is not a contraindication. Thrombolytic therapy can be administered if the systolic blood pressure is maintained below 185 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is maintained below 110 mmHg. Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of bleeding during thrombolysis. The vital signs trend shows that the blood pressure, though initially elevated, has responded to Labetalol and is now within the acceptable range for tPA administration. The priority is to control hypertension to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion after tPA administration. The current BP is acceptable."

          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "An NIHSS score of 12 indicates a moderate stroke deficit and is a strong indication FOR, not against, administering tPA. The NIHSS quantifies the severity of neurological deficits. Higher scores indicate more severe deficits. The goal is to reverse or minimize the neurological deficit. Very low scores (e.g., <4) or rapidly improving symptoms may be relative contraindications, but a score of 12 warrants aggressive treatment to improve patient outcomes."

          "justification": "An International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 1.1 is within the normal therapeutic range for a person not on anticoagulants. The threshold for withholding tPA is typically an INR greater than 1.7. An elevated INR indicates impaired coagulation, increasing the risk of bleeding. This result indicates normal coagulation and is not a contraindication to tPA administration."

          "justification": "This is the correct finding to highlight. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for Alteplase administration. Thrombocytopenia severely impairs the body's ability to form a primary platelet plug at sites of injury. Administering a powerful thrombolytic in this state would create a profound risk of spontaneous and uncontrollable bleeding, particularly life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The priority is to prevent harm from bleeding."

          "justification": "This finding is a critical prerequisite that MUST be confirmed before tPA can be given. It rules out a hemorrhagic stroke, for which tPA would be fatal. tPA is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke because it would exacerbate the bleeding. Therefore, this finding SUPPORTS the decision to give tPA, it is not a reason to withhold it. The CT scan is essential to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke."
