Client is agitated, confused to time and place, and repeatedly asking, 'Where am I?'. Tachypneic and states, 'I can't catch my breath.' A fine, non-blanching petechial rash is noted across the chest, axillae, and conjunctivae."

The ABG confirms severe hypoxemia (PaO2 55 mmHg) despite hyperventilation (low PaCO2). The CBC shows thrombocytopenia (platelets 95,000/mm³). The nurse must recognize this as a life-threatening emergency and take immediate action to support oxygenation while withholding any interventions that could worsen the client's condition.",

Administering contraindicated medications or fluids can accelerate respiratory failure and increase mortality.

Administering an anticoagulant like enoxaparin significantly increases the risk of bleeding, particularly dangerous if cerebral petechiae progress to hemorrhage.
