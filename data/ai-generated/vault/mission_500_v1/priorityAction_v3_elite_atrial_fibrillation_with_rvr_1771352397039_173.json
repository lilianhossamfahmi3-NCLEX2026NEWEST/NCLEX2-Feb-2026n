        "condition": {
            "c1": "Correct. The client's clinical presentation strongly indicates decompensated heart failure leading to early cardiogenic shock. The rapid, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation has impaired ventricular filling, reducing cardiac output. This is evidenced by the falling blood pressure (88/52 mmHg), crackles in the lungs, pulmonary congestion on CXR, cool/pale skin, rising lactate (3.8 mmol/L), and elevated BUN/Creatinine, all pointing to systemic hypoperfusion and fluid backup.",
            "c2": "Incorrect. The client is showing signs of fluid volume overload (crackles, edema, pulmonary congestion), not deficit. Hypovolemic shock would be characterized by signs of dehydration and would not present with lung crackles.",
            "c3": "Incorrect. While the elevated BUN and Creatinine do indicate an acute kidney injury, this is a consequence of the primary problem, which is poor perfusion from cardiac decompensation. The AKI is not the root cause of the hemodynamic instability.",
            "c4": "Incorrect. While a pulmonary embolism can cause tachycardia and shortness of breath, the constellation of findings (pulmonary congestion on CXR, crackles, known A-fib) makes decompensated heart failure a much more likely primary diagnosis. The core issue is cardiac pump failure.",
            "c5": "Incorrect. The client's deterioration is a direct result of the pathophysiology of A-fib with RVR, not an adverse reaction to a medication he has received. The problem is the disease process itself, which is now creating a contraindication for the prescribed medication."
        },
        "action": {
            "a1": "Incorrect. This is a life-threatening error. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker with negative inotropic (decreases contractility) and chronotropic (decreases heart rate) effects. Administering it to a client who is hypotensive (BP 88/52) and showing signs of cardiogenic shock will further decrease cardiac output and blood pressure, potentially causing cardiovascular collapse.",
            "a2": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, they are also in a state of fluid overload as evidenced by lung crackles and pulmonary congestion. Administering an IV fluid bolus would worsen the pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. This client's hypotension is due to pump failure, not a volume deficit.",
            "a3": "Correct. This is the critical safety action. The nurse must recognize that the client's hemodynamic instability (severe hypotension, signs of shock) is a clear contraindication for the ordered metoprolol. The priority is to withhold the dangerous medication and immediately notify the provider of the client's critical change in status. The treatment plan must be re-evaluated, possibly considering electrical cardioversion or alternative medications like amiodarone or vasopressors.",
            "a4": "Incorrect. While increasing the oxygen is a reasonable supportive measure for the client's hypoxia (SpO2 90%), it is not the most appropriate *priority* action. The most critical action is to prevent the harm that would be caused by administering the metoprolol. Treating the hypoxia does not resolve the underlying hemodynamic collapse or prevent the iatrogenic injury.",
            "a5": "Incorrect. While cardioversion may ultimately be required, preparing the client for it is not the nurse's first independent action. The immediate priority is recognizing the contraindication, withholding the unsafe medication, and communicating with the provider who will make the decision for cardioversion."
