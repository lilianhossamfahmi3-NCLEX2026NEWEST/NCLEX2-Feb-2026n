ARDS pathophysiology involves alveolar damage, leading to pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange. Increasing FiO2 maximizes the oxygen gradient, driving more oxygen into the blood. Clinical Pearl: High FiO2 can cause oxygen toxicity, so it's a temporary measure. Monitor closely and titrate down as able."

        "justification": "The client's hypotension (BP 84/48) and elevated lactate (4.1 mmol/L) indicate shock. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance, improving blood pressure. In ARDS, hypotension can result from sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects. Norepinephrine helps counteract vasodilation and improve perfusion. Clinical Pearl: Ensure adequate IV access before increasing vasopressors. Monitor for signs of tissue ischemia."

        "justification": "A repeat ABG and lactate are needed to evaluate the client's response to interventions and guide further treatment. The ABG assesses oxygenation (PaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-base balance (pH). Lactate reflects tissue perfusion and anaerobic metabolism. In ARDS, these values help determine the severity of respiratory failure and shock. Clinical Pearl: Document the FiO2 and ventilator settings at the time of ABG draw for accurate interpretation."

The client has been intubated for a day, and the gradual decline suggests worsening ARDS rather than acute tube displacement. However, it should still be assessed. Malposition can cause unilateral lung ventilation, leading to hypoxemia. Clinical Pearl: Confirm ETT placement with end-tidal CO2 and chest x-ray after intubation. Auscultate breath sounds bilaterally."
