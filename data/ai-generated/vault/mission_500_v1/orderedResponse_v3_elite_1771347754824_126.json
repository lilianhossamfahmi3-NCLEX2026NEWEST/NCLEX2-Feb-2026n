The nurse must first recognize the contraindication to administering the scheduled furosemide, as it would worsen the shock state by causing further vasodilation and volume depletion. The priority is to address the immediate life-threats. The correct sequence is: 1) Maximize oxygenation as an immediate, independent nursing action. 2) Immediately communicate the critical situation to the interprofessional team. 3) Prepare for the next logical step in hemodynamic resuscitation. 4) Obtain labs to evaluate the client's response and guide further therapy. 5) Perform a secondary assessment/safety check that is important but not as time-sensitive as the initial resuscitation efforts.",

Increasing the FiO2 to 100% is a critical first step to maximize arterial oxygen saturation and tissue oxygen delivery while other interventions are initiated.

A clear SBAR report is essential for timely and effective team-based intervention."

A repeat ABG and lactate are essential to quantify the severity of the respiratory and metabolic failure and to evaluate the client's response to the initial interventions (like increasing FiO2).

                "justification": "This is an important assessment and safety check, but it is the lowest priority among these options. An acute tube dislodgement would typically present with more dramatic signs (e.g., absent breath sounds, ventilator alarms for low pressure/volume). While it should be part of the overall assessment, the existing data (bilateral opacities, gradual decline) points more towards a physiological decompensation (worsening ARDS/shock) rather than an acute airway event. The other actions are more directly aimed at resuscitating the client from the current state of shock and hypoxemia."
