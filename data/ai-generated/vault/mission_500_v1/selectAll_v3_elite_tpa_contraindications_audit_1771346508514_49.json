A review of that visit's record indicates he was diagnosed with multiple contusions and a Grade II liver laceration, which was deemed stable for non-operative management. He was discharged to a local shelter with follow-up instructions but did not attend his appointment."

Significant internal trauma, such as a liver laceration, within the past 3 weeks poses an extremely high risk of life-threatening hemorrhage if a thrombolytic agent is administered. The nurse has a duty to recognize this 'Safety Stop' moment, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider."

While the blood pressure is technically below the absolute contraindication threshold of 185/110 mmHg, it is precariously close. Guidelines require that blood pressure be safely and consistently maintained below this level before and during tPA infusion. A reading of 180/105 mmHg, despite an initial dose of labetalol, indicates potential instability and a high risk of reperfusion hemorrhage. This finding requires the nurse to pause, contact the provider for potential further BP management, and not proceed with administration until the pressure is more stable and well-controlled."

This client's platelet count of 110,000/mm³ is above this critical threshold and, by itself, is not a reason to withhold alteplase. This option tests for precise knowledge of laboratory value cutoffs."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "justification": "This finding is the primary indication for administering alteplase, not a contraindication. The absence of hemorrhage on the CT scan confirms the stroke is ischemic, making the client a potential candidate for thrombolytic therapy."

        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "justification": "A last known well time of 2 hours is well within the standard 3 to 4.5-hour therapeutic window for alteplase administration. This finding supports the decision to treat, rather than withhold, the medication."

        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "justification": "The client's housing status is a significant social determinant of health that impacts their overall care, history, and discharge plan. However, it is not a direct physiological contraindication to the acute administration of alteplase for an ischemic stroke. The nurse must focus on the immediate clinical safety parameters."
