      "isCorrect": true,
      "justification": "Correct. A Grade II liver laceration within the past 3 weeks is an absolute contraindication to tPA administration due to the high risk of potentially fatal hemorrhage. The liver is a highly vascular organ, and even a seemingly stable laceration can become a source of significant bleeding with thrombolytic therapy. tPA works by dissolving clots, but it also interferes with the body's natural clotting mechanisms, increasing the risk of bleeding from any source. The nurse must immediately withhold the medication and notify the provider. Clinical Pearl: Always meticulously review the patient's history for recent trauma or surgery before administering tPA. Scoring: +1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Always meticulously review the patient's history for recent trauma or surgery before administering tPA.",
      "pathophysiology": "tPA activates plasminogen, converting it to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin, the main component of blood clots. This fibrinolysis can disrupt the hemostatic balance, leading to increased bleeding risk, especially in areas of recent trauma or surgery where the body is still attempting to form clots for healing."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "justification": "Correct. While the blood pressure (BP) is below the absolute contraindication of >185/110 mmHg, it remains elevated despite labetalol administration. tPA administration requires strict BP control to minimize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of reperfusion injury and bleeding into the infarcted area. The provider must be notified for further BP management before proceeding with tPA. Clinical Pearl: Maintain BP <185/110 mmHg prior to and during tPA infusion. Scoring: +1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Maintain BP <185/110 mmHg prior to and during tPA infusion.",
      "pathophysiology": "Elevated BP increases the pressure gradient across damaged blood vessels in the ischemic area. This increased pressure can lead to rupture of these weakened vessels, resulting in hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke. tPA further exacerbates this risk by dissolving existing clots and potentially exposing previously occluded, but fragile, vessels to high pressure."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "justification": "Incorrect. A platelet count of 110,000/mm³ is not a contraindication to tPA. The contraindication threshold is a platelet count <100,000/mm³. While a low platelet count increases bleeding risk, this client's value is within an acceptable range for tPA administration. Scoring: -1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "The platelet count contraindication for tPA is <100,000/mm³.",
      "pathophysiology": "Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) impairs the body's ability to form blood clots. Platelets are essential for primary hemostasis, the initial step in stopping bleeding. With insufficient platelets, even minor vessel damage can lead to prolonged or excessive bleeding. tPA further compounds this risk by interfering with fibrin clot formation."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "justification": "Incorrect. Early ischemic changes on a non-contrast CT scan are an indication for tPA administration, not a contraindication. The absence of hemorrhage on the CT scan is crucial to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before administering tPA. Scoring: -1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "A non-contrast CT scan is essential to rule out hemorrhage before tPA administration.",
      "pathophysiology": "Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain, leading to oxygen deprivation and cell death. Early ischemic changes on CT scan indicate the presence of an ischemic area without evidence of bleeding. tPA aims to restore blood flow to this ischemic area by dissolving the clot, thereby salvaging potentially viable brain tissue."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "justification": "Incorrect. A last known well (LKW) time of 2 hours is within the approved treatment window (typically 3-4.5 hours) for tPA administration. This supports the decision to administer tPA, assuming no other contraindications exist. Scoring: -1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "The standard treatment window for tPA is typically 3-4.5 hours from last known well.",
      "pathophysiology": "The longer the brain is deprived of oxygen due to an ischemic stroke, the greater the extent of irreversible brain damage. tPA is most effective when administered as early as possible after stroke onset to minimize the amount of brain tissue that is permanently damaged. The treatment window reflects the balance between the potential benefits of restoring blood flow and the risks of bleeding complications."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "justification": "Incorrect. While the client's unhoused status is a significant social determinant of health and may impact long-term care, it is not a direct contraindication to acute tPA administration. The nurse must prioritize physiological safety parameters in this acute situation. Scoring: -1 for selecting this option.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Focus on physiological parameters when assessing tPA eligibility.",
      "pathophysiology": "Social determinants of health, such as housing status, can indirectly affect health outcomes by influencing access to care, adherence to treatment, and overall health status. However, in the acute setting of stroke management, the immediate focus is on addressing the physiological derangements caused by the stroke and minimizing further brain damage."
