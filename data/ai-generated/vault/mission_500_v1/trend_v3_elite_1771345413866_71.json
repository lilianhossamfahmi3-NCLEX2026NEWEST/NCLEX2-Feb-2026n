The critically low platelet count (42,000/mm³) indicates severe thrombocytopenia, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Elevated liver enzymes (AST 254 U/L, ALT 198 U/L) suggest liver damage. Severe epigastric pain is often associated with liver capsule distention or rupture in HELLP syndrome. Ketorolac, an NSAID, is contraindicated due to its antiplatelet effects, which could exacerbate bleeding risk in a client with thrombocytopenia. The nurse must withhold the ketorolac and immediately notify the provider to report the client's condition and advocate for further evaluation and management, which may include emergency delivery. The elevated blood pressure and serum creatinine are expected findings in severe preeclampsia but do not represent the immediate threat posed by the thrombocytopenia and potential for hemorrhage. Magnesium sulfate is a standard treatment for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia.",
