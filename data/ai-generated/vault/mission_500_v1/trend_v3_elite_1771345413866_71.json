Client mentions she 'had to miss a few' prenatal appointments recently due to transportation issues and not wanting to bother her family.\n\n0800: Client reports headache is slightly worse and epigastric pain is now 'sharp and constant,' rating it 9/10. States she feels 'extremely nauseous.' Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with 1 beat of clonus. No vaginal bleeding noted."

The combination of critically low platelets (thrombocytopenia < 50,000/mm³), severely elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), and worsening epigastric pain (indicative of liver capsule distention) signals an impending risk of hepatic rupture and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The PRN order for Ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), must be withheld. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation, which would be catastrophic in a client with severe thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Therefore, the nurse's priority safety action is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately contact the provider to report the client's critical deterioration and advocate for urgent intervention, likely an emergency delivery.",

A platelet count below 50,000/mm³ is a critical finding that dramatically increases the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.
