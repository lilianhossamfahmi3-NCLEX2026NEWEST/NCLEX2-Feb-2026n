Client is <phrase id='phrase-1'>lethargic but oriented to person and place</phrase>. Reports <phrase id='phrase-2'>severe right flank pain</phrase> and notes his <phrase id='phrase-3'>urine output has been 'very low' for 2 days</phrase>. History of poorly controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes; client states it is difficult to get to appointments regularly due to transportation barriers. The provider has ordered a <phrase id='phrase-4'>CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast</phrase> to rule out a renal abscess. The client is scheduled to be transported to radiology in 30 minutes. <phrase id='phrase-5'>Urine output for the last 4 hours is 50 mL</phrase>. <phrase id='phrase-6'>Current vital signs are stable</phrase>. The client is <phrase id='phrase-7'>receiving Lactated Ringer's at 125 mL/hr</phrase> and piperacillin-tazobactam. Recent laboratory results have been reviewed.",
