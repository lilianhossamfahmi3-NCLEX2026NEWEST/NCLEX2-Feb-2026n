      "stem": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 68-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and type 2 diabetes. The client reports increasing muscle weakness, palpitations, and nausea over the past 24 hours. The client states he 'couldn't get a ride' to his last two scheduled hemodialysis appointments. The nurse reviews the electronic health record. Click to highlight the single finding that is most critical and requires immediate intervention before proceeding with other ordered treatments.",

    "rationale": {
      "correct": "The sine wave pattern on the ECG is a pre-terminal rhythm indicating severe, life-threatening hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity. In hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes. This depolarization inactivates voltage-gated sodium channels, slowing conduction velocity and prolonging the QRS complex. As hyperkalemia worsens, the P waves flatten and disappear, and the QRS complex widens further, eventually merging with the T wave to form a sine wave pattern. This pattern signifies a critical threshold where the heart is at imminent risk of ventricular fibrillation or asystole due to impaired repolarization and excitability. The nurse's priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane with IV calcium gluconate to counteract the effects of hyperkalemia on the myocardium. This action must precede other interventions aimed at lowering serum potassium, as they are slower to take effect and do not address the immediate electrical instability.",
      "incorrect": "While other findings are critical pieces of the clinical picture, they do not represent the same immediate threat to life as the sine wave ECG pattern. The high potassium level is the cause, and the missed dialysis is a contributing factor, but the ECG finding is the life-threatening *effect* that must be addressed in seconds to minutes. Delaying cardiac membrane stabilization to address other issues constitutes a failure to rescue.",

          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "This information explains the etiology of the hyperkalemia and is a crucial part of the patient's history. It highlights the impact of social determinants of health (lack of transportation) on adherence to treatment. However, it is historical data and does not represent the immediate physiological threat that requires intervention within seconds. Addressing the underlying cause is important, but not the priority in this acute crisis."

          "content": "Potassium: 8.1 mEq/L",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "This is a critically high potassium level and is the direct cause of the patient's life-threatening condition. The elevated potassium disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to the ECG changes. However, the laboratory value itself is not the ultimate priority for intervention. The priority is the *effect* of the hyperkalemia on the heart, as evidenced by the ECG. Two different patients could have a potassium of 8.1 mEq/L; one with only peaked T-waves and one with a sine wave pattern. The latter is in imminent danger of cardiac arrest, making the ECG the more critical action point."

          "isCorrect": true,
          "justification": "CORRECT. This is the 'SAFETY STOP' finding. A sine wave pattern is a classic, pre-arrest ECG manifestation of severe hyperkalemia. It indicates profound cardiac membrane instability and an immediate risk of hemodynamic collapse. The nurse must recognize this as a signal to stop and immediately administer the ordered IV Calcium Gluconate to stabilize the myocardium before any other action is taken. The calcium works by increasing the threshold potential, making the cardiac cells less excitable and reducing the risk of dysrhythmias."

          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "This medication is an appropriate part of the overall treatment plan as it removes potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract by exchanging sodium ions for potassium ions in the colon. However, its onset of action is hours, making it completely inadequate for this acute, life-threatening emergency. Highlighting this order as the most critical finding would demonstrate a misunderstanding of treatment priorities and timelines in a hyperkalemic crisis."
