Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K-dependent synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) in the liver. Giving more warfarin would further impair the clotting cascade and worsen the bleeding. This action directly contradicts the principle of 'SAFETY STOP' by potentially causing further harm.",

The client's symptoms (new-onset flank pain, dizziness, pallor, hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit) strongly suggest a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, a serious complication of anticoagulation. Warfarin's mechanism of action is to inhibit the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, prolonging the clotting time. The priority is to withhold further anticoagulation to prevent further bleeding and immediately notify the healthcare provider. This allows for prompt evaluation, diagnosis (likely via CT scan), and management, which may include reversal of anticoagulation with vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), and potentially blood transfusions. This action aligns with the 'SAFETY STOP' principle by preventing further harm.",
