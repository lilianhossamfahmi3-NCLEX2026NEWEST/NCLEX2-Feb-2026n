Alteplase (tPA) lyses clots but also significantly increases the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. An absolute contraindication for tPA administration is thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count below 100,000/mm³. This client's platelet count is 88,000/mm³, which poses an unacceptably high risk of intracranial hemorrhage if tPA is given. The nurse's independent, priority action is to recognize this 'killer' contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately communicate this critical finding to the provider/stroke team. This action prevents a potentially fatal medication error.",
