    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of severe lithium toxicity, a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. The elevated lithium level of 2.8 mEq/L (therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), coupled with neurological manifestations (confusion, ataxia, coarse tremors, slurred speech), cardiovascular effects (bradycardia, hypotension, T-wave flattening), and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine), indicates a critical state. The client's switch from furosemide (a loop diuretic) to hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) likely precipitated the toxicity. Thiazide diuretics increase lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, leading to decreased lithium clearance and elevated serum levels. Additionally, the client's hyponatremia (Na+ 132 mEq/L) further exacerbates lithium toxicity by promoting lithium reabsorption in the kidneys. The nurse must prioritize actions to halt further lithium absorption, enhance lithium excretion, and provide supportive care to prevent life-threatening complications such as seizures, cardiovascular collapse, and irreversible neurological damage (SILENT - Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity).",
    "incorrect": "Failure to recognize and address the signs and symptoms of severe lithium toxicity can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Administering more lithium or lisinopril would exacerbate the toxicity, potentially leading to seizures, coma, and permanent neurological damage. Delaying IV fluids, seizure precautions, or preparation for hemodialysis would fail to address the life-threatening complications of severe toxicity, including seizures, cardiovascular collapse, and permanent neurologic sequelae. The client's clinical presentation and laboratory values necessitate immediate and aggressive intervention to prevent irreversible organ damage and death.",

Administering another dose of lithium would further increase the toxic load, exacerbating neurological, cardiovascular, and renal dysfunction. This could lead to life-threatening complications such as seizures, coma, and cardiac arrhythmias. The priority is to halt further lithium absorption and promote its excretion."

        "rationale": "Indicated. Severe lithium toxicity can cause significant neurotoxicity, manifesting as confusion, ataxia, slurred speech, and tremors. These symptoms can progress to seizures and coma. Implementing seizure precautions, such as padding the side rails and having suction equipment readily available, is crucial to ensure the client's safety. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., every 1-2 hours) are necessary to monitor for changes in the client's level of consciousness, motor function, and seizure activity, allowing for timely intervention."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Indicated. The client is hyponatremic (Na+ 132 mEq/L) and has an acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine), likely due to dehydration and the toxic effects of lithium on the kidneys. Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) helps restore intravascular volume, correct hyponatremia, and promote renal excretion of lithium. Hyponatremia increases lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, worsening toxicity. Restoring sodium levels helps reduce lithium reabsorption and facilitates its elimination from the body. The bolus should be administered cautiously over 2-4 hours to avoid fluid overload, especially given the client's bradycardia and potential for cardiac compromise."

Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which can decrease glomerular filtration rate and increase lithium reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby reducing lithium clearance and increasing serum levels. Administering lisinopril to a client with pre-existing lithium toxicity and acute kidney injury would exacerbate both conditions, potentially leading to further renal damage and worsening lithium toxicity. ACE inhibitors should be avoided in patients with lithium toxicity."

Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity, especially in the presence of significant neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia), renal failure (creatinine 2.2 mg/dL), and a lithium level >2.5 mEq/L. Hemodialysis rapidly removes lithium from the body, preventing further organ damage and improving the client's prognosis. The nurse must anticipate this order and prepare the client by ensuring vascular access is available, gathering necessary supplies, and educating the client and family about the procedure."
