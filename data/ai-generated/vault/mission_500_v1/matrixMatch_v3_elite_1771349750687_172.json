The critical lithium level of 2.8 mEq/L, coupled with neurologic signs (confusion, ataxia, coarse tremors), cardiovascular signs (bradycardia, hypotension, ECG changes), and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Creatinine), necessitates immediate intervention to prevent irreversible organ damage or death. The toxicity was likely precipitated by the client switching from furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), which significantly reduces renal clearance of lithium, and the concurrent hyponatremia. The nurse's primary responsibility is to 'STOP' any action that could worsen the toxicity and 'PROCEED' with interventions aimed at excretion of the drug and supportive care. This includes withholding lithium and other nephrotoxic/lithium-retaining drugs (like ACE inhibitors), initiating safety measures for neurologic compromise, restoring fluid and electrolyte balance to promote renal excretion, and anticipating advanced interventions like hemodialysis for severe cases.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the constellation of symptoms as severe lithium toxicity creates a significant risk of patient harm. Administering more lithium or lisinopril would be a catastrophic medication error, directly worsening the toxic state. Delaying IV fluids, seizure precautions, or preparation for hemodialysis would fail to address the life-threatening complications of severe toxicity, including seizures, cardiovascular collapse, and permanent neurologic sequelae (SILENT: syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity).",
