The client was found unresponsive at a community center; bystander CPR was initiated, but the first shock was delayed due to lack of an on-site AED. Per EMS report, the initial rhythm was Ventricular Fibrillation. Client achieved ROSC in the emergency department after 3 defibrillations, epinephrine, and amiodarone 300 mg IV push. He is now intubated and sedated on a propofol infusion. Hemodynamically supported with a norepinephrine infusion. Suspected cause is an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)."

        "correct": "The combination of a severely prolonged QTc interval (>500 ms), hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), and a scheduled dose of amiodarone represents a critical safety risk. Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic that works by prolonging the cardiac action potential and, consequently, the QT interval. Administering it to a patient who already has a prolonged QTc, further exacerbated by hypokalemia, creates a high-risk scenario for developing Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The nurse's priority is to recognize this 'perfect storm' for a lethal arrhythmia, withhold the amiodarone, and immediately notify the provider to discuss an alternative treatment plan and prioritize potassium repletion.",
        "incorrect": "This question requires the nurse to synthesize multiple data points (ECG, labs, MAR) to identify a life-threatening medication contraindication. Highlighting individual findings without recognizing their combined effect is incorrect. Hypotension and elevated troponin are expected in a post-arrest STEMI patient and do not contraindicate amiodarone. The potassium chloride infusion is a necessary intervention, not a medication to withhold. The delay in defibrillation explains the patient's poor neurological and metabolic state but does not directly contraindicate the specific medication.",

                "justification": "This is the primary contraindication. A QTc > 500 ms is considered severely prolonged and is a major risk factor for Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Administering a QT-prolonging drug like amiodarone is extremely dangerous and constitutes a 'safety stop' event."
