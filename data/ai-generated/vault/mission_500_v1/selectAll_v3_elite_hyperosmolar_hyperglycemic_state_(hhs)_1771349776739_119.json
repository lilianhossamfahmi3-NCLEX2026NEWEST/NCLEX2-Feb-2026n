The neighbor reports the client lost his job two months ago, has had difficulty affording medications, and has had vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days. Client is lethargic, arouses to painful stimuli, not oriented to time or place. Skin is warm, dry, with poor turgor. Mucous membranes are dry.\n\n0800 (ICU): Client admitted to ICU. Two liters of 0.9% sodium chloride have been infused since admission. A regular insulin infusion was initiated at 0700. Client remains lethargic, oriented only to person.

The combination of IV fluids and insulin has shifted potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, causing the serum potassium to drop from a low-normal 3.6 mEq/L to a critical 2.4 mEq/L. This is confirmed by the ECG changes (flattened T-waves, prominent U waves, PVCs), which indicate severe cardiac muscle irritability and a high risk for lethal arrhythmias. The client's worsening vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension) are likely due to cardiac instability from hypokalemia rather than just hypovolemia. The nurse's immediate priority is to stop the cause of the potassium shift (insulin) and urgently correct the potassium deficit to prevent cardiac arrest.",
