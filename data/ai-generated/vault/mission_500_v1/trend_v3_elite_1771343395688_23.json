The lab result shows a potassium level of 2.4 mEq/L, which is critically low. This is corroborated by the ECG findings of flattened T-waves and prominent U waves. The primary driver of this potassium drop is the insulin infusion, which shifts potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells. Continuing or increasing the insulin infusion at this point would worsen the hypokalemia, potentially inducing fatal cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, the absolute priority is to stop the factor causing the problem (insulin infusion), correct the life-threatening electrolyte imbalance (administer potassium), and implement critical safety monitoring (cardiac monitor). This is a classic 'SAFETY STOP' scenario where the nurse must recognize a contraindication to a standing order and intervene to prevent iatrogenic harm.",
