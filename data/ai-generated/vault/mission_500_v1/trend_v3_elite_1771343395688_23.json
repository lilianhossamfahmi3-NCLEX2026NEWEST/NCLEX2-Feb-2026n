This hypokalemia is likely exacerbated by the insulin infusion, which drives potassium intracellularly. Continuing the insulin infusion poses a significant risk of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, the priority actions are to immediately stop the insulin infusion to prevent further potassium shifts, administer the prescribed IV potassium chloride to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and initiate continuous cardiac monitoring to detect and manage any arrhythmias. This scenario highlights a crucial 'SAFETY STOP' where the nurse must recognize a contraindication to a standing order to prevent iatrogenic harm.",

Administering potassium is essential to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent dysrhythmias.",
        "pathophysiology": "Potassium is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes.
