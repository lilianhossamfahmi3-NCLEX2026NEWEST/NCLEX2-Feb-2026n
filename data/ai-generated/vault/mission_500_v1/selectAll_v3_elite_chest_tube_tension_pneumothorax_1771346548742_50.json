A right subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) was placed at 1300 for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Post-procedure chest x-ray revealed a right-sided pneumothorax. A 28-French chest tube was inserted in the emergency department at 1345 and connected to a water seal drainage system with suction at -20 cm H2O. The client reported immediate relief of dyspnea.\n\n**1430:** Called to the client's room for acute respiratory distress. Client is extremely anxious, diaphoretic, and grabbing at their chest. States, \"I can't breathe.\" Notable tracheal deviation to the left side. Right side of chest has no audible breath sounds. Distended neck veins are present. The chest tube drainage system shows no tidaling in the water seal chamber and no air leak bubbling. Dressings are dry and intact."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's anxiety is a symptom of severe hypoxia and hemodynamic collapse, not the root cause. Administering a benzodiazepine like lorazepam is extremely dangerous as it will cause respiratory depression and sedation, further compromising the client's already failing respiratory drive and potentially leading to respiratory arrest. This action would be a critical safety error."

            "rationale": "Correct. The combination of acute distress, absent tidaling in the water seal chamber, and signs of tension pneumothorax (hypotension, tachycardia, tracheal deviation) strongly suggests an obstruction in the chest tube system. Air is entering the pleural space but cannot escape, causing the tension. An immediate check for kinks, clamps, or external obstructions is a critical first troubleshooting step the nurse can perform independently while calling for help."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The problem is not insufficient suction, but a complete obstruction preventing air from escaping the chest. Increasing the suction will have no effect if the tube is kinked or occluded and wastes critical time. The priority is to re-establish patency of the drainage system or prepare for emergent decompression."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing a life-threatening tension pneumothorax leading to obstructive shock (evidenced by tachycardia, profound hypotension, JVD, and tracheal deviation). This is a medical emergency requiring immediate physician intervention and specialized team support. Activating the RRT and notifying the provider are paramount to mobilize resources for definitive treatment, such as needle decompression or chest tube replacement."

        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must recognize the classic signs of a tension pneumothorax and anticipate the necessary life-saving intervention. Preparing the equipment for needle decompression (thoracostomy) while awaiting the RRT/provider demonstrates appropriate clinical foresight and saves critical seconds in treating this time-sensitive emergency."

        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While placing a client in a high-Fowler's position can help with breathing in many respiratory conditions, it is not a priority action in this scenario and will not resolve the underlying mechanical obstruction of a tension pneumothorax. The client's profound hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) may worsen with an upright position due to decreased venous return. The focus must be on immediate life-saving interventions like checking the tube and calling for help."
