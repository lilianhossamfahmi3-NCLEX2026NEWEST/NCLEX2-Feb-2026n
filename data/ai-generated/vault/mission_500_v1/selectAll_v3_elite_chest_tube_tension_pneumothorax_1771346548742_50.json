      "content": "A 68-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and occupational silicosis was admitted for failure to thrive. A right subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) was placed at 1300 (1:00 PM) for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Post-procedure chest x-ray revealed a right-sided pneumothorax. A 28-French chest tube was inserted in the emergency department at 1345 (1:45 PM) and connected to a water seal drainage system with suction at -20 cm H2O. The client reported immediate relief of dyspnea.\n\n**1430 (2:30 PM):** Called to the client's room for acute respiratory distress. Client is extremely anxious, diaphoretic, and grabbing at their chest. States, \"I can't breathe.\" Notable tracheal deviation to the left side. Right side of chest has no audible breath sounds. Distended neck veins are present. The chest tube drainage system shows no tidaling in the water seal chamber and no air leak bubbling. Dressings are dry and intact."

There is no significant mediastinal shift noted at this time. The tip of the newly placed right subclavian catheter terminates appropriately at the cavoatrial junction.

The client's acute respiratory distress, absent breath sounds on the right, tracheal deviation to the left, distended neck veins, and absent tidaling in the chest tube water seal chamber are classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. The absence of tidaling suggests an obstruction preventing air from escaping the pleural space. The nurse should immediately assess the chest tube system for kinks, clamps, or other obstructions. This is a rapid, independent intervention that can quickly improve the client's condition.",

      "pathophysiology": "A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrapleural pressure. This pressure compresses the lung, mediastinum, and great vessels, impairing venous return to the heart and causing decreased cardiac output and hypotension. The lack of tidaling indicates that the pressure gradient between the pleural space and the drainage system is not being relieved, suggesting an obstruction."
