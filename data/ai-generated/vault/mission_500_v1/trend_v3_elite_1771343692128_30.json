The constellation of findings includes: significant bradycardia (HR 52), hypotension (BP 92/58), new neurological symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, xanthopsia - 'yellow halos'), and gastrointestinal upset (nausea). These are classic signs of toxicity. The laboratory data confirm risk factors that potentiate toxicity: worsening acute kidney injury (Creatinine rising from 1.5 to 2.2), which impairs digoxin clearance, and hypokalemia (K+ 3.2), which increases myocardial sensitivity to digoxin. The ECG findings (scooped STs, PVCs) further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the absolute first priority is to prevent further harm by withholding the next dose of digoxin. The second priority is to immediately communicate these critical findings to the provider for further orders, which may include a STAT digoxin level and antidote (Digibind).",
