The nurse's highest priority is to recognize and act on immediate life threats. First, initiating an insulin infusion in a client with a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L is a critical safety error. Insulin drives potassium into the cells, which would cause life-threatening hypokalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest. The insulin must be withheld. Second, the client's oxygen saturation has dropped to 87% despite supplemental oxygen, indicating worsening respiratory status and severe hypoxia, a life-threatening condition requiring immediate escalation of oxygen therapy. Third, the combination of a known history of heart failure, new bibasilar crackles, and a significantly elevated troponin level indicates underlying cardiac dysfunction and acute myocardial injury. The ordered aggressive fluid resuscitation rate of 1 L/hr poses a high risk of precipitating acute cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema. This requires immediate clarification with the provider.",

Safe practice dictates that potassium levels must be corrected to at least 3.3 mEq/L before initiating insulin therapy."

While HHS requires aggressive fluid replacement, this client has a history of heart failure, bibasilar crackles, and a new, significantly elevated troponin, indicating acute myocardial injury.
