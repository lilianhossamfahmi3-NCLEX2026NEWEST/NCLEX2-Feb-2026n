The priority is to recognize this life-threatening emergency and mobilize a multidisciplinary team. First, the nurse must immediately notify the RRT and provider to bring critical care expertise to the bedside. Concurrently, the nurse must activate the MTP to ensure life-saving blood products are available. While awaiting the team, the nurse performs immediate resuscitation measures (positioning, oxygen). A crucial safety action is to withhold oxytocin, as it is contraindicated and would worsen the uterine hypertonicity and bleeding. Finally, with stabilization efforts underway, the team will prepare for the definitive treatment: an emergency cesarean delivery.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these actions can delay life-saving treatment or actively cause harm. Initiating oxytocin (the 'DON'T PROCEED' medication) would be catastrophic, increasing uterine pressure on an already compromised placenta and worsening hemorrhage. Delaying notification of the RRT or activation of MTP would waste critical time in treating shock and coagulopathy, leading to irreversible maternal and fetal organ damage or death. While preparing for a C-section is the ultimate goal, it cannot be the first priority before initiating maternal hemodynamic stabilization.",

The client already has a hypertonic ('board-like') uterus. Oxytocin would increase intrauterine pressure, potentially extending the placental separation, worsening the hemorrhage, and further compromising fetal oxygenation. The nurse must recognize this contraindication and withhold the medication to prevent iatrogenic harm."
