The serum potassium has critically increased from 5.3 mEq/L to 6.8 mEq/L, indicating severe hyperkalemia and a worsening condition. **Pathophysiology:** Hyperkalemia disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cells, particularly in the heart. This can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The initial elevated potassium may be due to rhabdomyolysis from the fall, releasing intracellular potassium into the bloodstream. The worsening hyperkalemia suggests ongoing muscle damage and/or impaired renal excretion. **Clinical Pearl:** Always correlate lab values with clinical presentation and ECG findings. Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic until it becomes severe, highlighting the importance of monitoring high-risk patients."

The BUN and creatinine levels have both significantly increased, indicating progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) and worsening renal function. **Pathophysiology:** The elevated BUN and creatinine indicate that the kidneys are not effectively filtering waste products from the blood. This AKI is likely multifactorial, resulting from hypovolemia (due to dehydration from being on the floor), rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown releasing myoglobin, which is toxic to the kidneys), and potentially pre-existing kidney disease. **Clinical Pearl:** A rising BUN/Creatinine ratio can indicate dehydration or pre-renal AKI. Monitor urine output closely in patients at risk for AKI."

This is a sign of severe cardiotoxicity from hyperkalemia and represents a significant worsening. **Pathophysiology:** Hyperkalemia slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart, leading to a prolonged QRS interval. This increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. **Clinical Pearl:** A widened QRS complex in the setting of hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize the cardiac membrane and lower potassium levels."

          "rationale": "Correct. The client was initially described as having 'scant' urine. The most recent note indicates only 80 mL in 4 hours (20 mL/hr), which is oliguria and signifies worsening AKI. **Pathophysiology:** Oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr) indicates that the kidneys are not adequately filtering and excreting fluids. This can be due to decreased renal perfusion (pre-renal AKI), intrinsic kidney damage (intra-renal AKI), or obstruction (post-renal AKI). In this case, the oliguria is likely related to hypovolemia and rhabdomyolysis-induced kidney damage. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor urine output hourly in patients at risk for AKI. A sudden decrease in urine output can be an early sign of kidney dysfunction."

Administering it to a client with severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and AKI would be life-threatening. **Pathophysiology:** ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion by the kidneys. By inhibiting aldosterone, lisinopril can exacerbate hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function. **Clinical Pearl:** Always review a patient's medication list and lab values before administering medications, especially in patients with AKI or electrolyte imbalances.",

The immediate threat is cardiac arrhythmia due to membrane instability, which must be addressed first. **Pathophysiology:** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the gut, promoting potassium excretion in the feces. This process is relatively slow and is not effective for rapidly lowering potassium levels in a life-threatening situation. **Clinical Pearl:** Kayexalate can cause constipation and should be used with caution in patients with bowel obstruction.

The nurse must first take steps to stabilize the client's cardiac status and prevent harm from scheduled medications. **Pathophysiology:** Hemodialysis is the most effective method for rapidly removing potassium from the body. It is indicated in severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes or when other treatments have failed. However, it requires specialized equipment and personnel and is not immediately available in all settings. **Clinical Pearl:** Hemodialysis is typically reserved for severe hyperkalemia that is unresponsive to medical management.",

However, withholding lisinopril and treating the life-threatening cardiotoxicity from hyperkalemia are the highest priorities. **Pathophysiology:** Metformin is a biguanide that can cause lactic acidosis, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Lactic acidosis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a buildup of lactic acid in the blood. **Clinical Pearl:** Metformin is contraindicated in patients with AKI or severe renal impairment.",

This indicates cardiac membrane instability, placing the client at high risk for fatal dysrhythmias. Calcium gluconate is the first-line emergent treatment to stabilize the myocardium. The nurse has an order and should administer it immediately. **Pathophysiology:** Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart. It increases the threshold potential of cardiac cells, making them less excitable and less prone to arrhythmias. **Clinical Pearl:** Calcium gluconate provides temporary protection against the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia. It is essential to address the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia to prevent recurrence.",

Furthermore, given the development of peripheral edema and oliguria, the client is at risk for fluid overload. The priority is addressing the life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. **Pathophysiology:** IV fluids help to maintain renal perfusion and promote the excretion of myoglobin and other toxins that can damage the kidneys. However, excessive fluid administration can lead to fluid overload, especially in patients with AKI. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor fluid balance closely in patients with AKI.
