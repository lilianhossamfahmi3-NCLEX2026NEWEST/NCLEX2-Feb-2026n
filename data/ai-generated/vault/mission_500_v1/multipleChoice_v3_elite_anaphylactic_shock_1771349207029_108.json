Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, will worsen hypotension and can block the life-saving effects of epinephrine on beta-adrenergic receptors, which is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' medication."

      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "While the client is tachycardic and has a mildly elevated troponin (suggesting demand ischemia from shock), the root cause is anaphylaxis, not a primary cardiac event. Obtaining an ECG is a secondary action that must not delay immediate life-saving interventions. The priority is to treat the shock."

    "C": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "This is the absolute first priority. The client is exhibiting classic signs of a severe infusion reaction/anaphylaxis (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, urticaria, angioedema). Stopping the causative agent is the most critical and immediate step to prevent further administration of the antigen and worsening of the life-threatening reaction."

    "D": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "While diphenhydramine is used to treat anaphylaxis, it is a second-line medication that primarily addresses histamine-mediated symptoms like itching and hives. It does not treat the life-threatening airway compromise or hypotension. The priority is to first stop the trigger, then administer epinephrine, and then consider adjunctive therapies like antihistamines."

      "rationale": "Administering metoprolol is contraindicated. The client is exhibiting signs of anaphylactic shock, including hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (135 bpm). Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, will further decrease blood pressure and can inhibit the effects of epinephrine, the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine's beta-adrenergic effects are crucial for bronchodilation and increasing cardiac output. Blocking these effects can be life-threatening.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "While the client's elevated troponin (0.08 ng/mL) suggests possible myocardial ischemia secondary to hypotension and tachycardia, and an ECG might be warranted *after* initial stabilization, it is not the immediate priority. The primary problem is anaphylaxis, causing the cardiovascular compromise. Addressing the anaphylaxis will improve oxygen delivery to the myocardium. Delaying treatment for anaphylaxis to obtain an ECG could lead to further deterioration and cardiac arrest.",
      "clinicalPearls": "In anaphylaxis, prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Address the underlying cause of shock before investigating secondary concerns like possible cardiac ischemia."

    "C": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "The client is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The signs and symptoms (urticaria, angioedema/lump in throat, hoarseness, flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia) indicate a Type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies. The pathophysiology involves rapid mast cell and basophil degranulation, releasing histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators that cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production. Stopping the infliximab infusion immediately prevents further exposure to the antigen and halts the progression of the reaction. This is the most critical initial intervention.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Anaphylaxis requires immediate recognition and intervention. The first step is always to remove the offending agent to prevent further antigen exposure. Remember ABCs: Airway, Breathing, Circulation."

    "D": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that blocks histamine (H1) receptors. While it can help alleviate some symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as urticaria and itching, it does not address the life-threatening problems of airway compromise and hypotension. Epinephrine is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis because it reverses bronchoconstriction, increases blood pressure, and reduces angioedema. Diphenhydramine is an *adjunct* medication, not a primary treatment.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Antihistamines are useful for managing histamine-mediated symptoms in anaphylaxis but are not a substitute for epinephrine in treating airway compromise and hypotension."
