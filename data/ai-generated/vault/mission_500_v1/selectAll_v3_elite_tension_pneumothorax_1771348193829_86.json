He sustained multiple left-sided rib fractures and a pulmonary contusion, subsequently developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is uninsured and had a 6-hour ED wait time before ICU admission.\n\n**0700 Shift Handoff Report:**\nClient was stable overnight on current ventilator settings. Sedated with a continuous propofol infusion. Urine output has been adequate. No new orders.\n\n**0715 Nurse's Entry:**\nVentilator is alarming 'High Peak Pressure'. Client appears extremely agitated, pulling at restraints. Skin is cool, diaphoretic, and dusky. Upon auscultation, breath sounds are absent on the left side. Trachea appears to be deviated to the right. Jugular venous distention noted."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' action. The client's agitation is a direct result of severe hypoxemia (SpO2 81%, PaO2 55 mmHg) and cerebral hypoperfusion from shock. Administering a sedative would mask neurologic decline, potentially worsen hypotension, and fail to address the life-threatening underlying cause, which is a tension pneumothorax."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. This is a lethal 'DON'T PROCEED' action. The high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), hypotension, tachycardia, absent breath sounds, and tracheal deviation are classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. Increasing PEEP would increase the volume of trapped air in the pleural space, further compressing the heart and great vessels, and would lead to immediate cardiovascular collapse."

This action prevents the ventilator from forcing more air into the pleural space, which is worsening the tension. Manual ventilation with a bag-valve mask allows the nurse to assess lung compliance by feel (it will be very stiff) and ensures the client receives 100% oxygen while awaiting definitive intervention."

In a hemodynamically unstable client with classic clinical signs of a tension pneumothorax (hypotension, unilateral absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation), the diagnosis is made clinically. Waiting for radiographic confirmation would waste precious time and lead to cardiac arrest. Treatment must precede imaging."
