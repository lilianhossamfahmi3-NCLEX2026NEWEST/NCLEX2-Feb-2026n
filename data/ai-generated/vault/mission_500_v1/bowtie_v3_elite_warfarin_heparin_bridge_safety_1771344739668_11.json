The client has a history of a mechanical mitral valve replacement and chronic atrial fibrillation. The client's warfarin was held on admission and a continuous heparin infusion was initiated 48 hours ago to bridge back to therapeutic anticoagulation. The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record (EHR) before administering the scheduled warfarin dose.",

Client denies chest pain, shortness of breath, melena, or hematochezia. Appears pale and is restless in bed. Expressed significant anxiety, stating, 'I just feel like something is wrong, this feels different.' Client lives in a rural community over an hour from the nearest hospital, and verbalized concern about managing his medications upon discharge."
