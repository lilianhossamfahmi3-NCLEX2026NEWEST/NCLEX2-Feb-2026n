The client has a history of a mechanical mitral valve replacement and chronic atrial fibrillation. The client's warfarin was held on admission and a continuous heparin infusion was initiated 48 hours ago to bridge back to therapeutic anticoagulation. The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record (EHR) before administering the scheduled warfarin dose.",

      "rationale": "The client is most likely experiencing a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The key indicators are new onset of lower back pain, pallor, restlessness, increasing heart rate (88 to 106 bpm), decreasing blood pressure (124/76 to 104/62 mmHg), and a significant drop in hemoglobin (10.5 to 9.1 g/dL) and hematocrit (31.5% to 27.3%). The therapeutic aPTT and dropping platelet count further support this diagnosis, raising suspicion for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Retroperitoneal hemorrhage occurs when blood vessels in the retroperitoneal space rupture, leading to blood accumulation. This can be caused by anticoagulation, trauma, or underlying vascular abnormalities. The back pain arises from the expanding hematoma irritating nearby nerves and tissues. The hemodynamic changes reflect hypovolemia due to blood loss. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention.",

The primary indicators point towards a bleeding event rather than a thromboembolic one. A PE is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lungs, obstructing blood flow and causing respiratory distress.",

The focus should be on the acute changes in vital signs and lab values, which indicate an active bleed. Subtherapeutic anticoagulation means the blood is not thin enough to prevent clots, but it doesn't explain the sudden drop in hemoglobin and blood pressure.",
