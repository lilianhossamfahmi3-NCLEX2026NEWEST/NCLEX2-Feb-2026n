Lactated Ringer's solution contains potassium (4 mEq/L) and is contraindicated in this situation. Administering it would worsen the hyperkalemia and could precipitate a fatal arrhythmia. The nurse's priority is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the harmful intervention, and immediately notify the provider to get orders for an alternative fluid (e.g., Normal Saline) and emergent treatment for hyperkalemia."

The nurse must first communicate the critical findings to the provider to obtain the necessary orders for dialysis and immediate medical management (e.g., IV calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose). The most immediate nursing action is to stop the incorrect order."

The patient's diagnosis of ESRD, anuric state, lab value of K+ 6.9 mEq/L, and ECG finding of peaked T-waves all indicate severe, symptomatic hyperkalemia. The standard sepsis resuscitation bundle often includes Lactated Ringer's, but it contains potassium, making it absolutely contraindicated in this patient. The nurse's highest priority is to prevent harm by withholding the ordered Lactated Ringer's and immediately notifying the provider of the critical findings. This allows for a change in fluid orders (to Normal Saline) and initiation of emergent treatment for hyperkalemia, which is the most immediate threat to the patient's life."
