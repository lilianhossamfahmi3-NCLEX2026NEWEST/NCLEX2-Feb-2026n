He was admitted from the emergency department (ED) at 0800 with suspected sepsis originating from a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe. The provider has initiated the sepsis resuscitation bundle. The nurse has just received the initial laboratory results and must decide the next immediate action.",

The patient's ESRD, anuric state, K+ of 6.9 mEq/L, and peaked T-waves indicate severe, symptomatic hyperkalemia. Lactated Ringer's contains potassium and is contraindicated. The nurse's priority is to prevent harm by withholding the ordered Lactated Ringer's and immediately notifying the provider. This allows for a change in fluid orders (to Normal Saline) and initiation of emergent treatment for hyperkalemia, which is the most immediate threat to the patient's life. The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves the disruption of the normal resting membrane potential of cells, particularly cardiac myocytes. The elevated extracellular potassium concentration reduces the concentration gradient, leading to partial depolarization of the cell membrane. This partial depolarization inactivates sodium channels, making the cells less excitable and slowing conduction. In the heart, this can manifest as peaked T-waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately, life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. In ESRD, the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium leads to its accumulation in the body. Sepsis can further exacerbate hyperkalemia due to cellular breakdown and release of intracellular potassium.",
