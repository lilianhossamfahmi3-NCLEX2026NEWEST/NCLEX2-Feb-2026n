Subcutaneous emphysema palpated at insertion site, unchanged from yesterday. Lung sounds diminished at left base, clear on the right. SpO2 96% on 2L NC.\n\nDate/Time: Today @ 11:15\nClient repositioned in bed. During assessment, client is noted to have continuous, vigorous bubbling in the water seal chamber of the chest drainage unit. Client reports feeling 'more winded' today and points to his chest. Respiratory rate is elevated. The subcutaneous emphysema has not extended. The provider has been paged with a routine update and new orders have been entered."

The change from intermittent bubbling (normal with coughing post-op) to continuous, vigorous bubbling indicates a new or worsening air leak from the lung.

Discontinuing suction for a client with a large, active air leak (indicated by continuous bubbling and clinical decline) could rapidly lead to a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. The nurse's priority is to act as a patient advocate and safety barrier by withholding the potentially harmful order and immediately communicating the critical new findings to the surgeon."
