The client's lab results show life-threatening hyperkalemia (6.9 mEq/L) and acute kidney injury (Creatinine 2.8), and the ECG confirms cardiotoxicity (peaked T-waves, wide QRS). The current infusion of Lactated Ringer's contains potassium and is worsening this condition. Therefore, the first action is to stop this harmful infusion. The second action is to administer calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent dysrhythmias. Third, the nurse must communicate these critical findings to the provider to obtain new orders, particularly for a potassium-free fluid like Normal Saline. Fourth, while the hyperkalemia is being addressed, the profound hypotension of septic shock must also be managed by starting the vasopressor. Finally, the antibiotic can be administered to treat the underlying infection once the client is stabilized from immediate cardiac and hemodynamic collapse.",
