    "correct": "The client's rapid deterioration with acute respiratory distress, severe hypotension (82/45), extreme tachycardia (148), hypoxia (SpO2 81%), and the classic finding of tracheal deviation confirms a tension pneumothorax. This is a life-threatening emergency caused by air entering the pleural space and being unable to escape, leading to lung collapse and pressure on the heart and great vessels (mediastinal shift), causing obstructive shock. The increased intrathoracic pressure impairs venous return, decreasing cardiac output and leading to hypotension. The body attempts to compensate with tachycardia. The absolute priority is to facilitate the immediate release of this pressure via needle decompression or chest tube insertion while simultaneously activating the emergency response system (Rapid Response Team). Any delay in decompressing the chest can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting any other action demonstrates a failure to recognize a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate, specific intervention. Administering lorazepam would be a catastrophic error, as it would suppress the client's already failing respiratory drive and lead to respiratory arrest. Increasing oxygen or placing the client in a high-Fowler's position are helpful supportive measures but do not correct the underlying mechanical cause of the shock and will not be sufficient to save the client's life; they must not delay definitive treatment. Obtaining an ECG or reassessing vitals wastes critical time when the diagnosis is clinically evident and confirmed by radiology. This is a 'don't proceed' situation where the nurse must stop, recognize the impending death, and facilitate the life-saving intervention.",
