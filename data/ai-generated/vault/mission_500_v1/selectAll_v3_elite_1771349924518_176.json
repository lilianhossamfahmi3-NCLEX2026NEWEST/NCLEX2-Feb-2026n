The vital signs trend shows progressive tachycardia, tachypnea, and worsening hypoxia (SpO2 87% on 4L NC). Laboratory results confirm severe hypoxemia (PaO2 58) with respiratory alkalosis (from tachypnea), and thrombocytopenia. The chest x-ray confirms ARDS. This is a life-threatening emergency. The nurse's immediate priorities are to stabilize the client by maximizing oxygenation (non-rebreather mask, high-Fowler's), activating emergency response (RRT/provider), and preventing further harm by stopping any non-essential movement (canceling transport). These actions address the critical hypoxia and prevent cardiovascular collapse.",

Proceeding with transport could lead to respiratory arrest. Administering morphine for restlessness caused by cerebral hypoxia will suppress the respiratory drive and worsen hypoxemia.
