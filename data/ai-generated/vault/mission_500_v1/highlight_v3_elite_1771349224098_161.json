The order for Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is absolutely contraindicated. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation. Administering this medication to a client with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000) would critically impair the body's already compromised ability to form clots. This places the client at an extremely high risk for catastrophic hemorrhage, such as a ruptured subcapsular liver hematoma or an intracranial bleed, both of which can be fatal. The nurse must recognize this as a critical safety risk and withhold the medication while immediately contacting the provider for an alternative, safer analgesic.",

Withholding Labetalol would allow severe hypertension to persist, increasing the risk of stroke. Withholding Betamethasone would compromise the fetus's chance of survival by failing to promote lung maturity before an imminent preterm delivery. The nurse's priority is to identify and stop the single action that could directly cause catastrophic harm.",
