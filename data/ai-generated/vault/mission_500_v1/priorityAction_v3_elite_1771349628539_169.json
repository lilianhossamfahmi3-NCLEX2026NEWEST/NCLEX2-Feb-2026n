The nurse from the SNF reported via phone that the client \"seemed a bit off today\" after a minor unwitnessed fall yesterday evening, and is now complaining of a mild, dull headache. The client appears drowsy but is arousable to verbal stimuli. They are oriented to person only, which is a change from their baseline of being oriented to person, place, and time. The client's arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the left forearm has a palpable thrill and audible bruit."

      "correct": "Withholding hemodialysis and immediately notifying the nephrologist is the priority action. The client's head CT reveals a small acute subdural hematoma. Hemodialysis requires systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting in the dialysis circuit. In a client with a subdural hematoma, heparin administration poses a significant risk of exacerbating the bleeding, leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), brain herniation, and potentially death. The client's altered mental status (oriented to person only, drowsiness) and vital sign trends (bradycardia, widening pulse pressure) may indicate early signs of increased ICP, further contraindicating hemodialysis. Rapid removal of solutes during dialysis can also cause dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, leading to cerebral edema and further increasing ICP. Therefore, initiating hemodialysis would be a life-threatening error. The nephrologist needs to be notified immediately to determine the safest course of action, which may include alternative methods of renal replacement therapy that do not require anticoagulation.",
