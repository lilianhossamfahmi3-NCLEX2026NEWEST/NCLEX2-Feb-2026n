The nurse from the SNF reported via phone that the client \"seemed a bit off today\" after a minor unwitnessed fall yesterday evening, and is now complaining of a mild, dull headache. The client appears drowsy but is arousable to verbal stimuli. They are oriented to person only, which is a change from their baseline of being oriented to person, place, and time. The client's arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the left forearm has a palpable thrill and audible bruit."

The Head CT shows an acute subdural hematoma, which is an absolute contraindication to the systemic anticoagulation (heparin) required for hemodialysis. Proceeding with dialysis would likely cause the hematoma to expand, leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), brain herniation, and death. Furthermore, the client's clinical presentation (new-onset confusion, headache, drowsiness) and vital sign trends (widening pulse pressure [178/84 from 168/88], bradycardia [56 from 62]) are classic, albeit subtle, signs of Cushing's triad, indicating rising ICP. Rapid reduction of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during dialysis can cause dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, a state of cerebral edema that would further exacerbate the existing intracranial hypertension. The only safe and correct priority action is to immediately stop the process, withhold the treatment, and urgently communicate these critical findings to the nephrologist.",

The combination of an acute subdural hematoma on CT and signs of increasing ICP makes hemodialysis, with its required heparin and rapid osmotic shifts, a life-threatening procedure. Stopping is the only way to prevent iatrogenic harm."

While these modifications might seem safer, they do not eliminate the two primary risks: 1) systemic heparinization, which will worsen the bleed, and 2) osmotic shifts from BUN removal, which will increase cerebral edema and ICP. Any form of dialysis is contraindicated in this situation."

This action can be performed after the priority is addressed."
