        "correct": "The nurse must withhold the alteplase and immediately notify the provider about the client's acute neurological change. A sudden onset of a severe headache ('thunderclap headache') coupled with a decreasing level of consciousness are hallmark signs of an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The client's hemodynamic instability and the PE itself can precipitate this. Administering a thrombolytic agent like alteplase to a client with an active ICH would be catastrophic, as it would exacerbate the bleeding, leading to increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and death. This finding represents an absolute contraindication that outweighs the potential benefit of thrombolysis for the PE.",
        "incorrect": "The other clickable options, while clinically relevant, are not absolute contraindications in this specific, life-threatening scenario. The elevated creatinine requires monitoring but does not preclude a life-saving dose of alteplase. The elevated aPTT is a therapeutic and expected effect of the concurrent heparin infusion. The order for Alteplase is the planned intervention, not a contraindication itself. The critical thinking required is to find the one piece of data that makes this otherwise indicated medication lethal.",
