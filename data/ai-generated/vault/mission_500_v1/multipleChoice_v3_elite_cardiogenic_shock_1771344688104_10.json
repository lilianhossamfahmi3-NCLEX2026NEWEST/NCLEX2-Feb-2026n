He reported delaying seeking care for over 6 hours due to living in a remote area without immediate transportation. Emergent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left anterior descending artery was performed. Post-procedure, client developed cardiogenic shock, requiring initiation of norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Overnight, client has been restless. Urine output via indwelling catheter has decreased significantly over the last 4 hours, totaling only 50 mL. Skin is cool and mottled on lower extremities. IABP is augmenting appropriately at 1:1."

The data shows a falling MAP (<65 mmHg), rising lactate (4.8 mmol/L), oliguria (50 mL in 4 hours), and sharply increasing BUN (45 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.9 mg/dL). Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, causes vasodilation and can significantly worsen hypotension and renal perfusion. Administering this medication would be unsafe and is absolutely contraindicated in this clinical context. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent harm, which requires withholding the drug and immediately communicating the client's critical status change to the provider."

The aspirin can be addressed after the life-threatening safety issue is managed."

The immediate, independent priority for the nurse is to first analyze the situation and prevent a medication error. Withholding the lisinopril is an autonomous nursing action based on safety assessment that must precede requesting new orders."

Increasing preload with a fluid bolus would likely increase pulmonary congestion, worsen ventricular strain, and further compromise cardiac output.
