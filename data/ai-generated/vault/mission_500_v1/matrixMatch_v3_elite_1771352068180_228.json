The vital sign trend shows progression to shock (tachycardia, hypotension). Laboratory data confirms systemic complications: massive muscle breakdown (CK 28,000), rhabdomyolysis (positive myoglobin, tea-colored urine), AKI (elevated BUN/Creatinine), and life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9) from cell lysis. The nurse's priority is to recognize this limb- and life-threatening emergency, stop any action that would delay treatment or worsen the condition, and initiate immediate life-saving interventions.",
