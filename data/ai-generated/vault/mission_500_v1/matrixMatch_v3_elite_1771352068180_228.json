The '5 Ps' are present: Pain (severe, unrelenting, disproportionate to injury), Paresthesia ('pins and needles'), Pallor (pale/cool skin), Paralysis (inability to move digits), and Pressure (tense, tight cast). The vital sign trend shows progression to shock (tachycardia, hypotension). Laboratory data confirms systemic complications: massive muscle breakdown (CK 28,000 U/L), rhabdomyolysis (positive myoglobin, tea-colored urine), AKI (elevated BUN/Creatinine), and life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9 mEq/L) from cell lysis. The priority is to recognize this limb- and life-threatening emergency, stop actions that delay treatment or worsen the condition, and initiate immediate life-saving interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the emergent nature of the client's condition can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis, limb amputation, renal failure, cardiac arrest, and death. Administering more opioids is a critical error as it masks neurological decline. Elevating the limb or applying a CPM machine worsens ischemia. Delaying notification of the RRT and surgeon will result in catastrophic outcomes.",

Administering opioids will not address the underlying cause of the pain (increased pressure) and will dangerously mask the progression of neurological symptoms (paresthesia, paralysis), which are critical indicators of worsening compartment syndrome. This is a 'Don't Proceed' safety stop. Clinical Pearl: Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome.",

This further compromises blood flow to already ischemic tissues, worsening the injury. The limb should be maintained at the level of the heart (neutral position) to optimize arterial blood flow. Clinical Pearl: Avoid elevation in suspected compartment syndrome; keep the limb at heart level.",

It involves surgically incising the fascia to relieve pressure and restore circulation to the affected compartment.

Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening complication of rhabdomyolysis (release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells). It can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. An ECG is essential to immediately assess for cardiac effects, such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, or QRS widening, which require emergent intervention (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/glucose, kayexalate).

SBAR: Situation: 45-year-old male with right tibia-fibula fracture and cast, now with signs of compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. Background: Admitted 6 hours post-injury, pain 10/10 unrelieved by morphine, tight cast, pale/cool skin, slow cap refill, paresthesia, paralysis, dark urine. Assessment: HR 122, BP 105/60, RR 24, SpO2 95%, K+ 5.9, Creatinine 1.8, BUN 35, CK 28,000, positive myoglobin. Recommendation: Emergent fasciotomy, cardiac monitoring, treatment for hyperkalemia.
