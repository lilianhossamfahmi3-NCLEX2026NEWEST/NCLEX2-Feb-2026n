        "correct": "This client is in advanced cardiogenic shock with multi-organ dysfunction, specifically severe hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI). The nurse's highest priority is to prevent further harm. Administering furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, to a client who is hypotensive (MAP < 65), anuric (15 mL/2hr), and has significant AKI (high BUN/Cr) with hyperkalemia would cause profound volume depletion, worsen hypotension, exacerbate renal failure, and could precipitate cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, the first action is to withhold the medication. The second priority is to perform an independent nursing intervention to address the life-threatening hypotension by titrating the norepinephrine infusion as ordered to improve perfusion. Following these immediate safety actions, the nurse must urgently communicate the critical assessment findings to the healthcare provider. Finally, performing a focused respiratory assessment gathers additional data to report, but is a lower priority than the immediate hemodynamic interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Administering the furosemide is a critical safety error. While the client has pulmonary edema, the profound hypotension and anuric renal failure make diuretic administration dangerous. The drug will not be effective in a poorly perfused kidney and will worsen the shock state. Delaying the withholding of the drug or stabilization of the blood pressure would lead to rapid deterioration.",

The combination of severe hypotension (MAP 63), anuria (15 mL/2hr), and evidence of severe AKI (BUN 52, Cr 2.8, K+ 5.9) is a clear contraindication for administering a loop diuretic. Furosemide would cause further intravascular volume depletion, drop the blood pressure precipitously, and worsen renal perfusion, leading to cardiovascular collapse. Recognizing this contraindication is the nurse's primary responsibility to prevent iatrogenic harm.",
