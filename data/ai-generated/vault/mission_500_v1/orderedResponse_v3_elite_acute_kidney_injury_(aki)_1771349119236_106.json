    "steps": [
      {
        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Placing the client on a continuous cardiac monitor is the highest priority. The client's ECG reveals atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and peaked T-waves, coupled with a critically elevated potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L. This combination indicates a significant risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or asystole. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and intervention should the client's cardiac status deteriorate. The peaked T-waves are a direct result of hyperkalemia affecting the repolarization of the cardiac myocytes.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. Peaked T-waves on an ECG are a classic sign of hyperkalemia. Immediate cardiac monitoring is crucial."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "The second priority is to contact the diagnostic imaging department to withhold the IV contrast. The client has severe acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis, as evidenced by the elevated creatinine (4.9 mg/dL), severely reduced eGFR (<15 mL/min/1.73 m²), and massively elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 45,000 U/L. Administering IV contrast is absolutely contraindicated because it is nephrotoxic and could cause further, potentially irreversible, kidney damage. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) occurs due to vasoconstriction and direct toxic effects on renal tubular cells. The nurse must act independently to prevent this iatrogenic harm.",
        "clinicalPearls": "IV contrast is nephrotoxic and contraindicated in patients with AKI. Nurses have a responsibility to question orders that could harm the patient. Always assess renal function before contrast administration."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "The third priority is to administer regular insulin 10 units and D50W 50mL IV push. This is the most rapid-acting treatment for the life-threatening hyperkalemia. IV regular insulin temporarily shifts potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, lowering the serum potassium level and reducing the immediate risk of cardiac arrest. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, increasing potassium uptake into cells. D50W is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells along with potassium.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Insulin and dextrose are used to temporarily shift potassium into cells, rapidly lowering serum potassium levels in hyperkalemia. Monitor blood glucose levels closely after administration."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "After ensuring immediate safety (monitoring, stopping harm) and initiating life-saving treatment, the nurse's next priority is to contact the provider. The nurse must use SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) to report the critical lab values (K+, Creatinine, CK), ECG findings, explain the rationale for withholding the IV contrast, and advocate for a safer diagnostic plan, such as a non-contrast CT or an alternative imaging modality like MRI. This ensures the provider is fully informed and can adjust the plan of care appropriately.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Effective communication with the provider using SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) is essential for patient safety and optimal care. Advocate for alternative diagnostic tests when contraindications exist."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "The fifth priority is to initiate the 1L bolus of 0.9% Sodium Chloride. This is critical for treating the underlying cause of the AKI (rhabdomyolysis) by flushing myoglobin through the renal tubules. Myoglobin, released from damaged muscle tissue, precipitates in the renal tubules, causing obstruction and further kidney damage. Adequate hydration helps to prevent this. While essential, fluid resuscitation is prioritized after addressing the imminent threat of cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia and preventing further kidney damage from contrast dye.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Fluid resuscitation is crucial in rhabdomyolysis to prevent further kidney damage by flushing myoglobin through the renal tubules. Monitor urine output and kidney function closely."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_6",
        "rationale": "The last priority among these actions is administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) 30g PO. This medication works in the gastrointestinal tract to bind potassium and excrete it from the body. However, its onset of action is slow (several hours to days), making it an appropriate but not an emergency treatment for acute, severe hyperkalemia. Kayexalate exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the large intestine, reducing potassium absorption.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is a slower-acting treatment for hyperkalemia and is not the first-line treatment in emergency situations. Monitor for constipation and sodium retention."
