Per EMS report, client experienced a witnessed collapse at home. Bystander CPR was initiated immediately. First rhythm on EMS arrival was Ventricular Fibrillation, defibrillated x2, with ROSC achieved after 18 minutes of downtime. Client intubated in the field. Upon ICU arrival, initiated targeted temperature management protocol with a goal core temperature of 36°C. Currently sedated with propofol and receiving a norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. Urine output has been minimal since Foley catheter insertion. Client has a history of medication non-adherence due to financial constraints."

Administering potassium to a hyperkalemic patient can induce life-threatening arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and asystole. The nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to dysrhythmias. Further potassium administration exacerbates this effect.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always check potassium levels before administering potassium supplements, especially in patients with CKD or post-cardiac arrest.",

This manifests as characteristic ECG changes.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** ECG changes in hyperkalemia progress with increasing potassium levels.
