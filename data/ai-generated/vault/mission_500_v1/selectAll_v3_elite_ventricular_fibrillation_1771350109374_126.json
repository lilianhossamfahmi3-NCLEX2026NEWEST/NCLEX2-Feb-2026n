Per EMS report, client experienced a witnessed collapse at home. Bystander CPR was initiated immediately. First rhythm on EMS arrival was Ventricular Fibrillation, defibrillated x2, with ROSC achieved after 18 minutes of downtime. Client intubated in the field. Upon ICU arrival, initiated targeted temperature management protocol with a goal core temperature of 36°C. Currently sedated with propofol and receiving a norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. Urine output has been minimal since Foley catheter insertion. Client has a history of medication non-adherence due to financial constraints."
