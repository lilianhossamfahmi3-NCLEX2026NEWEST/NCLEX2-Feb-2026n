        "correct": "The client's presentation is a classic, rapidly evolving case of acute compartment syndrome (ACS), a time-sensitive orthopedic emergency. The key cues are pain out of proportion to the injury, pain unrelieved by opioids, and new-onset paresthesia ('foot feels like it's on fire and falling asleep'). The rising HR, RR, and BP reflect severe distress and pain. The laboratory results confirm a life-threatening complication: rhabdomyolysis (CK > 8,000) leading to acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr) and hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9), which poses an immediate risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. The elevated lactate indicates significant tissue ischemia. The priority nursing actions are to immediately notify the provider for surgical intervention (fasciotomy) and to correctly position the limb at the level of the heart to optimize perfusion without increasing edema. Monitoring must focus on the primary problem (limb perfusion via neurovascular checks) and the most severe systemic complication (renal failure and hyperkalemia via labs).",
        "incorrect": "Administering more morphine is a critical safety error ('DON'T PROCEED'). It would mask the progressive neurovascular decline, create a false sense of security, and delay the urgent surgical intervention needed to save the limb and prevent further systemic collapse. Applying ice is contraindicated as it causes vasoconstriction, worsening the already compromised circulation. Preparing for cast removal is an anticipated provider order, not an independent nursing action to take before notification. Monitoring only pain is insufficient as it is a subjective measure and would not capture the resolution of ischemia or the life-threatening metabolic derangements.",
