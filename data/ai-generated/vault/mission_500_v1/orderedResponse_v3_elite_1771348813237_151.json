The ECG confirms cardiac muscle irritability with tall, peaked T-waves, placing the client at imminent risk for lethal arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole). The nurse's priority actions must follow a sequence that first ensures immediate safety and monitoring, then provides the most rapid-acting intervention to stabilize the heart, followed by communication and further corrective actions. Administering the scheduled lisinopril is contraindicated as it can worsen hyperkalemia by inhibiting aldosterone secretion, which would be a critical safety error.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order of actions fails to prioritize the immediate, life-threatening risk of cardiac arrest. For example, notifying the provider before placing the client on a monitor leaves the client unmonitored during a period of high risk. Withholding the lisinopril is correct, but it is not the first action; it is a 'do not do' action that is prioritized after immediate life-saving interventions. Preparing insulin/dextrose is a corrective action, but it does not stabilize the cardiac membrane as quickly as calcium gluconate.",
