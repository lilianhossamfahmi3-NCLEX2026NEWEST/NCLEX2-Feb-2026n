      "correct": "The most life-threatening finding is the prolonged QTc interval of 510 ms on the ECG, which places the client at immediate risk for a lethal arrhythmia such as Torsades de Pointes. Lithium toxicity is a known cause of QTc prolongation. Lithium interferes with cardiac ion channels, prolonging repolarization. The MAR shows an active PRN order for haloperidol, another medication notorious for prolonging the QTc interval by blocking potassium channels in the heart. Administering the haloperidol could precipitate cardiac arrest. Therefore, the nurse's priority independent 'SAFETY STOP' action is to withhold all medications, especially the haloperidol, and immediately notify the provider of the critical ECG finding to prevent iatrogenic harm and facilitate urgent intervention.",
      "incorrect": "Options A, B, and D represent plausible but incorrect actions because they fail to address the most immediate life threat or represent a dangerous action. Option A is a lethal error. Option B and D are therapeutic interventions that will likely be needed, but the nurse's first independent action is to recognize the contraindication, withhold the harmful medication, and communicate the critical cardiac finding to the provider.",

          "justification": "This is a life-threatening error. The client's QTc interval is already critically prolonged at 510 ms due to lithium toxicity. Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, also prolongs the QTc interval by blocking potassium channels. Administering this medication creates an additive effect, significantly increasing the risk of Torsades de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. This action demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical contraindication. The nurse must understand the synergistic cardiotoxic effects of lithium and haloperidol in the setting of a prolonged QTc."

          "justification": "While the client is clearly dehydrated (tachycardia, hypotension, hypernatremia, elevated BUN/Cr) and fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline is a key treatment for lithium toxicity to enhance renal excretion, it is not the most immediate priority. The impending risk of a fatal arrhythmia from the prolonged QTc interval supersedes the need for fluids. The provider must be made aware of the cardiac instability before other treatments are initiated, as they may need to order continuous cardiac monitoring or specific antiarrhythmics like magnesium sulfate. Addressing the cardiac instability is paramount before focusing solely on fluid resuscitation."

          "justification": "This is the correct 'SAFETY STOP' action. Recognizing the critically prolonged QTc interval as the most immediate life threat is paramount. The nurse correctly identifies that administering other potentially harmful medications (like haloperidol) is contraindicated. The priority is to prevent further harm and escalate the critical cardiac finding to the provider for immediate medical intervention, which may include magnesium sulfate administration (a first-line treatment for Torsades de Pointes), cardiac monitoring, and planning for hemodialysis to remove the lithium. This action demonstrates sound clinical judgment and prioritization of patient safety."

          "justification": "With a lithium level > 2.5 mEq/L accompanied by severe neurological symptoms (disorientation, ataxia) and renal failure (elevated BUN/Cr), the client is a candidate for emergent hemodialysis to remove the toxic lithium. However, preparing for dialysis is a collaborative action that requires a provider's order and coordination with the nephrology team. The nurse's priority *independent* action is to first identify the most critical finding (the ECG change), prevent any immediate iatrogenic harm (withhold unsafe meds), and communicate that finding to the provider who will then order dialysis. Hemodialysis is crucial, but addressing the immediate cardiac risk takes precedence."

Consider the additive effects of multiple QTc-prolonging medications."
