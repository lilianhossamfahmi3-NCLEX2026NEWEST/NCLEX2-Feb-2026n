Diagnosed with bilateral open tibia-fibula fractures. Client is alert and oriented x4, GCS 15. Reports significant pain to lower extremities. Client lives in a rural area and initial transport to trauma center was delayed by over 90 minutes.\n\n**Post-Operative Note (16 hours ago):**\nClient returned from OR after bilateral open reduction and external fixation. Stable, transferred to unit.\n\n**0400 Note (4 hours ago):**\nClient resting comfortably. Pain rated 3/10, controlled with morphine PCA. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. SpO2 97% on room air. All extremities warm with +2 pedal pulses.\n\n**0800 Note (Now):**\nCalled to room by UAP for client restlessness. Client is agitated, confused to time and place, and stating, \"I can't catch my breath.\" Attempting to pull at IV lines. A fine, non-blanching petechial rash is noted across the upper chest and in the axillae."

  "rationale": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), a serious complication following long bone fractures. The classic triad includes respiratory distress (tachypnea, hypoxia), neurological changes (agitation, confusion), and a petechial rash. The rapid onset of these symptoms, coupled with the client's history of bilateral tibia-fibula fractures, necessitates immediate intervention. FES occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, leading to mechanical obstruction and inflammatory responses in the lungs, brain, and other organs. This triggers a cascade of events, including increased capillary permeability, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia. Thrombocytopenia results from platelet aggregation and adhesion to the fat globules. The arterial blood gas results confirm respiratory alkalosis with severe hypoxemia despite oxygen administration. The priority is to improve oxygenation, support respiratory function, and escalate care due to the potential for rapid deterioration.",
  "clinicalPearls": "Early recognition of FES is crucial. Be vigilant for the classic triad in patients with long bone fractures. High-flow oxygen, hemodynamic support, and prompt transfer to the ICU are essential. Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation, which can worsen pulmonary edema. Consider prophylactic corticosteroids in high-risk patients.",
