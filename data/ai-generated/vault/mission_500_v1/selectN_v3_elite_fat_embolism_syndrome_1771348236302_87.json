Diagnosed with bilateral open tibia-fibula fractures. Client is alert and oriented x4, GCS 15. Reports significant pain to lower extremities. Client lives in a rural area and initial transport to trauma center was delayed by over 90 minutes.\n\n**Post-Operative Note (16 hours ago):**\nClient returned from OR after bilateral open reduction and external fixation. Stable, transferred to unit.\n\n**0400 Note (4 hours ago):**\nClient resting comfortably. Pain rated 3/10, controlled with morphine PCA. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. SpO2 97% on room air. All extremities warm with +2 pedal pulses.\n\n**0800 Note (Now):**\nCalled to room by UAP for client restlessness. Client is agitated, confused to time and place, and stating, \"I can't catch my breath.\" Attempting to pull at IV lines. A fine, non-blanching petechial rash is noted across the upper chest and in the axillae."
