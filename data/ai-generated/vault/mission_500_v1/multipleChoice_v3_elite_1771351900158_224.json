    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic kidney disease (CKD), evidenced by elevated BUN (68 mg/dL) and creatinine (3.9 mg/dL), oliguria (15-20 mL/hr), and electrolyte imbalances. The most critical finding is the hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L), which poses an immediate threat to cardiac function. The ECG confirms this, showing peaked T waves, a widened QRS complex, and a prolonged PR interval, all indicative of hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, works by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. By inhibiting aldosterone, lisinopril can exacerbate hyperkalemia, especially in the setting of AKI. Administering lisinopril would further impair potassium excretion and could precipitate a life-threatening arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Therefore, the nurse's priority is to withhold the lisinopril to prevent further potassium retention and immediately notify the provider to initiate treatment for the hyperkalemia. This is a critical 'safety stop' action to prevent iatrogenic harm.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either not the immediate priority, are ineffective in this specific clinical context, or are dependent nursing actions that should follow the primary independent action of preventing harm.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "While furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes potassium excretion, its effectiveness is significantly reduced in the presence of AKI. The client's oliguria indicates that the kidneys are not responding adequately to diuretics. Administering furosemide may not effectively lower the potassium level and could potentially worsen hypovolemia, further compromising renal perfusion. The priority is to address the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia by withholding the lisinopril and notifying the provider for further orders to treat the hyperkalemia."

        "content": "Withhold the scheduled lisinopril and notify the provider immediately.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the correct priority action. The client's hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and associated ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS, prolonged PR interval) indicate severe cardiotoxicity. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, promotes potassium retention and is contraindicated in this situation. Administering it would be a critical safety error. The nurse's primary independent action is to recognize this danger, withhold the medication, and then immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia. This prevents further exacerbation of the hyperkalemia and potential cardiac arrest."

        "content": "Increase the infusion rate of the 0.9% sodium chloride.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "While the client exhibits signs of hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia), which likely contributed to the AKI, and fluid resuscitation is often part of the treatment plan, it is not the immediate priority. Increasing the fluid rate is a dependent action requiring a provider's order, and it will not directly address the life-threatening hyperkalemia and cardiac instability. The most immediate threat to life is cardiac arrest from the high potassium level. Addressing the hyperkalemia takes precedence over fluid resuscitation."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Request a prescription for calcium gluconate IV.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "While requesting calcium gluconate is an appropriate anticipatory action to stabilize the cardiac membrane and protect against the effects of hyperkalemia, it is a dependent nursing function. Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of potassium on the heart. The nurse's *priority* independent action is to first prevent causing further harm by withholding the contraindicated lisinopril. The nurse must first 'stop the line' and ensure no iatrogenic injury occurs before proceeding to request new interventions. This is a crucial step in ensuring patient safety."
