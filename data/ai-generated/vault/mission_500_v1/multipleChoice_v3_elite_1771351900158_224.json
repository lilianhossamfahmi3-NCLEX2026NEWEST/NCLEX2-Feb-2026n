This has resulted in life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L). The ECG confirms cardiotoxicity with peaked T waves and a widened QRS complex, which are precursors to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that blocks aldosterone production, leading to potassium retention. Administering lisinopril in this context would worsen the hyperkalemia and could precipitate a fatal arrhythmia. The nurse's absolute priority is to recognize this contraindication and withhold the medication to prevent iatrogenic harm (a 'safety stop' action). Notifying the provider is the essential next step after ensuring patient safety.",

                "justification": "This is incorrect. While furosemide is a potassium-wasting diuretic, its efficacy depends on adequate renal function and perfusion. Given the client's severe oliguria (15-20 mL/hr), the kidneys are not responding, and the furosemide will likely be ineffective. The immediate, life-threatening risk is the cardiotoxicity from hyperkalemia, which must be addressed by preventing any further increase in potassium. Stopping the lisinopril is the priority safety action."

                "justification": "This is the correct priority action. The client's critical hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and associated ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS) indicate severe cardiotoxicity. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, causes potassium retention and is absolutely contraindicated in this situation. Administering it would be a critical safety error. The nurse's primary independent action is to recognize this danger, withhold the medication, and then immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia."

Although the client shows signs of hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia) which likely contributed to the AKI, and fluid resuscitation is part of the treatment plan, it is not the immediate priority. Increasing the fluid rate is a dependent action requiring a provider's order, and it will not correct the life-threatening hyperkalemia and cardiac instability. The most immediate threat to life is cardiac arrest from the high potassium level."

                "justification": "This is incorrect because it is not the nurse's first priority. While requesting calcium gluconate is an appropriate anticipatory action to stabilize the cardiac membrane, it is a dependent nursing function. The nurse's *priority* independent action is to first prevent causing further harm by withholding the contraindicated lisinopril. The nurse must first 'stop the line' and ensure no iatrogenic injury occurs before proceeding to request new interventions."
