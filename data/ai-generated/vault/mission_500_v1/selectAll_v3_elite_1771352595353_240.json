      "correct": "The nurse must withhold the alteplase and immediately notify the provider due to two absolute contraindications present: a platelet count below 100,000/mm³ and a blood pressure that remains above the guideline of 185/110 mmHg.  Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots.  Administering a thrombolytic agent in the setting of thrombocytopenia and uncontrolled hypertension creates an extremely high risk of life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage, which is the primary adverse event to be prevented. Thrombocytopenia impairs the body's ability to form clots, increasing bleeding risk. Uncontrolled hypertension can cause weakened blood vessels to rupture, especially in the brain.",
      "incorrect": "The other findings are either prerequisites for alteplase administration or are not contraindications. The last known well time is within the therapeutic window, the head CT has ruled out a hemorrhagic stroke, the NIHSS score indicates a stroke of sufficient severity to warrant treatment, and the blood glucose is not at a level that would contraindicate treatment. Acting on these incorrect options would constitute a failure to recognize the true safety threats.",

          "isCorrect": false,
          "justification": "This finding is an indication for, not a contraindication to, alteplase therapy. The standard therapeutic window for IV alteplase is 3 to 4.5 hours from the last known well time. A time of 2.5 hours is well within this window, making the client a potential candidate for treatment. The 'last known well' time is crucial for determining eligibility for thrombolytic therapy.  It represents the time when the patient was last observed to be at their neurological baseline.  Alteplase is most effective when administered as early as possible after stroke onset."

          "justification": "The CT finding of 'no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage' is a critical prerequisite for administering alteplase. The primary purpose of the initial CT is to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, as giving a thrombolytic in that case would be catastrophic. This result confirms an ischemic etiology, thus supporting the decision to proceed with treatment (assuming no other contraindications exist).  A non-contrast CT scan is used to quickly identify the presence of blood in the brain. Hemorrhage must be ruled out before administering alteplase because the drug would worsen bleeding."

          "justification": "This is a 'SAFETY STOP' condition. Current guidelines require blood pressure to be lowered to and maintained at <185/110 mmHg before initiating alteplase to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. The client's current BP of 188/105 mmHg (systolic is over the limit) is an absolute contraindication until it is further controlled. The nurse must withhold the drug and notify the provider to implement further antihypertensive therapy.  Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of bleeding in the brain after alteplase administration.  The goal is to reduce the pressure on weakened blood vessels to prevent rupture.  Antihypertensive medications, such as labetalol or nicardipine, are typically used to lower blood pressure before alteplase is given."

          "justification": "This is a 'SAFETY STOP' condition. The client's platelet count is 75,000/mm³. A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration. Thrombocytopenia significantly impairs clotting and exponentially increases the risk of severe, life-threatening intracranial and systemic bleeding if a thrombolytic is given. This finding requires the nurse to withhold the medication and report immediately. Platelets are essential for blood clot formation.  A low platelet count means the body cannot effectively stop bleeding, increasing the risk of hemorrhage with alteplase. The underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia should be investigated and addressed if possible before considering thrombolytic therapy."

          "justification": "An NIHSS score of 12 indicates a moderate stroke with significant neurological deficits. This score is an indication for treatment with alteplase, as the goal is to reverse or minimize these deficits. Alteplase is generally not given for very minor strokes (e.g., NIHSS < 5) or very severe strokes (e.g., NIHSS > 22-25) in some contexts, but a score of 12 falls squarely in the range where the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (in the absence of contraindications). The NIHSS is a standardized tool used to quantify the neurological deficit caused by a stroke. It helps determine the severity of the stroke and guide treatment decisions."

          "justification": "A blood glucose of 165 mg/dL is elevated (hyperglycemia) but is not a contraindication to alteplase. Severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) can mimic stroke symptoms and must be corrected before treatment. While significant hyperglycemia can be associated with worse outcomes, it is not a reason to withhold alteplase. The glucose level should be monitored and managed, but it does not stop the administration of the thrombolytic.  While hyperglycemia should be addressed, it is not an absolute contraindication to alteplase.  Hypoglycemia, however, needs to be corrected immediately as it can mimic stroke symptoms and confound the diagnosis."
