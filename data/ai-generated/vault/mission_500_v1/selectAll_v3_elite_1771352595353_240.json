The standard therapeutic window for IV alteplase is 3 to 4.5 hours from the last known well time.

This result confirms an ischemic etiology, thus supporting the decision to proceed with treatment."

The client's current BP of 188/105 mmHg (systolic is over the limit) is an absolute contraindication until it is further controlled. The nurse must withhold the drug and notify the provider to implement further antihypertensive therapy."

A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration. Thrombocytopenia significantly impairs clotting and exponentially increases the risk of severe, life-threatening intracranial and systemic bleeding if a thrombolytic is given. This finding requires the nurse to withhold the medication and report immediately."

This score is an indication for treatment with alteplase, as the goal is to reverse or minimize these deficits. Alteplase is generally not given for very minor strokes (e.g., NIHSS < 5) or very severe strokes (e.g., NIHSS > 22-25) in some contexts, but a score of 12 falls squarely in the range where the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (in the absence of contraindications)."

Severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) can mimic stroke symptoms and must be corrected before treatment. While significant hyperglycemia can be associated with worse outcomes, it is not a reason to withhold alteplase. The glucose level should be monitored and managed, but it does not stop the administration of the thrombolytic."
