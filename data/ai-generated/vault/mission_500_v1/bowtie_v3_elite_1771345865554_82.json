Client initially reported significant relief of shortness of breath. \n\nCurrently, client is extremely agitated, reporting a new, sharp pain to the right chest rated 9/10, and stating, \"I can't breathe, something is wrong.\" Client is diaphoretic and appears anxious. Asymmetrical chest wall movement observed, with the right side having minimal rise. Breath sounds are absent over the entire right lung field. Trachea appears to be deviated slightly to the left."

The constellation of acute respiratory distress, absent breath sounds on one side, hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia), and the definitive chest x-ray finding of a mediastinal shift confirms this diagnosis. This condition occurs when air enters the pleural space on inspiration but cannot exit, leading to a progressive build-up of pressure. This pressure collapses the ipsilateral lung and critically, shifts the mediastinum, compressing the heart and great vessels. This compression obstructs venous return, causing a drastic drop in cardiac output, resulting in obstructive shock and death if not treated immediately. The nurse's priority is to recognize this life-threatening situation and initiate emergency actions. This includes activating the RRT/notifying the provider for immediate intervention (needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion) and maximizing oxygenation with a non-rebreather mask while preparing for the procedure. Monitoring focuses on the immediate reversal of the pathophysiology: restoration of blood pressure, return of breath sounds as the lung re-expands, and centering of the trachea as the pressure is relieved.",
        "incorrect": "Administering morphine is a critical safety error ('Don't Proceed'). While the client has severe pain, morphine causes vasodilation and respiratory depression, which would rapidly worsen the existing severe hypotension and respiratory failure, leading to cardiovascular collapse. Placing the client supine could worsen dyspnea; Fowler's or high-Fowler's position is indicated. Monitoring ABGs and urine output is important for overall patient status but these are lagging indicators. The nurse needs to monitor the immediate, real-time effects of decompression, which are best assessed by blood pressure, breath sounds, and tracheal position.",
