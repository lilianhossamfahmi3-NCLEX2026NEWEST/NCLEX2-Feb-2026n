Client is now complaining of a new-onset, throbbing headache, rating it a 7/10. He has become difficult to arouse, though he does respond to his name. Had one episode of vomiting a small amount of clear fluid about 15 minutes ago. His mother states, 'He seems much sleepier and more out of it than before.' Per protocol, the IV fluids are to be changed to D5 0.45% NaCl with 20 mEq KCl now that the glucose is below 300 mg/dL. Vital signs have been updated in the chart."
