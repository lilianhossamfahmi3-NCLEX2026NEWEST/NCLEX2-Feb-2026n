      "autonomic dysreflexia": {
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. The sudden, severe hypertension (BP 198/110 mmHg, then 210/118 mmHg), bradycardia (HR 48 bpm, then 46 bpm), pounding headache, flushing, and diaphoresis above the level of injury are all hallmark indicators. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury, leading to an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a potentially life-threatening condition. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent severe complications such as stroke, seizure, or death. Always consider AD in patients with SCI above T6 presenting with sudden hypertension and associated symptoms."
      },
      "malignant hypertension": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client's blood pressure is severely elevated, resembling malignant hypertension, this diagnosis fails to account for the accompanying bradycardia, flushing, diaphoresis above the injury level, and the client's history of a high-level spinal cord injury. Malignant hypertension typically presents with end-organ damage (e.g., kidney failure, encephalopathy) which is not yet evident in this case. The constellation of symptoms strongly suggests autonomic dysreflexia.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Malignant hypertension is a severe form of hypertension that requires rapid blood pressure reduction to prevent end-organ damage. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as renal artery stenosis or pheochromocytoma."
      },
      "intracranial hemorrhage": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Intracranial hemorrhage is a potential complication of uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia due to the extreme hypertension. However, it is not the primary problem in this scenario. The client's symptoms are indicative of the triggering event (AD) that, if left untreated, could lead to hemorrhage. The priority is to manage the AD to prevent this complication.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Intracranial hemorrhage can present with sudden, severe headache, neurological deficits, and altered level of consciousness. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are essential to minimize brain damage."
      },
      "acute pain crisis": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client reports a severe headache, this is a symptom of the underlying autonomic dysreflexia, not the primary problem. An 'acute pain crisis' is too general and does not explain the dangerous combination of extreme hypertension and bradycardia, nor does it account for the client's spinal cord injury. The focus should be on identifying and treating the root cause of the symptoms.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Always consider the underlying cause of pain, especially in patients with complex medical histories. A thorough assessment is crucial to differentiate between a symptom and the primary problem."
      }
    },
    "2": {
      "raise the head of the bed and assess for a noxious stimulus": {
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. This is the priority intervention. Raising the head of the bed to 90 degrees (high-Fowler's position) promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to immediately lower the blood pressure. Simultaneously or immediately after, the nurse must conduct a rapid assessment to identify and eliminate the noxious stimulus below the level of injury. Common triggers include a full bladder (kinked urinary catheter), bowel impaction, pressure sores, tight clothing, or, in this case, potentially overly tight SCDs. Removing the stimulus is the only way to resolve the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia.",
        "clinicalPearl": "In autonomic dysreflexia, always prioritize non-pharmacological interventions to remove the triggering stimulus. This is often more effective and safer than medication alone."
      },
      "administer the PRN hydralazine 10 mg IV": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. This is a critical safety error and represents a 'DON'T PROCEED' situation. Administering an antihypertensive before searching for and removing the noxious stimulus only masks the symptom. It fails to treat the root cause, and when the medication wears off, the severe hypertension will return if the stimulus is still present. Furthermore, rapid blood pressure reduction with medication can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion. The primary intervention is always non-pharmacological: remove the stimulus.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Avoid reflexively administering medications without addressing the underlying cause of the problem. In autonomic dysreflexia, removing the stimulus is paramount."
      },
      "place the client in a supine position and perform a neurological check": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a supine or flat position is contraindicated and dangerous as it will increase cerebral blood pressure and worsen the hypertension, increasing the risk of a stroke or other neurological complications. While a neurological check is important, it is not the immediate priority. The priority is to lower the blood pressure and identify/remove the stimulus.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Positioning can significantly impact blood pressure. In hypertensive emergencies, avoid placing the patient in a supine position."
      },
      "request a stat head CT to rule out a stroke": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a stroke is a possible outcome of uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia, ordering a diagnostic test is not the immediate, independent nursing action. This would cause a critical delay in implementing the life-saving interventions of sitting the client up and removing the stimulus. The priority is to treat the autonomic dysreflexia to prevent the stroke from occurring. A CT scan may be indicated later if symptoms persist despite treatment.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and the immediate threat to the patient's well-being. Diagnostic tests should not delay essential treatment."
