            "autonomic dysreflexia": "Correct. The client has a spinal cord injury at T6 or above (T4). The clinical presentation of sudden, severe hypertension, bradycardia, pounding headache, flushing, and diaphoresis above the level of injury are classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia, a medical emergency.",
            "malignant hypertension": "Incorrect. While the blood pressure is in the malignant range, this diagnosis does not account for the bradycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, and the client's specific history of a high-level spinal cord injury, which points directly to autonomic dysreflexia.",
            "intracranial hemorrhage": "Incorrect. An intracranial hemorrhage is a potential and devastating complication of untreated autonomic dysreflexia, not the primary process. The signs and symptoms presented are those of the triggering event (AD), which must be managed to prevent this complication.",
            "acute pain crisis": "Incorrect. While the client is reporting a severe headache, this is a symptom of the underlying autonomic dysreflexia. An 'acute pain crisis' is too general and does not encompass the full clinical picture, especially the dangerous combination of extreme hypertension and bradycardia."
        },
        "2": {
            "raise the head of the bed and assess for a noxious stimulus": "Correct. This is the absolute priority. Raising the head of the bed to 90 degrees (high-Fowler's position) utilizes orthostatic hypotension to help lower the blood pressure. Simultaneously or immediately after, the nurse must conduct a rapid assessment to find and eliminate the noxious stimulus below the level of injury (e.g., kinked urinary catheter, bowel impaction, or, in this case, overly tight SCDs), as this is the only way to resolve the underlying cause.",
            "administer the PRN hydralazine 10 mg IV": "Incorrect. This is a critical safety error and represents a 'DON'T PROCEED' situation. Administering an antihypertensive before searching for and removing the noxious stimulus only masks the symptom. It fails to treat the root cause, and when the medication wears off, the severe hypertension will return if the stimulus is still present. The primary intervention is always non-pharmacological: remove the stimulus.",
            "place the client in a supine position and perform a neurological check": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a supine or flat position is contraindicated and dangerous as it will increase cerebral blood pressure and worsen the hypertension, increasing the risk of a stroke.",
            "request a stat head CT to rule out a stroke": "Incorrect. While a stroke is a possible outcome, ordering a diagnostic test is not the immediate, independent nursing action. This would cause a critical delay in implementing the life-saving interventions of sitting the client up and removing the stimulus. The priority is to treat the autonomic dysreflexia to prevent the stroke from occurring."
