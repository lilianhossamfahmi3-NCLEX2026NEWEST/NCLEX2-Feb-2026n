This is a life-threatening emergency caused by trapped air in the pleural space, which compresses the heart and great vessels, leading to obstructive shock and imminent cardiovascular collapse. The absolute priority is to facilitate immediate decompression of the chest. Therefore, the nurse's first action is to activate the RRT and notify the provider to bring immediate, life-saving expertise to the bedside. Concurrently, the nurse should anticipate the required intervention by preparing for needle thoracostomy. Supportive measures like applying high-flow oxygen and establishing IV access are critical but secondary to getting the necessary personnel and equipment for decompression. Withholding morphine is a correct decision to prevent respiratory depression but is the lowest priority among these life-sustaining actions.",
        "incorrect": "Any delay in activating the RRT/notifying the provider to obtain orders and assistance for chest decompression can be fatal. While oxygenation and IV access are important components of resuscitation, they do not resolve the underlying mechanical problem of the tension pneumothorax. Administering the PRN morphine, although the client is agitated, would be a critical safety error ('DON'T PROCEED') as it would further depress the respiratory drive and mask neurological changes in a client who is already in severe shock. The correct sequence prioritizes immediate escalation and preparation for the definitive treatment over supportive care.",
