Breath sounds diminished at the right base. All other findings are within normal limits. Client has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension.\n\n**Current time (1400):**\nCalled to the room for acute distress. Client is agitated, diaphoretic, and grabbing their chest, stating, \"I can't breathe!\" Assessment reveals jugular venous distention (JVD), severe dyspnea, and absent breath sounds over the entire right lung field. Trachea appears to be deviated towards the left side."

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition where air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This compresses the heart and great vessels, causing decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. The mediastinal shift seen on the chest x-ray is a key indicator. The priority is to relieve the pressure. \n\n1.  **Activate the Rapid Response Team (RRT) and notify the provider:** This ensures immediate expert assistance for a critical intervention like needle thoracostomy or chest tube insertion. Time is of the essence in a tension pneumothorax.\n2.  **Prepare equipment for an emergent needle thoracostomy:** This prepares for immediate decompression of the pleural space. A large-bore needle (14-16 gauge) is inserted into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to relieve pressure.\n3.  **Apply a 100% oxygen non-rebreather mask:** This maximizes oxygen delivery to the tissues, addressing the hypoxia caused by lung compression. While crucial, it doesn't resolve the underlying pressure issue.\n4.  **Establish a second large-bore intravenous (IV) access:** This allows for rapid fluid and medication administration to support blood pressure and circulation, which are compromised by the obstructive shock.\n5.  **Withhold the available PRN dose of morphine sulfate:** Opioids can cause respiratory depression, which would exacerbate the client's already compromised respiratory status. Addressing the underlying cause of agitation (hypoxia) is paramount.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the signs of a tension pneumothorax and delaying definitive treatment (needle thoracostomy) can lead to rapid deterioration and death. Oxygen and IV access are important, but they are supportive measures and do not address the underlying cause. Administering morphine would worsen respiratory depression and is contraindicated.",

        "content": "**Correct.** This is the highest priority. The client's presentation indicates a tension pneumothorax, requiring immediate intervention beyond the nurse's scope of practice. RRT activation ensures rapid access to expertise for life-saving procedures. **Pathophysiology:** Tension pneumothorax causes increased intrathoracic pressure, compressing the heart and great vessels, leading to decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. **Clinical Pearl:** Tracheal deviation away from the affected side is a late and ominous sign of tension pneumothorax.",

Preparing for needle thoracostomy allows for immediate decompression once the provider arrives. **Pathophysiology:** Needle thoracostomy converts a tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, relieving pressure on the heart and lungs. **Clinical Pearl:** The second intercostal space, midclavicular line, is the preferred insertion site for needle thoracostomy.",

Applying high-flow oxygen addresses the client's hypoxia. **Pathophysiology:** Lung compression reduces gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia.

A second IV line allows for rapid fluid and medication administration to support blood pressure. **Pathophysiology:** Obstructive shock reduces cardiac output, leading to hypotension.

Morphine can cause respiratory depression, which would worsen the client's condition. **Pathophysiology:** Opioids depress the respiratory center in the brain, reducing respiratory rate and tidal volume. **Clinical Pearl:** Agitation in a hypoxic patient is often due to air hunger, not pain.
