In tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to a progressive increase in pressure.

Administering morphine, a potent respiratory and CNS depressant, to a client with hypotension (88/50 mmHg), tachypnea (RR 38), and hypoxia (SpO2 86%) would be catastrophic. It would worsen respiratory drive, deepen hypotension, and mask further neurological decline, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
