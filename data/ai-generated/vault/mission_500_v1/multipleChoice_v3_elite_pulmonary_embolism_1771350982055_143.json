The client states he 'tripped and hit his head hard' about 24 hours ago and has had worsening sharp right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath since this morning. He lives alone and reports the nearest clinic is over an hour away. Upon assessment, the client is oriented to person and place but is confused about the month. A moderate hematoma is noted on the left forehead. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema is present in the lower extremities."

The nurse has correctly integrated all data points: the confirmed PE diagnosis requiring anticoagulation and the head CT result showing an active brain bleed, which is a contraindication. The nurse's primary responsibility is patient safety. By withholding the medication and immediately notifying the provider, the nurse prevents a potentially fatal medication error and allows for a re-evaluation of the treatment plan."

Given the patient has an active intracranial bleed, administering alteplase is absolutely contraindicated and would be catastrophic. The patient's vital signs, while concerning, do not currently indicate the massive PE with hemodynamic collapse that might warrant consideration of thrombolytics in a patient without contraindications."
