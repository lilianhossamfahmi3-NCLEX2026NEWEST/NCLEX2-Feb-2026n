    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The nurse's immediate priority is to recognize and act upon the most life-threatening condition. The client's serum potassium is critically elevated at 6.8 mEq/L, placing them at imminent risk for fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that would exacerbate this life-threatening hyperkalemia. The nurse must demonstrate safety by recognizing this absolute contraindication, withholding the medication, and immediately notifying the provider. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm and addresses the most immediate threat to life.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent appropriate interventions for adrenal crisis but fail to address the most immediate life-threatening problem, which is severe hyperkalemia and a contraindicated medication order.",

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "While IV hydrocortisone is the cornerstone treatment for adrenal crisis, it will not rapidly correct the severe hyperkalemia. The risk of cardiac arrest from a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L is more immediate than the effects of hypocortisolism. The priority is to prevent further harm from the contraindicated spironolactone."
            },
            {
                "label": "B",

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "Aggressive fluid resuscitation is critical for treating the hypovolemic shock associated with adrenal crisis. However, unilaterally increasing the rate without an order is inappropriate. More importantly, while fluids are essential, they do not correct severe hyperkalemia with the urgency required, and this action ignores the pending medication error that would worsen the critical electrolyte imbalance."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "justification": "This is the correct priority action. Spironolactone blocks aldosterone, causing potassium retention. Administering this potassium-sparing diuretic to a client with a potassium of 6.8 mEq/L is a potentially fatal error. The nurse's primary responsibility is patient safety, which involves identifying and preventing medication errors. Withholding the drug and notifying the provider is the essential 'safety stop' action."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "An ECG is an important assessment tool to evaluate the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS). However, it is an assessment, not an intervention. The nurse already has definitive laboratory data (K+ 6.8) indicating a life-threatening condition and a pending medication order that will worsen it. The priority is to take action to prevent harm (withhold the medication) rather than to perform further assessment."
