  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The nurse's immediate priority is patient safety by addressing the most life-threatening condition: severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L). This level poses an imminent risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is absolutely contraindicated and would exacerbate the hyperkalemia. Withholding the spironolactone and immediately notifying the healthcare provider prevents iatrogenic harm and directly addresses the most immediate threat to life. The elevated potassium is due to aldosterone deficiency in Addison's disease, exacerbated by dehydration and kidney injury.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options address aspects of adrenal crisis but fail to recognize and address the immediate danger of severe hyperkalemia and the contraindicated medication.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Administer the STAT dose of IV hydrocortisone.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "While crucial for adrenal crisis, hydrocortisone will not rapidly correct the life-threatening hyperkalemia. A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L poses a more immediate risk of cardiac arrest than hypocortisolism. The priority is to prevent further harm from the contraindicated spironolactone. Hydrocortisone addresses the underlying hormonal deficiency but not the immediate electrolyte imbalance."
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Increase the rate of the D5NS infusion to 200 mL/hr.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Fluid resuscitation is important for hypovolemic shock in adrenal crisis. However, increasing the rate without an order is inappropriate. More importantly, fluids alone will not correct the severe hyperkalemia with the necessary urgency. This action also ignores the pending medication error that would worsen the critical electrolyte imbalance. The hyperkalemia needs direct intervention."
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Withhold the spironolactone and notify the healthcare provider.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the correct priority action. Spironolactone blocks aldosterone, leading to potassium retention. Administering it to a client with a potassium of 6.8 mEq/L is a potentially fatal error. The nurse's primary responsibility is patient safety, which includes identifying and preventing medication errors. This action is the essential 'safety stop.' In Addison's disease, aldosterone deficiency already contributes to hyperkalemia; spironolactone would worsen this."
      },
      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Request an immediate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "An ECG is important to assess the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS). However, it is an assessment, not an intervention. The nurse already has definitive laboratory data (K+ 6.8) indicating a life-threatening condition and a pending medication order that will worsen it. The priority is to take action to prevent harm (withhold the medication) rather than to perform further assessment. While an ECG is useful, preventing further potassium elevation is paramount."

    "situation": "At 1400, a 45-year-old client with Addison's disease is admitted for profound weakness and vomiting following an influenza infection.",
    "background": "The client reports being unable to keep down hydrocortisone pills and ran out of fludrocortisone due to cost. Vital signs at 1405 show BP 84/50 mmHg and HR 128 bpm. Lab results indicate hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L), and hypoglycemia (55 mg/dL).",
    "assessment": "The client is lethargic, pale, diaphoretic, and complaining of palpitations. The client is at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias due to severe hyperkalemia. A medication order for spironolactone 25mg PO once daily is due now, which is contraindicated.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately withhold the spironolactone due to the client's critical hyperkalemia. Notify the healthcare provider of the potassium level and the contraindicated medication order. Prepare to administer prescribed treatments to lower the potassium level (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose). Continuously monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm."
