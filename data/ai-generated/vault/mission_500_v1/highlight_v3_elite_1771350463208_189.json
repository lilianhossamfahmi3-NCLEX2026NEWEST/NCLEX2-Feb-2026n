Over the past hour, the client has become increasingly lethargic and responds only to painful stimuli. Skin is cool and clammy with mottling noted on bilateral lower extremities. Urinary catheter has drained 20 mL of cloudy urine over the last 2 hours. Client's adult child at the bedside reports the client delayed coming to the hospital for nearly 48 hours, stating they 'didn't have a ride and didn't want to call an ambulance because of the cost'."

This client is in profound cardiogenic shock, characterized by severe hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg), tachycardia, and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (lethargy, cool/mottled skin, oliguria, elevated lactate, and acute kidney injury with rising BUN/Creatinine). Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that reduces preload by promoting diuresis. Administering a diuretic to a patient with this degree of hypotension and intravascular volume depletion would be catastrophic. It would further decrease cardiac output, worsen hypotension, exacerbate the acute kidney injury, and could precipitate cardiovascular collapse. Additionally, the client is already hypokalemic (K+ 3.1 mEq/L), and Furosemide would cause further potassium wasting, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.",
