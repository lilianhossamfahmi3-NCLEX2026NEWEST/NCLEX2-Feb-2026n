Over the past hour, the client has become increasingly lethargic and responds only to painful stimuli. Skin is cool and clammy with mottling noted on bilateral lower extremities. Urinary catheter has drained 20 mL of cloudy urine over the last 2 hours. Client's adult child at the bedside reports the client delayed coming to the hospital for nearly 48 hours, stating they 'didn't have a ride and didn't want to call an ambulance because of the cost'."

    "correct": "The nurse must question and withhold the furosemide order. The client is exhibiting signs of profound cardiogenic shock following an extensive anterior wall STEMI. This is evidenced by hypotension (MAP <65 mmHg), tachycardia, lethargy, cool/clammy skin with mottling, oliguria (20mL in 2 hours), elevated lactate (5.2 mmol/L), elevated BUN (48 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.4 mg/dL), and hypokalemia (K+ 3.1 mEq/L). Cardiogenic shock results from the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes diuresis by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, reducing preload. In cardiogenic shock, preload is often already compromised due to impaired cardiac function. Administering furosemide would further decrease preload, exacerbating hypotension and reducing cardiac output, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse and worsening acute kidney injury. Additionally, furosemide can worsen hypokalemia, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias in a patient already vulnerable due to myocardial infarction.",

        "label": "Norepinephrine infusion, titrate to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.",
        "content": "This is an appropriate and priority intervention. Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In cardiogenic shock, SVR is often decreased due to compensatory mechanisms and inflammatory responses. By increasing SVR, norepinephrine helps to raise mean arterial pressure (MAP) and improve perfusion to vital organs, including the kidneys and brain. Maintaining a MAP > 65 mmHg is crucial for preventing further end-organ damage and supporting cellular metabolism.",

This leads to increased myocardial contractility, stroke volume, and cardiac output. In cardiogenic shock, the heart's ability to pump effectively is compromised. Dobutamine helps to improve cardiac output by enhancing the force of each contraction. It is often used in conjunction with a vasopressor like norepinephrine to optimize both blood pressure and cardiac output.",

Furosemide would further deplete intravascular volume, decrease blood pressure, and exacerbate electrolyte imbalances, leading to further decompensation.
