    "highlightableText": "A 68-year-old male is recovering on the surgical unit on post-operative day 2 following a left total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The client has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 4.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was noted to be stable on an ultrasound 18 months ago. The client lives in a remote rural area with inconsistent primary care access.\n\nNurses' Notes:\n04:00: Client reported a sudden, severe 10/10 \"tearing\" pain in his lower back and abdomen, distinct from his knee pain. Client appears pale, diaphoretic, and is nauseated. On palpation, abdomen is rigid, tender, and a newly noted poorly defined pulsatile mass is felt in the periumbilical area. Left knee surgical incision is clean, dry, and intact.\n\nVital Signs Trend:\n00:00: BP 138/84, HR 78, RR 16, SpO2 97% on room air\n02:00: BP 132/80, HR 82, RR 16, SpO2 96% on room air\n04:15: BP 94/58, HR 122, RR 24, SpO2 91% on room air\n04:30: BP 88/52, HR 128, RR 26, SpO2 90% on room air\n\nLaboratory Results (Stat draw at 04:20):\nHemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (12.1-17.2 g/dL) (Post-op day 1: 11.5 g/dL)\nLactate: 4.2 mmol/L (0.5-2.2 mmol/L)\nCreatinine: 1.6 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL) (Client baseline: 1.1 mg/dL)\nPotassium: 4.1 mEq/L (3.5-5.0 mEq/L)\n\nMedication Administration Record (excerpt):\n- Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous, scheduled daily at 06:00 for DVT prophylaxis.\n- Hydromorphone 0.5 mg IV push, PRN every 3 hours for severe pain.",
