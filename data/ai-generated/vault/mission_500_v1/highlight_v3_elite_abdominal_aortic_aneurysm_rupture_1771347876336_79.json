  "highlightableText": "A 68-year-old male is recovering on the surgical unit on post-operative day 2 following a left total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The client has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 4.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was noted to be stable on an ultrasound 18 months ago. The client lives in a remote rural area with inconsistent primary care access.\n\nNurses' Notes:\n04:00: Client reported a sudden, severe 10/10 \"tearing\" pain in his lower back and abdomen, distinct from his knee pain. Client appears pale, diaphoretic, and is nauseated. On palpation, abdomen is rigid, tender, and a newly noted poorly defined pulsatile mass is felt in the periumbilical area. Left knee surgical incision is clean, dry, and intact.\n\nVital Signs Trend:\n00:00: BP 138/84, HR 78, RR 16, SpO2 97% on room air\n02:00: BP 132/80, HR 82, RR 16, SpO2 96% on room air\n04:15: BP 94/58, HR 122, RR 24, SpO2 91% on room air\n04:30: BP 88/52, HR 128, RR 26, SpO2 90% on room air\n\nLaboratory Results (Stat draw at 04:20):\nHemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (12.1-17.2 g/dL) (Post-op day 1: 11.5 g/dL)\nLactate: 4.2 mmol/L (0.5-2.2 mmol/L)\nCreatinine: 1.6 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL) (Client baseline: 1.1 mg/dL)\nPotassium: 4.1 mEq/L (3.5-5.0 mEq/L)\n\nMedication Administration Record (excerpt):\n- Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous, scheduled daily at 06:00 for DVT prophylaxis.\n- Hydromorphone 0.5 mg IV push, PRN every 3 hours for severe pain.",

    "rationale": "The nurse must recognize the signs and symptoms of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention. The client's presentation indicates hemorrhagic shock due to the rupture. Recognizing these findings is crucial to withhold the scheduled enoxaparin, a critical safety measure.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "This excruciating pain is a hallmark symptom of AAA rupture or dissection. The tearing sensation results from the aortic wall's layers separating, irritating surrounding nerves and tissues. This is distinct from typical post-operative pain and warrants immediate investigation. The sudden onset indicates an acute event."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "A pulsatile mass in the periumbilical area, especially one that is newly discovered, strongly suggests an expanding or ruptured AAA. The pulsation is due to the force of arterial blood flow against the weakened aortic wall. The poorly defined nature indicates blood leaking into the surrounding retroperitoneal space."

        "rationale": "These vital signs are indicative of hypovolemic shock. The hypotension (BP 88/52) reflects significant blood loss. The tachycardia (HR 128) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. The tachypnea (RR 26) and hypoxia (SpO2 90%) indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis."

        "rationale": "The significant drop in hemoglobin from 11.5 g/dL on post-op day 1 to 8.9 g/dL indicates acute blood loss. This confirms internal hemorrhage is occurring and contributing to the client's shock state. The normal range is provided for context."

        "rationale": "An elevated lactate level signifies tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. When oxygen delivery is insufficient, cells produce lactate as a byproduct. A level of 4.2 mmol/L indicates significant metabolic stress and is a marker of shock severity. The normal range is provided for context."

        "rationale": "While the elevated creatinine suggests acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to hypoperfusion, it is a consequence of the shock state rather than a primary indicator of the rupture itself. Hemoglobin and lactate are more direct markers of the immediate life-threatening hemorrhage."
