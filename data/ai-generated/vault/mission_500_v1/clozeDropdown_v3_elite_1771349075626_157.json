    "correct": "The client's presentation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, altered mental status, suppressed TSH, elevated Free T4) indicates thyroid storm, an endocrine emergency. Rising troponin and atrial fibrillation with RVR suggest cardiovascular strain and myocardial injury. The priority is to block systemic effects, new hormone synthesis, and T4 to T3 conversion.\n\n1.  **First Priority (Dropdown 1):** Administer Propranolol IV. The immediate threat is cardiovascular collapse from tachycardia/hypertension causing myocardial ischemia (elevated troponin). Propranolol (beta-blocker) rapidly decreases HR, BP, and cardiac workload.\n\n2.  **Subsequent Actions (Dropdown 2 & 3):** Administer Propylthiouracil (PTU) and Hydrocortisone. PTU blocks new thyroid hormone synthesis. Hydrocortisone prevents adrenal crisis and blocks peripheral T4 to T3 conversion.\n\n3.  **Safety Stop/Question Order (Dropdown 4):** Question Aspirin. Aspirin is contraindicated in thyroid storm because it displaces T4/T3 from binding proteins, increasing free hormone levels and worsening the crisis. Acetaminophen should be used for fever control.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options indicate failure to prioritize cardiovascular collapse or recognize a critical contraindication. Cooling blankets are supportive but don't address the underlying cause as directly as Propranolol. Lugol's solution before PTU could provide more iodine for hormone synthesis, worsening the storm.
