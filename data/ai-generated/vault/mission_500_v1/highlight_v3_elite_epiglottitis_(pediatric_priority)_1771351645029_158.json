    "question": "The nurse in the pediatric emergency department is reviewing the electronic health record for a 4-year-old child. Click to highlight the assessment findings and planned interventions in the nurse's note that are most concerning and require immediate action to prevent a life-threatening complication.",
    "text": "The child is sitting in a tripod position, leaning forward with excessive drooling. The mother reports the child's immunizations are not up-to-date due to recent immigration and transportation barriers. The child has a muffled, 'hot potato' voice and appears extremely anxious. Vital signs show a heart rate of 168/min, respiratory rate of 48/min with audible stridor, and an SpO2 of 88% on a non-rebreather mask. The provider has entered orders for ceftriaxone IV, dexamethasone IV, and an albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized treatment STAT. An order for a lateral neck x-ray at the bedside is pending. The nurse is preparing to administer acetaminophen per rectum for the fever.",

                "description": "Stridor is a high-pitched, inspiratory sound caused by turbulent airflow through a severely narrowed upper airway. It is an ominous sign of critical airway obstruction in epiglottitis and indicates the child is at immediate risk for complete airway closure and respiratory arrest."

                "description": "This finding indicates severe hypoxemia and impending respiratory failure. An oxygen saturation this low despite receiving maximal non-invasive oxygen support signifies that the child's gas exchange is critically impaired due to airway obstruction. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate preparation for a definitive airway (intubation)."

                "description": "This is a contraindicated order and represents a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment. Administering a nebulized treatment to a child with suspected epiglottitis can precipitate complete airway obstruction. The procedure can cause agitation, crying, and laryngospasm. The nurse must recognize this is an error, withhold the medication, and immediately clarify the order with the provider. This action is appropriate for croup or asthma, but life-threatening in epiglottitis."
