    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of a severe placental abruption leading to hemorrhagic shock and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). The correct sequence prioritizes immediate maternal and fetal resuscitation (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), followed by timely communication to prepare for definitive surgical intervention, addressing a critical safety contraindication (the epidural), and then completing preparatory and procedural tasks. This order ensures that life-threatening conditions are managed first, safety is maintained, and the team is mobilized efficiently. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall, leading to maternal hemorrhage and fetal compromise. The resulting blood loss can cause hypovolemic shock, characterized by decreased blood pressure and increased heart rate. DIC is a life-threatening condition where the body's clotting mechanisms are activated throughout the body, leading to depletion of clotting factors and subsequent bleeding. The fetal heart rate pattern indicates fetal hypoxia and distress, necessitating immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Any other sequence would represent a failure to recognize the severity of the client's condition and the associated risks. Delaying oxygen or IV fluids could lead to irreversible maternal or fetal decompensation. Proceeding with preparations for an epidural without questioning the order, given the client's coagulopathy (thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen), would be a catastrophic error, placing the client at high risk for a spinal hematoma and permanent paralysis. Prioritizing consent or blood product preparation over immediate resuscitation and safety checks would dangerously delay life-saving care.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the highest priority. The client's falling SpO2 and the fetal monitor showing late decelerations indicate maternal and fetal hypoxia. Applying high-flow oxygen is a critical first step based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) to maximize oxygen delivery to both mother and fetus. Hypoxia occurs due to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues, leading to cellular dysfunction and potential organ damage. The non-rebreather mask provides the highest concentration of oxygen, aiming to improve maternal and fetal oxygenation rapidly."

        "content": "Ensure two large-bore IVs are patent and initiate rapid fluid resuscitation.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the second priority. The vital signs trend (hypotension, tachycardia) clearly indicates developing hemorrhagic shock. Rapid volume expansion with isotonic crystalloids is essential to support maternal blood pressure and organ perfusion until blood products are available. Hemorrhagic shock results from significant blood loss, leading to decreased circulating volume and inadequate tissue perfusion. Large-bore IVs are necessary to administer fluids quickly and efficiently. Isotonic crystalloids, such as Lactated Ringer's, help restore intravascular volume and maintain blood pressure."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the third priority. After initiating immediate resuscitation, the next step is to mobilize the team for the definitive treatment, which is an emergency delivery. Early notification of the OR team is critical to minimize the time from decision to incision, improving both maternal and fetal outcomes. Placental abruption often necessitates emergency cesarean delivery to prevent further maternal hemorrhage and fetal compromise. Prompt notification allows the OR team to prepare the necessary equipment and personnel, minimizing delays in the surgical procedure."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The laboratory results (platelets <100,000/mm³, fibrinogen <200 mg/dL) indicate DIC, a severe contraindication for neuraxial anesthesia (epidural/spinal) due to the high risk of spinal hematoma. The nurse must advocate for safety by immediately communicating these findings to the anesthesia provider so an alternative plan (likely general anesthesia) can be made. This must be done before the patient goes to the OR. DIC causes widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to consumption of platelets and clotting factors. Neuraxial anesthesia in the presence of thrombocytopenia and low fibrinogen increases the risk of spinal hematoma, which can cause permanent neurological damage. General anesthesia is a safer alternative in this situation."

        "content": "Prepare for administration of blood products.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This action is crucial but follows immediate resuscitation and critical communications. While the type and crossmatch is being performed, the nurse can prepare the necessary equipment (IV pump, blood tubing). The blood products are not yet available, making the preceding actions higher priority. Blood products, such as packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets, are essential to replace lost blood volume and correct coagulopathies associated with DIC. Preparing the necessary equipment ensures that blood products can be administered promptly once they are available."

        "label": "F",
        "content": "Ensure a valid informed consent is signed and on the chart.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the final priority among the given options. While legally necessary, obtaining consent cannot delay life-saving interventions. This can often be done concurrently as the team is being mobilized, but physiological stabilization and critical safety communications must come first in a true emergency. Informed consent is a legal and ethical requirement, but it should not delay essential medical interventions in a life-threatening situation. The focus should be on stabilizing the patient and fetus before obtaining consent, if possible."
