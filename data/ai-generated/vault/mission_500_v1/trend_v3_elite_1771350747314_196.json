The most immediate threat is the severe hyperkalemia (7.1 mEq/L), causing cardiac membrane instability. The ECG shows tall, peaked T waves and a widened QRS complex, indicating a high risk of ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Therefore, the priority is the potential for fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. The nurse must act swiftly to protect the heart and prevent a lethal outcome. Requesting an immediate order for IV calcium gluconate stabilizes the cardiac membrane by increasing the threshold potential, making the heart less excitable and resistant to the effects of hyperkalemia. Concurrently, the nurse must recognize that the order for spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is contraindicated and potentially fatal. Administering it would worsen the hyperkalemia. The nurse must clarify this dangerous order with the provider immediately to ensure patient safety.",
