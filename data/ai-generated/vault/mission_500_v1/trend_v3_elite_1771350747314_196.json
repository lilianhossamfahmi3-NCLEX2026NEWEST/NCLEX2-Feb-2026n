This is evidenced by the ECG showing tall, peaked T waves and a widened QRS complex, indicating a high risk of imminent ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Therefore, the highest priority is the potential for fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. The nurse's first actions must be to protect the heart and prevent a lethal outcome.

Concurrently, the nurse must recognize that the order for spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is a critical and potentially fatal error.
