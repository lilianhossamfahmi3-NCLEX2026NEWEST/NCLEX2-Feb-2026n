      "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must synthesize data to recognize a life-threatening contraindication. The client has severe ADHF (BNP >2500, pulmonary edema on CXR, crackles, JVD) and is developing cardiogenic shock (hypotension 92/60, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, confusion). Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, has negative inotropic effects, decreasing the heart's pumping ability, which is catastrophic in this state. The priority is to prevent harm by withholding the medication and immediately notifying the provider to discuss safer alternatives like amiodarone or electrical cardioversion. In ADHF, the failing heart struggles to meet the body's demands. Diltiazem's negative inotropic effect further reduces cardiac output, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and worsening shock. The failing heart is also sensitive to afterload reduction, which diltiazem can cause, further compromising blood pressure.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's hypotension (BP 92/60) is due to cardiogenic shock (pump failure), not hypovolemia. The client is severely fluid overloaded, evidenced by the physical exam (crackles, JVD, edema), high BNP, and CXR. An IV fluid bolus would dramatically increase preload on an already failing heart, worsen pulmonary edema, and could precipitate acute respiratory failure. In cardiogenic shock, the heart's inability to effectively pump blood leads to a backup of fluid in the pulmonary circulation. Administering a fluid bolus increases the volume of fluid the heart must pump, further exacerbating the pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. While addressing the client's hypoxia (SpO2 90% on 4L) is important and NIPPV may eventually be needed, this is not the most appropriate immediate action. The most critical, time-sensitive action is to prevent the iatrogenic administration of a contraindicated medication that will acutely worsen the underlying hemodynamic instability. Stopping a potentially lethal intervention (giving diltiazem) takes precedence over supportive measures. The administration of diltiazem in this situation poses an immediate threat to the patient's life. By withholding the medication, the nurse prevents further deterioration of the patient's hemodynamic status and allows time for the healthcare provider to implement safer treatment options.",
