Deep, rapid respirations noted with a fruity odor to breath. \n\nICU Note (Now):\nClient just arrived in ICU room. Client is now difficult to arouse, moaning and irritable when stimulated. Complains of a severe headache. Had one episode of projectile vomiting. Parents have been notified and are en route."

        "Administer the 0.9% Sodium Chloride bolus as ordered.": {
            "Indicated": "Incorrect. While fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of DKA management, this client's presentation has changed, indicating a more immediate life-threat.",
            "Contraindicated": "Correct. The client is exhibiting signs of Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension, irregular respirations), which is a late and ominous sign of severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and impending brain herniation. Rapid infusion of large volumes of isotonic fluid can decrease serum osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that shifts fluid into brain cells and acutely worsens cerebral edema. This standard DKA order is now lethal.",
            "Non-Essential": "Incorrect. This action is not merely low priority; it is actively harmful and must be withheld."
        },
        "Initiate the regular insulin infusion as ordered.": {
            "Indicated": "Incorrect. The potassium level is technically safe (>3.3 mEq/L) to start insulin in standard DKA. However, the immediate life-threat is cerebral edema, not hyperglycemia. Initiating insulin would rapidly lower blood glucose, further contributing to the osmotic shift that worsens cerebral edema.",
            "Contraindicated": "Correct. The priority of care has shifted from correcting metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia to immediate neuro-protection. Starting insulin is contraindicated until the provider has been notified and the acute neurological crisis is managed. The risk of worsening cerebral edema outweighs the benefit of lowering glucose at this moment.",
            "Non-Essential": "Incorrect. This action is contraindicated due to the high risk of harm. It must be actively withheld, not just delayed."
        },
        "Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees.": {
            "Indicated": "Correct. This is a crucial, independent nursing intervention to manage increased ICP. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees with the head in a neutral, midline position promotes venous outflow from the brain, thereby lowering intracranial pressure.",
            "Contraindicated": "Incorrect. This is a primary, evidence-based intervention for managing increased ICP and is a priority action.",
            "Non-Essential": "Incorrect. This is an essential and immediate action the nurse must take to protect the client's brain."
        },
        "Request an immediate provider evaluation at the bedside.": {
            "Indicated": "Correct. This is the most critical action. The nurse has identified a life-threatening change in condition (Cushing's triad). The nurse must immediately notify the provider to report these findings and receive new orders for emergent management of cerebral edema, which may include osmotic diuretics (mannitol), hypertonic saline, and potential intubation.",
            "Contraindicated": "Incorrect. Withholding this information from the provider would constitute a failure to rescue.",
            "Non-Essential": "Incorrect. This is the highest priority action, as it is required to change the medical plan of care to address the immediate life-threat."
        },
        "Prepare to administer IV mannitol.": {
            "Indicated": "Incorrect. While mannitol is likely to be ordered, the nurse cannot independently prepare or administer it without a specific order. The priority is to call the provider first.",
            "Contraindicated": "Incorrect. This action is not harmful, just out of sequence and beyond the nurse's current scope of practice without an order.",
            "Non-Essential": "Correct. This is an appropriate anticipatory action, but it is not an immediate priority compared to core safety actions like elevating the head of the bed and notifying the provider. The nurse should first stabilize the patient with independent actions and communicate the emergent situation."
        },
        "Administer the prescribed ondansetron 4 mg IV.": {
            "Indicated": "Correct. The client had an episode of projectile vomiting, which is both a sign of increased ICP and an activity that further increases ICP. Administering the prescribed antiemetic is a valid supportive measure to prevent further spikes in intracranial pressure.",
            "Contraindicated": "Incorrect. There is no contraindication to administering ondansetron in this situation; it is beneficial.",
            "Non-Essential": "Incorrect. While not as critical as calling the provider, preventing further vomiting is an important part of managing ICP and is therefore an indicated action."
