        "correct": "The client's presentation is a classic example of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening complication of positive pressure ventilation, especially in ARDS where high pressures are used. The constellation of acute hypotension (82/45 mmHg), severe tachycardia (145 bpm), dropping SpO2 (84%) despite high FiO2, and a rapid, dramatic increase in Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP from 38 to 55 cm H2O) is highly indicative. The physical exam findings of asymmetrical chest movement, diminished breath sounds on the right, and tracheal deviation to the left confirm this diagnosis clinically. This is obstructive shock. The most appropriate immediate action is to disconnect the client from the ventilator, which is delivering high-pressure breaths that worsen the air leak and tension, and begin manual ventilation with a bag-valve mask at 100% O2. This action removes the source of the positive pressure, allows for some lung re-expansion, provides oxygenation, and serves as a critical bridge until a physician can perform needle decompression and/or chest tube insertion. This is a \"SAFETY STOP\" moment where the nurse must act immediately to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
        "incorrect": "Administering furosemide to a patient in shock with a BP of 82/45 would be catastrophic, causing further circulatory collapse. While a chest x-ray is needed for definitive diagnosis, the client is actively dying; intervention cannot be delayed for diagnostics. Increasing the vasopressor (norepinephrine) treats a symptom (hypotension) without addressing the root cause (obstructed venous return from the tension pneumothorax) and will ultimately be ineffective while delaying life-saving care.",
