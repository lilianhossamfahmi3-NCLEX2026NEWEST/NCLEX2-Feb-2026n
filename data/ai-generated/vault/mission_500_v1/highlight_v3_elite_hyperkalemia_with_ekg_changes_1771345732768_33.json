The critical lab value is the potassium of 7.2 mEq/L, and the critical diagnostic finding is the ECG showing cardiotoxicity. The nurse must then determine the cause. The elevated CK and the history of a crush injury link together to identify rhabdomyolysis as the etiology. The crush injury is the event that initiated the entire pathological cascade. Recognizing this is crucial for safe practice, as it informs the nurse to withhold medications like ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril) that can exacerbate hyperkalemia."
