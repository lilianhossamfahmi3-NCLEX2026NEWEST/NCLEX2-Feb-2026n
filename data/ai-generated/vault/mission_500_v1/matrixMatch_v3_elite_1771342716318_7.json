Client reports a fall from his wheelchair yesterday while reaching for an item on a high shelf. He did not report the fall at the time, stating he 'felt fine' and did not want to be a bother. He lives alone and relies on a home health aide for 4 hours daily. Today, the client used the call light to report a sudden, severe, pounding headache rated 9/10. Client is diaphoretic and has marked flushing of the face, neck, and shoulders. Skin below the level of injury is pale and cool with goosebumps noted."

However, the recent fall and the head CT results reveal a concurrent, and more immediately life-threatening, condition: an acute subdural hematoma with midline shift, indicating significantly increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The nurse's priority actions must address both conditions without worsening either. The correct actions are to raise the head of the bed (treats both AD and high ICP), check for and remove the AD stimulus (bladder distention), and immediately notify neurosurgery for the head bleed. Administering nifedipine is contraindicated because rapidly lowering the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the setting of high ICP will critically reduce cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP), causing cerebral ischemia and herniation. IV fluids are also contraindicated as they would worsen both hypertension and cerebral edema.",

Raising the head of the bed is a primary, non-pharmacological intervention for both autonomic dysreflexia (promotes orthostatic hypotension to lower BP) and increased intracranial pressure (uses gravity to promote venous outflow from the brain). It is a safe and essential first step."

While the PRN order exists for the severe hypertension characteristic of AD, the client has a confirmed subdural hematoma with mass effect (midline shift). Administering a potent vasodilator like nifedipine would rapidly decrease the mean arterial pressure (MAP). In the setting of high intracranial pressure (ICP), this would cause a catastrophic drop in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP), leading to brain ischemia and herniation. The underlying neurosurgical emergency must be addressed first."

Identifying and removing the underlying cause is the definitive treatment for AD. The nurse must rapidly assess for and correct potential triggers like a full bladder or fecal impaction. This is a priority action."

Administering an isotonic fluid bolus is dangerous in a client with severe hypertension (BP 210/118) and increased intracranial pressure. The excess volume would further increase systemic vascular pressure and worsen cerebral edema, increasing ICP and the risk of herniation."
