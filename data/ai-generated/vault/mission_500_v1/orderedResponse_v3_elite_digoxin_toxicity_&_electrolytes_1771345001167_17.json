The digoxin level is elevated (2.8 ng/mL; therapeutic range 0.5-2.0 ng/mL), and the potassium is low (2.6 mEq/L; normal 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administering digoxin would worsen the toxicity, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. This prevents further harm.",
        "rationale_2026": "Withholding digoxin is paramount due to the client's bradycardia (HR 48 bpm), nausea, visual disturbances, elevated digoxin level (2.8 ng/mL), and hypokalemia (2.6 mEq/L). Digoxin toxicity is exacerbated by hypokalemia, increasing myocardial sensitivity to digoxin. Digoxin inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium, enhancing cardiac contractility. However, excessive digoxin can cause arrhythmias. Hypokalemia further inhibits the pump, worsening digoxin's effects and increasing the risk of fatal arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Withholding the drug prevents further accumulation and toxicity."

Digoxin's effect on the AV node can cause bradycardia and heart block. Hypokalemia prolongs repolarization, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. PVCs indicate myocardial instability. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection of life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes, enabling timely interventions such as antiarrhythmics (e.g., lidocaine, magnesium sulfate) or pacing."

Potassium is essential for maintaining normal cardiac cell membrane potential and repolarization. Hypokalemia increases digoxin binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, worsening toxicity. IV potassium should be administered cautiously to avoid hyperkalemia, which can also cause arrhythmias. The infusion rate should not exceed 10 mEq/hr peripherally or 20 mEq/hr centrally, with continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent potassium level checks to ensure safe and effective replacement."

  "clinicalPearl": "Digoxin toxicity is a potentially life-threatening condition, especially in the presence of hypokalemia. Early recognition of signs and symptoms (e.g., bradycardia, nausea, visual disturbances), prompt withholding of the medication, continuous cardiac monitoring, correction of electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia), and immediate communication with the healthcare provider are crucial for patient safety. Digibind (digoxin-specific antibody fragments) is the antidote for severe digoxin toxicity.",
