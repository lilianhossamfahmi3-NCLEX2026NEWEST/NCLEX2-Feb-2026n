Client has a known bee sting allergy but misplaced their prescribed epinephrine auto-injector. Partner, who speaks for the client due to client's respiratory distress and a language barrier, reports immediate onset of hives and difficulty breathing. Client self-administered 50 mg of oral diphenhydramine at home.\n\n**14:45:** On arrival, client is anxious, with widespread urticaria, pruritus, and audible inspiratory stridor. Client is tachypneic and speaking in 2-3 word phrases.\n\n**14:50:** Epinephrine 0.5 mg IM administered to anterolateral thigh. High-flow oxygen applied via non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min. IV access established. 1 L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride initiated.\n\n**15:15:** Stridor has resolved, and work of breathing is decreased. Client reports feeling 'a little better' but is now feeling dizzy and lightheaded. Skin is flushed and warm. Transferred to ICU for continuous monitoring."

    "highlightableText": "The client is experiencing refractory distributive shock from anaphylaxis. The nurse must recognize the constellation of findings pointing to this severe state: persistent hypotension (MAP 60), compensatory tachycardia (HR 140), and evidence of profound tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. The single most direct indicator of this dangerous metabolic state is the **Lactate, Venous value of 4.8 mmol/L**. Other concerning findings include the client's report of dizziness and the rising BUN and Creatinine, which signal end-organ hypoperfusion. The slightly elevated Troponin I suggests myocardial strain. While the client has widespread urticaria and pruritus, these are cutaneous findings and not the primary contraindication. The client's history of high blood pressure is irrelevant in the face of acute shock.",

        "correct": "The venous lactate level of 4.8 mmol/L is the most critical finding that contraindicates the administration of metoprolol. This value indicates significant systemic tissue hypoperfusion and a shift to anaerobic metabolism, which is the hallmark of refractory shock. The client's tachycardia (HR 140) is a vital compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output (CO = HR x SV) in the face of profound vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Administering metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would be catastrophic. It would block beta-1 adrenergic receptors, critically reducing heart rate and contractility, thereby causing cardiac output to plummet. Furthermore, it would antagonize the beta-2 effects of both endogenous and administered epinephrine, potentially worsening bronchoconstriction and preventing further vasodilation of coronary arteries. This would precipitate immediate cardiovascular collapse. Recognizing this value as a 'SAFETY STOP' signal is an essential independent nursing action to prevent a life-threatening medication error.",
