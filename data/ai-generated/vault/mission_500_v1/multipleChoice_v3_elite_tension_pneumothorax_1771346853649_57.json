    "correctAnswerRationale": "The correct action is to activate the rapid response team (RRT) and prepare for immediate needle decompression. The client's assessment findings (1405)—acute respiratory distress, severe tachycardia (148/min), profound hypotension (84/52), hypoxia (SpO2 85%), absent breath sounds on the right, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation to the left—are classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space (between the lung and chest wall) with each inspiration but cannot escape. This one-way valve effect leads to a progressive build-up of pressure, collapsing the affected lung and shifting the mediastinum (heart, great vessels, trachea) to the opposite side. This shift compresses the contralateral lung and obstructs venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. The distended neck veins are a result of impaired venous return. The trachea deviates away from the side of the pneumothorax due to the increased pressure. Without immediate intervention, this condition is rapidly fatal.\n\nImmediate intervention to relieve the pressure is critical. Activating the RRT brings immediate expert help to the bedside while preparing the necessary equipment for the life-saving procedure (needle decompression). Needle decompression involves inserting a large-bore needle (typically 14-gauge) into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to release the trapped air and restore normal intrathoracic pressure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis. Do not delay treatment to obtain a chest x-ray. Time is of the essence.",
    "distractorRationale": {
      "opt_01": "This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action and is incorrect and dangerous. While the client has severe pain, administering morphine, an opioid analgesic, will cause respiratory depression. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Opioids depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, reducing the rate and depth of breathing. This leads to decreased alveolar ventilation and increased carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia), further exacerbating hypoxia.\n\nThis would be catastrophic for a client who is already severely hypoxic (SpO2 85%), tachypneic (RR 38), and hemodynamically unstable. This action would worsen the client's respiratory status and could lead to respiratory arrest.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess respiratory status *before* administering opioids. In cases of respiratory distress, address the underlying cause of the distress *before* administering pain medication.\n\n",
      "opt_02": "This action is incorrect because it delays a life-saving intervention. A tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, not a radiological one. The client is actively decompensating due to obstructive shock.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** The mediastinal shift caused by the tension pneumothorax compresses the heart and great vessels, impeding venous return and reducing cardiac output. This leads to hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion, resulting in shock.\n\nWhile a chest x-ray would confirm the diagnosis, waiting for the radiology technician and the image to be processed wastes critical time during which the client could experience cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must act on the overwhelming clinical evidence immediately.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In emergency situations, prioritize interventions based on clinical assessment. Do not delay treatment for diagnostic confirmation if the clinical picture is clear.\n\n",
      "opt_03": "This is the correct answer. The nurse has identified a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention beyond their independent scope of practice. Activating the RRT and anticipating the need for needle decompression is the highest priority to save the client's life.",
      "opt_04": "This action is incorrect because it is insufficient and does not address the root cause of the client's hypoxia. The problem is not a lack of supplemental oxygen; it is a mechanical failure of ventilation and circulation due to the trapped air (tension).\n\n**Pathophysiology:** In a tension pneumothorax, the collapsed lung cannot participate in gas exchange. Increasing the oxygen flow rate will not improve oxygenation because the alveoli are compressed and unable to function.\n\nWhile supplemental oxygen is a component of care, it is not the priority action. Without relieving the pressure in the chest, the client will continue to decline regardless of the oxygen flow rate.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In cases of tension pneumothorax, supplemental oxygen alone is not sufficient. The underlying mechanical problem must be addressed to restore effective ventilation and circulation."
