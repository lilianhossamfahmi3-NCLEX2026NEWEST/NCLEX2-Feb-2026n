        "correctAnswerRationale": "The correct action is to activate the rapid response team (RRT) and prepare for immediate needle decompression. The client's assessment findings—acute respiratory distress, severe tachycardia (148/min), profound hypotension (84/52), hypoxia (SpO2 85%), absent breath sounds on the right, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation to the left—are classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. This is a life-threatening emergency caused by air trapping in the pleural space, which collapses the lung and shifts the mediastinum, compressing the heart and great vessels, leading to obstructive shock. Immediate intervention to relieve the pressure is critical. Activating the RRT brings immediate expert help to the bedside while preparing the necessary equipment for the life-saving procedure.",
        "distractorRationale": {
            "opt_01": "This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action and is incorrect and dangerous. While the client has severe pain, administering morphine, an opioid analgesic, will cause respiratory depression. This would be catastrophic for a client who is already severely hypoxic (SpO2 85%), tachypneic (RR 38), and hemodynamically unstable. This action would worsen the client's respiratory status and could lead to respiratory arrest.",
            "opt_02": "This action is incorrect because it delays a life-saving intervention. A tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, not a radiological one. The client is actively decompensating due to obstructive shock. While a chest x-ray would confirm the diagnosis, waiting for the radiology technician and the image to be processed wastes critical time during which the client could experience cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must act on the overwhelming clinical evidence immediately.",
            "opt_03": "This is the correct answer. The nurse has identified a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention beyond their independent scope of practice. Activating the RRT and anticipating the need for needle decompression is the highest priority to save the client's life.",
            "opt_04": "This action is incorrect because it is insufficient and does not address the root cause of the client's hypoxia. The problem is not a lack of supplemental oxygen; it is a mechanical failure of ventilation and circulation due to the trapped air (tension). While supplemental oxygen is a component of care, it is not the priority action. Without relieving the pressure in the chest, the client will continue to decline regardless of the oxygen flow rate."
