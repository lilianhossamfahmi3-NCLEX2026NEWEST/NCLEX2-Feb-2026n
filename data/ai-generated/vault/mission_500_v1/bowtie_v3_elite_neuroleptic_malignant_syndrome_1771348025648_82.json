Appears to be mumbling, but speech is incomprehensible. Lead-pipe rigidity noted in all four extremities. Sister reports the client was started on olanzapine 2 weeks ago after his first psychotic episode. States he had vomiting and diarrhea 2 days ago and has had poor oral intake since. Sister notes she has been struggling to manage his care at her home as his placement in a supported living facility is not yet available."
