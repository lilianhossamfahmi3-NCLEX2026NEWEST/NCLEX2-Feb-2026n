Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator, works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots.  Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) indicates a reduced ability to form clots, increasing the risk of hemorrhage.  The client's platelet count of 35,000/mm³ indicates severe thrombocytopenia, significantly increasing the risk of life-threatening bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, if a thrombolytic is given. The petechiae noted on physical exam are a clinical sign of this underlying condition. This finding is the single most critical reason to withhold the medication and notify the provider immediately. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always meticulously review lab values, especially coagulation studies and platelet counts, before administering thrombolytics.  A low platelet count can lead to devastating bleeding complications.",

The previous reading was higher, and the administered labetalol has successfully started to lower the BP toward the target range.  Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion after tPA administration.  However, the current BP is within acceptable limits after intervention. This finding requires continued monitoring and titration of antihypertensives but is not the reason to stop the procedure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Maintain strict blood pressure control before, during, and after tPA administration.  Use antihypertensives like labetalol or nicardipine to achieve target BP.",

It is not a contraindication for tPA therapy. In fact, it reinforces the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke that may benefit from thrombolysis.  Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation in the heart, which can then travel to the brain and cause a stroke.  While anticoagulation is often used long-term to manage atrial fibrillation, it doesn't preclude the use of tPA in the acute setting.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Promptly identify and treat underlying causes of stroke, such as atrial fibrillation, to prevent future events.",

The lab result (platelet count of 35,000/mm³) is the primary data point that establishes the absolute contraindication for tPA, while the petechiae are a supporting clinical cue. Petechiae are small, pinpoint-sized red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding from small blood vessels.

    "overall": "The critical action in this scenario is to recognize absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy to prevent life-threatening harm. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ drastically increases the risk of severe hemorrhage. The nurse must integrate the clinical finding of petechiae with the laboratory results to identify this safety risk, withhold the alteplase, and immediately notify the provider.\n\n**SBAR Communication (using military time):**\n\n**Situation (1455):**  This is [Your Name], RN, in the ED. I have a 68-year-old male patient, Mr. [Patient Name], who presented with right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia approximately 2 hours ago and is being evaluated for alteplase.\n\n**Background:**  Mr. [Patient Name] has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation.  Initial NIHSS score was 18.  Non-contrast head CT showed no hemorrhage, but early signs of a left MCA infarct.  He received labetalol for elevated BP.\n\n**Assessment:**  Alteplase is currently pending (ordered at 1455).  However, his platelet count is critically low at 35,000/mm³, and he has scattered petechiae. This is an absolute contraindication to alteplase.\n\n**Recommendation:**  I recommend we withhold the alteplase immediately due to the severe thrombocytopenia and discuss alternative treatment options.  I am concerned about the high risk of intracranial hemorrhage if we proceed with thrombolysis."
