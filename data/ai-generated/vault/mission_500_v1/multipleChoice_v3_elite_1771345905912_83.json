The client was intubated for airway protection. Four hours into fluid resuscitation, the client's urine output has been low. The current plan based on the Parkland formula requires increasing the infusion rate to meet the resuscitation goal. The nurse reviews the most recent data in the electronic health record.

The combination of hypotension, tachycardia, markedly elevated CVP (15 mmHg), JVD, new crackles, and worsening hypoxia despite 100% FiO2 indicates severe pump failure. This is confirmed by the ECG showing an acute anterior wall ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and the highly elevated Troponin I. Continuing or increasing fluid administration (the standard burn resuscitation protocol) is now contraindicated and would be lethal, as it would worsen the cardiogenic pulmonary edema and lead to cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's priority independent action is to recognize this life-threatening change, stop the harmful intervention (the IV fluids), and urgently communicate the critical findings to the provider.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent failures to synthesize the data and recognize the shift in the patient's pathophysiology from hypovolemia to cardiogenic shock.

While indicated for pure hypovolemic burn shock, the client's high CVP, JVD, and crackles are classic signs of fluid volume overload due to a failing heart.
