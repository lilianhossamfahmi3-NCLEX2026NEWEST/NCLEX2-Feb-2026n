The client was intubated for airway protection. Four hours into fluid resuscitation, the client's urine output has been low. The current plan based on the Parkland formula requires increasing the infusion rate to meet the resuscitation goal. The nurse reviews the most recent data in the electronic health record.

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock, likely precipitated by an acute myocardial infarction (MI) due to the physiological stress of the burn injury. The combination of hypotension, tachycardia, elevated CVP (15 mmHg), jugular venous distention (JVD), new-onset crackles, and worsening hypoxia (SpO2 90% on 100% FiO2) indicates severe cardiac dysfunction. The ECG showing ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4 confirms an acute anterior wall ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and the elevated Troponin I level further supports this diagnosis. The initial hypovolemic shock from the burn injury has transitioned to cardiogenic shock. Continuing or increasing fluid administration, as per the standard burn resuscitation protocol, is now contraindicated and could be fatal, exacerbating pulmonary edema and leading to cardiovascular collapse. The priority nursing action is to recognize this critical change in the client's condition, immediately stop the harmful intervention (IV fluids), and promptly notify the provider to initiate appropriate cardiac interventions.",
