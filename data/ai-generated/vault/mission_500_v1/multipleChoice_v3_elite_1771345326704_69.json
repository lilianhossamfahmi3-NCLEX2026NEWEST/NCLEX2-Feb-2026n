    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The synthesis of clinical cues indicates a life-threatening tension pneumothorax, which has progressed to obstructive shock. The key indicators are: sudden hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension), worsening hypoxemia despite oxygen, cessation of tidaling in the chest tube (indicating an occlusion preventing air from escaping), rapidly expanding subcutaneous emphysema, and the definitive radiological finding of a mediastinal shift. This condition causes compression of the heart and great vessels, leading to cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's priority is to immediately stop all non-essential tasks and activate an emergency response for a life-saving intervention (needle decompression or chest tube revision).",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that either fail to recognize the severity of the situation or would cause a critical delay in life-saving treatment. Proceeding with a routine medication, attempting insufficient supportive measures, or spending time troubleshooting equipment when the patient is hemodynamically collapsing are all breaches of safety and place the client at risk for imminent cardiac arrest.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "justification": "This is the correct 'SAFETY STOP' action. The nurse correctly identifies the cluster of cues pointing to a tension pneumothorax causing obstructive shock. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to relieve the pressure in the pleural space. Activating the RRT and preparing for decompression are the highest priority actions to prevent cardiac arrest."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "This is the unsafe 'PROCEED' action. Administering a routine antibiotic is a low priority and is contraindicated when a client is experiencing a life-threatening emergency. The principles of ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) take precedence. Proceeding with this task would delay life-saving care and demonstrate a failure to recognize a critical change in condition."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "While these are appropriate interventions for general respiratory distress, they are insufficient and dangerously delay the definitive treatment for a tension pneumothorax. The underlying problem is mechanical compression of the heart and lungs, not solely a gas exchange issue. These actions will not resolve the obstructive shock and waste critical time."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "Although the cessation of tidaling could suggest an occlusion, the constellation of severe symptoms (hypotension, extreme tachycardia, mediastinal shift) indicates the problem has progressed beyond a simple tube malfunction to a life-threatening tension state. Spending time troubleshooting the tubing while the client is in shock is an unsafe delay. The priority is immediate medical intervention to relieve the tension."
