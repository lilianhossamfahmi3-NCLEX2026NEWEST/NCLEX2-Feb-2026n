            "col3": "Correct. The client's intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is 24 mmHg (normal <12 mmHg), with evidence of end-organ dysfunction (oliguria, rising creatinine, increasing lactate, hemodynamic instability). This is consistent with Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS), which is a life-threatening condition. Prone positioning increases intra-abdominal pressure and would worsen the client's condition, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse."

        "action2": {
            "col1": "Correct. The client's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is trending down and is currently 58 mmHg, which is below the target of >65 mmHg for adequate organ perfusion. Titrating the vasopressor (norepinephrine) according to the protocol is an appropriate immediate action to support hemodynamics while the underlying cause (ACS) is addressed.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. Supporting the client's blood pressure is a critical and immediate priority to prevent further end-organ damage. This action is indicated now.",

            "col2": "Incorrect. This action is not just non-priority; it is harmful and therefore contraindicated.",
            "col3": "Correct. The client is exhibiting signs of shock, but the high CVP (20 mmHg) and high IAP (24 mmHg) indicate that the problem is not hypovolemia. It is distributive and compressive shock from ACS. Administering more fluid would increase third-spacing, worsen visceral edema, further elevate intra-abdominal pressure, and exacerbate the organ dysfunction. This is a classic 'Don't Proceed' situation."

            "col1": "Correct. The data strongly suggests Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS), which is a surgical emergency. The definitive treatment is surgical decompression via laparotomy to relieve the pressure. The nurse must recognize these cues and advocate for the necessary urgent intervention.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. Waiting to contact the surgeon would delay life-saving treatment and is not appropriate. This action is an immediate priority.",
            "col3": "Incorrect. There is no reason this action would be contraindicated. It is essential for client survival."
        },
        "action5": {
            "col1": "Incorrect. While the client has an acute kidney injury (AKI) and may eventually require CRRT, it is not the immediate, priority intervention.",
            "col2": "Correct. The client has an acute kidney injury (oliguria, elevated BUN/Creatinine). While renal replacement therapy may be needed later, the immediate life-threat is cardiovascular collapse from ACS. The priority is to address the ACS via surgical decompression. Preparing for CRRT is not the primary focus at this critical moment.",
            "col3": "Incorrect. Preparing for CRRT is not harmful, just not the current priority. The root cause of the AKI is likely the high intra-abdominal pressure, which must be treated first."
