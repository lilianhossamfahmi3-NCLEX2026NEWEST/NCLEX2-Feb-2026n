Skin is pale and cool to the touch distal to the cast. Reports new onset of \"pins and needles\" in his foot.\n\n**1415:** Passive dorsiflexion of the client's toes elicits an extreme pain response (10/10).

    "correct": "The client's presentation of pain disproportionate to the injury, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness (late sign), and a tense extremity are classic signs of acute compartment syndrome (ACS). In ACS, increased pressure within a confined space (in this case, the muscle compartment of the lower leg) compromises blood flow and nerve function. This is often caused by trauma, leading to swelling and edema within the compartment. The systemic data, including tea-colored urine, extremely high creatine kinase (CK), positive urine myoglobin, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and hyperkalemia, confirm the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury (AKI). Rhabdomyolysis occurs when damaged muscle tissue releases intracellular contents (myoglobin, potassium, CK) into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can cause direct tubular damage in the kidneys, leading to AKI. The elevated BUN and creatinine reflect impaired kidney function. The most immediate life-threatening complication of this condition is hyperkalemia (6.4 mEq/L), which can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Elevated potassium disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to arrhythmias such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and ultimately ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The nurse's priority action is to prevent further harm. Administering ketorolac, a potent NSAID, is strictly contraindicated as it is nephrotoxic and will worsen the ongoing AKI. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces renal blood flow and can exacerbate kidney injury. Therefore, the nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider of the complete clinical picture, anticipating orders for emergency fasciotomy and management of hyperkalemia and AKI. A fasciotomy involves surgically opening the affected compartment to relieve pressure and restore blood flow. Management of hyperkalemia may include medications like calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, and potassium binders.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting any other pathway demonstrates a failure to synthesize the data to identify the full scope of the emergency (ACS + Rhabdomyolysis + AKI), correctly prioritize the most immediate life-threat (hyperkalemia), or recognize a critical contraindication to a scheduled medication (the 'Safety Stop'). Administering ketorolac or elevating the limb would directly cause harm. While a fasciotomy is needed, the nurse's independent priority is to first prevent iatrogenic injury by withholding the harmful medication and escalating care.",
