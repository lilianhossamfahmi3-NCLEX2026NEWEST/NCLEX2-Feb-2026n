He lives alone in a senior housing complex and states, 'It's hard to get fresh food, so I've been eating a lot of canned soup.' On assessment, lungs have crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally. 2+ pitting edema noted in lower extremities. Alert and oriented x3. IV Furosemide 80 mg administered.\n\n1800: Client is now drowsy and slow to respond to questions. Skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Reports feeling dizzy."
