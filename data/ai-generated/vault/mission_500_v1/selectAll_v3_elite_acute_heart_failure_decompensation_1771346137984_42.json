He lives alone in a senior housing complex and states, 'It's hard to get fresh food, so I've been eating a lot of canned soup.' On assessment, lungs have crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally. 2+ pitting edema noted in lower extremities. Alert and oriented x3. IV Furosemide 80 mg administered.\n\n1800: Client is now drowsy and slow to respond to questions. Skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Reports feeling dizzy."

In this client, the 1800 vital signs reveal hypotension (88/58 mmHg) and bradycardia (54 bpm). These findings indicate the client is hemodynamically unstable. Administering carvedilol would further decrease the heart rate and blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers block the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine, leading to decreased cardiac output and contractility.",

Withholding the medication is essential to prevent further hemodynamic compromise. The client is exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock, likely due to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand by slowing the heart rate and decreasing contractility, which is detrimental in this situation.",

These are signs of worsening heart failure and potential cardiogenic shock. Notifying the healthcare provider immediately is crucial for prompt intervention, which may include vasopressors or inotropic support.

Administering a 500 mL bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride would increase the client's preload, exacerbating fluid overload and potentially leading to pulmonary edema.

The client's low blood pressure (88/58 mmHg) suggests inadequate cerebral perfusion. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position could worsen hypotension and lead to syncope.
