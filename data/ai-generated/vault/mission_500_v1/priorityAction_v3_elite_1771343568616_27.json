The client's serum potassium is critically low at 2.4 mEq/L, which is confirmed by classic ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U-waves, ST depression) and the client's new symptom of palpitations. Insulin therapy is a primary driver of potassium into the cells, and continuing the infusion, even at the current rate, will worsen the hypokalemia and put the client at imminent risk for fatal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest). The nurse must exercise independent judgment to stop a prescribed therapy that is now causing harm and immediately escalate care by notifying the provider.",
        "incorrect": "All other options fail to address the immediate, life-threatening iatrogenic complication. Increasing the insulin is directly harmful. Addressing acidosis or hydration is a lower priority than preventing imminent cardiac arrest. Requesting a change without first stopping the cause of the problem is an unsafe delay.
