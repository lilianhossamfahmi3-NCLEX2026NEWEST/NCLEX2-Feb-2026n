The client's severe hyperkalemia (6.9 mEq/L) is causing significant cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by the peaked T-waves and widened QRS on the ECG. This places the client at imminent risk of lethal cardiac arrhythmias. The first priority is immediate safety via cardiac monitoring. The second is to urgently communicate this critical situation to the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment. The third priority is to actively prevent harm by withholding the lisinopril, which would worsen hyperkalemia and hypotension. The fourth priority is to address the prerenal AKI with fluid resuscitation, which is important but secondary to cardiac stabilization. Finally, anticipating orders for medications to lower potassium is the last step in this initial sequence.",

The combination of a potassium level of 6.9 mEq/L and ECG changes (peaked T-waves, wide QRS) indicates severe cardiotoxicity. The client is at extremely high risk for deteriorating into a lethal arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia or asystole. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and intervention, which is paramount for patient survival."

The provider needs to be informed of the life-threatening hyperkalemia and ECG changes to prescribe emergency interventions, such as IV calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, followed by IV insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly."

                    "justification": "This is the THIRD priority and represents a critical 'SAFETY STOP.' Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which can increase serum potassium levels by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. Administering this medication to a client with a potassium of 6.9 mEq/L would be a catastrophic error, potentially pushing them into cardiac arrest. It would also worsen the existing hypotension. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm."

                    "justification": "This is the FOURTH priority. The client's history (gastroenteritis) and labs (high BUN:Cr ratio) suggest a prerenal AKI secondary to dehydration. Fluid resuscitation is the correct treatment for the underlying cause. However, it is a lower priority than stabilizing the life-threatening cardiac effects of hyperkalemia. This action is therapeutic but not as immediately life-saving as the first three steps."

                    "justification": "This is the FIFTH priority. This action involves anticipating a provider's order. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a potassium-binding resin used to remove potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract. While it is an appropriate treatment for hyperkalemia, it requires a new order (which will come after notifying the provider) and has a slower onset of action compared to emergency measures like insulin/dextrose. Therefore, preparing for its administration is a correct but final step in this initial sequence."
