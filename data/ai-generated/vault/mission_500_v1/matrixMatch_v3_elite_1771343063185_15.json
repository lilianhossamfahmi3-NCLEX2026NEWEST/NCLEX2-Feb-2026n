This is a life-threatening complication of barotrauma from high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS. The buildup of air in the pleural space is causing lung collapse and mediastinal shift, leading to obstructive shock. The primary nursing priorities are to recognize this emergency and prepare for immediate, life-saving intervention (needle decompression/chest tube insertion) while supporting circulation (ensuring IV access for resuscitation). All other actions are secondary or directly harmful.",

Administering a diuretic like furosemide to a client in obstructive shock would exacerbate hypotension. Increasing sedation masks the neurological signs of hypoxia and also causes vasodilation, worsening the shock state. Proning is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable clients and would delay life-saving treatment. Increasing PEEP, the likely cause of the pneumothorax, would be catastrophic, increasing the air leak and tension physiology.",
