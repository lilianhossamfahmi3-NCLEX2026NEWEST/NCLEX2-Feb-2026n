    "correct": "The client's acute decompensation (agitation, tachypnea, asymmetrical chest movement, diminished breath sounds on the left, SpO2 84%, HR 135, BP 88/50) strongly suggests a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening complication of ARDS and mechanical ventilation. High PEEP can cause barotrauma, leading to air leakage into the pleural space. This trapped air compresses the lung and mediastinum, causing obstructive shock. Immediate needle decompression and chest tube insertion are crucial to relieve pressure and restore lung function. Establishing IV access is vital for resuscitation. Other actions are secondary or harmful.",
    "incorrect": "Contraindicated actions worsen the client's condition. Furosemide exacerbates hypotension in obstructive shock. Increasing sedation masks hypoxia signs and worsens shock. Proning is unsafe in unstable clients and delays treatment. Increasing PEEP worsens the pneumothorax.",

        "label": "Administer the scheduled 0800 dose of furosemide 40 mg IV.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Contraindicated. The client's BP of 88/50 and elevated lactate of 4.5 mmol/L indicate obstructive shock. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, would further reduce preload by decreasing intravascular volume, worsening hypotension and compromising organ perfusion. In ARDS, maintaining adequate circulating volume is crucial for oxygen delivery."

        "label": "Increase the propofol infusion to manage client agitation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Contraindicated. The client's agitation is likely due to severe hypoxia from the tension pneumothorax, not inadequate sedation. Increasing propofol, a sedative-hypnotic, would mask this critical neurological sign, potentially leading to respiratory depression and further vasodilation, exacerbating hypotension. Addressing the underlying cause (pneumothorax) is paramount."

        "label": "Prepare for immediate needle decompression and chest tube insertion.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Indicated. The clinical presentation (sudden agitation, asymmetrical chest movement, diminished breath sounds, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia) is highly suggestive of a tension pneumothorax. This requires immediate intervention to relieve the pressure in the pleural space, allowing the lung to re-expand and restoring venous return to the heart. Needle decompression is followed by chest tube insertion for continuous drainage."

        "label": "Place the client in a prone position to improve oxygenation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Contraindicated. While proning can improve oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, it is absolutely contraindicated in the setting of acute hemodynamic instability, shock, and suspected tension pneumothorax. Proning is a complex maneuver that would significantly delay the necessary chest decompression and could worsen the client's condition."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Contraindicated. The tension pneumothorax is likely a result of barotrauma from the high PEEP levels used in ARDS management. Increasing PEEP would force more air into the pleural space, worsening the tension pneumothorax, further compromising cardiovascular function, and potentially leading to cardiac arrest. PEEP should be reduced or maintained while addressing the pneumothorax."

        "label": "Ensure a second large-bore IV access is available and patent.",

        "rationale": "Indicated. The client is in obstructive shock and requires aggressive resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors (already on norepinephrine). Securing reliable, large-bore IV access is a critical step in managing shock and preparing for potential rapid deterioration during the chest tube insertion procedure. This allows for rapid administration of fluids and medications."
