The client was admitted 5 days ago for a new, extensive left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan is to discharge the client once bridged from the heparin infusion to a therapeutic warfarin regimen. Based on the data in the client's EHR, which actions by the nurse are indicated at this time? Select all that apply.",

Started on weight-based IV heparin infusion per protocol. Platelet count at admission was 280,000/mm³. Client educated on plan to bridge to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. History of CKD Stage 3, lives in a rural area with limited access to frequent lab monitoring.\n\nDay 5, 1730: During assessment, client noted to have new, fine, non-blanching petechiae scattered across both lower legs and abdomen. Client reports mild, new-onset shortness of breath with exertion when repositioning in bed. Denies chest pain. Left leg remains edematous, consistent with prior assessments."

The platelet count has dropped by more than 50% from baseline (280,000 to 110,000) within the typical 5-10 day window. Administering warfarin to a client with HIT before starting a non-heparin anticoagulant can lead to venous limb gangrene and is strongly contraindicated."

The combination of a >50% drop in platelet count, the timing (day 5 of therapy), new petechiae, and worsening tachycardia/tachypnea are hallmark signs. Continuing heparin exposes the client to a massive risk of thrombosis."

The provider must be notified immediately of the platelet trend, new petechiae, and vital sign changes. This allows for new orders to confirm HIT (e.g., serotonin release assay) and to initiate an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin)."

Given the suspicion for HIT, which creates a hypercoagulable state and high risk for new DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), the client should be placed on strict bed rest as a safety measure to reduce embolic risk until the condition is evaluated and managed."

While the new shortness of breath and tachypnea could suggest a PE (a possible complication of HIT), preparing for a specific diagnostic test is not the nurse's independent priority. The priority actions are to stop the offending agent (heparin), stabilize the client (strict bed rest), and notify the provider. The provider will then determine the necessary diagnostic workup."
