The client's clinical presentation (new petechiae, drop in platelet count >50% from baseline, tachycardia, tachypnea) strongly suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a paradoxical reaction where heparin causes platelet activation and thrombosis. The drop in platelets is due to antibodies that activate platelets in the presence of heparin, leading to platelet consumption and a prothrombotic state. Administering warfarin without initiating a non-heparin anticoagulant can lead to venous limb gangrene due to the initial protein C depletion caused by warfarin.",

      "rationale": "Correct. The priority action is to immediately stop the heparin infusion. The client's presentation is highly suspicious for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a life-threatening immune-mediated reaction to heparin that causes a paradoxical thrombotic state. The pathophysiology involves the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex. These antibodies activate platelets, leading to platelet consumption and thrombosis. Continuing the heparin infusion will exacerbate the condition and increase the risk of thromboembolic complications.",

      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The healthcare provider must be notified immediately of the client's assessment findings and lab results. The significant drop in platelet count, new petechiae, and changes in vital signs warrant immediate investigation for HIT and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE). The provider will likely order a HIT antibody test (e.g., ELISA, serotonin release assay) and initiate an alternative anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin). Prompt communication ensures timely diagnosis and management.",

Protamine sulfate is a heparin reversal agent used in cases of heparin overdose or excessive anticoagulation, indicated by a significantly elevated aPTT and active bleeding. The client's aPTT is within the therapeutic range (60-80 seconds), and the primary concern is HIT, not excessive anticoagulation. Protamine sulfate will not address the underlying immune-mediated thrombotic process in HIT and is therefore not indicated.",

Given the suspicion for HIT, the client is at increased risk for thromboembolic events, including new DVT or PE. Strict bed rest minimizes movement and reduces the risk of dislodging existing thrombi or forming new ones. This provides a temporary measure to reduce embolic risk until the condition is evaluated and managed with alternative anticoagulation.",

The nurse's priority is to stop the heparin infusion, notify the provider, and stabilize the client. The provider will determine the need for diagnostic testing, including a V/Q scan or CT angiography, after evaluating the client's overall condition and risk factors.",
