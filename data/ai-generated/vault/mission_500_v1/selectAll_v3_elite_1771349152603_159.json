Beta-blockers reduce sympathetic stimulation of the heart, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. In this case, the client's heart is already compromised, and further reduction in heart rate and contractility could precipitate cardiovascular collapse. The 3rd-degree AV block prevents atrial impulses from reaching the ventricles, resulting in a slow ventricular escape rhythm. A beta-blocker would further suppress this already slow rhythm.",

ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting angiotensin II, lisinopril reduces systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. In a client already experiencing cardiogenic shock and hypotension, this vasodilation would further compromise blood pressure and tissue perfusion.",

Administering additional potassium is a lethal error that would exacerbate hyperkalemia, increasing the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias and asystole. Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to arrhythmias. Severe hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The client's acute kidney injury (AKI) is likely contributing to the hyperkalemia by impairing potassium excretion.",

It is essential to start this medication promptly to improve mean arterial pressure (MAP) and perfuse vital organs. Norepinephrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing systemic vascular resistance. This leads to an increase in blood pressure and improved tissue perfusion. In cardiogenic shock, the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, resulting in hypotension and inadequate tissue oxygenation.

Transcutaneous pacing is the emergent, life-saving intervention for a client with symptomatic, hemodynamically unstable 3rd-degree AV block. Preparing the equipment immediately is a critical nursing responsibility. In a 3rd-degree AV block, there is complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity. The ventricles beat at their own intrinsic rate, which is often slow and inadequate to maintain cardiac output. Transcutaneous pacing delivers electrical impulses through the skin to stimulate ventricular contraction and increase heart rate. This helps to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion until a more permanent pacing solution can be implemented.",
