During admission history, client mentioned he lives alone and sometimes supplements his prescribed 'water pill' with one he buys online to 'save a little money and keep the swelling down.'

      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering all 0900 medications is contraindicated due to the client's presentation. The client exhibits signs of digoxin toxicity, including nausea, xanthopsia (yellowish vision), bradycardia (HR 54 bpm), frequent PVCs, and ST segment depression on the ECG. These findings, coupled with hypokalemia (2.6 mEq/L) and hypomagnesemia (1.4 mg/dL), increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias if digoxin is administered. Digoxin toxicity occurs because hypokalemia increases digoxin's binding affinity at the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, inhibiting its function and leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium overload. This can cause increased myocardial contractility and automaticity, predisposing the heart to arrhythmias.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Withholding digoxin is the priority action. The client's symptoms (nausea, xanthopsia), vital signs (bradycardia), ECG changes (PVCs, ST depression), and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) strongly suggest digoxin toxicity. Digoxin toxicity results from excessive inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in myocardial cells, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium. This can cause increased myocardial contractility and automaticity, predisposing the heart to arrhythmias. Withholding the medication prevents further accumulation of digoxin and reduces the risk of severe cardiac complications.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential due to the client's risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. The combination of digoxin toxicity, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia significantly increases myocardial excitability and automaticity. Hypokalemia enhances digoxin's effects on the heart, leading to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Continuous monitoring allows for early detection and prompt intervention with antiarrhythmic medications or other treatments as needed.",

While encouraging a potassium-rich diet is a beneficial long-term strategy for maintaining electrolyte balance, it is insufficient to address the client's acute and severe hypokalemia (2.6 mEq/L).

The client has severe hypokalemia (2.6 mEq/L) and requires potassium replacement to restore electrolyte balance and reduce the risk of digoxin-induced arrhythmias. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased potassium excretion in the urine. Withholding furosemide helps prevent further potassium loss, but potassium replacement is still necessary to correct the existing deficit.",
