Reports 'everything looks yellowish' this morning and has no appetite. States, 'I feel so nauseated, I couldn't even drink my coffee.' During admission history, client mentioned he lives alone and sometimes supplements his prescribed 'water pill' with one he buys online to 'save a little money and keep the swelling down.' Reports no chest pain but feels 'skipped heartbeats.' Currently resting in bed."
