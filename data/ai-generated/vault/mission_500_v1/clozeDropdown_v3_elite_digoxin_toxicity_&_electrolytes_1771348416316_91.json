            "withhold the scheduled dose of digoxin": "Correct. This is the priority, independent nursing action. The client has a toxic digoxin level (2.4 ng/mL), a heart rate of 54 bpm, and reports classic symptoms of toxicity (nausea, visual halos). Administering another dose would be life-threatening. The nurse must first prevent further harm.",
            "administer a potassium supplement as ordered": "Incorrect. While the client is hypokalemic (K+ 3.1 mEq/L) and will need potassium replacement, the most immediate, life-saving action is to prevent worsening the toxicity by withholding the digoxin. Administering potassium is a secondary, collaborative action.",
            "request a STAT cardiology consult": "Incorrect. While a cardiology consult will likely be necessary, the nurse's first independent action is to ensure patient safety by withholding the medication. This action must precede notification or consultation.",
            "administer the furosemide to reduce preload": "Incorrect. This action is dangerous. Furosemide is a potassium-wasting diuretic. Administering it would further lower the client's already low potassium level, which would potentiate the existing digoxin toxicity and increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias."
        },
        "2": {
            "digoxin toxicity potentiated by hypokalemia and renal impairment": "Correct. The clinical picture is a textbook presentation of digoxin toxicity. The toxic serum level (2.4 ng/mL), bradycardia (HR 54), ECG changes (PVCs, scooped STs), and subjective symptoms (nausea, yellow halos) confirm this. The risk factors are clearly identified in the data: acute-on-chronic renal impairment (Creatinine 3.8) prevents drug clearance, and hypokalemia (K+ 3.1) increases myocardial sensitivity to digoxin.",
            "decompensated heart failure with fluid overload": "Incorrect. While the client has a history of HF, the primary signs do not point to acute decompensation. The vital signs are stable (not tachycardic or hypotensive), SpO2 is normal, and there are no notes of worsening respiratory distress or crackles. The 1+ edema is likely chronic.",
            "an acute kidney injury from lisinopril": "Incorrect. Although ACE inhibitors like lisinopril can impact renal function, they are more commonly associated with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. The constellation of symptoms is specific to digoxin toxicity, not a side effect profile of lisinopril.",
            "a normal therapeutic effect of the cardiac medications": "Incorrect. Sinus bradycardia below 60 bpm, visual disturbances (xanthopsia), nausea, and a supra-therapeutic drug level are all signs of toxicity, not a desired or normal therapeutic effect."
