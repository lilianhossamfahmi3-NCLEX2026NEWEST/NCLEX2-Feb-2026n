    "1": {
      "withhold the scheduled dose of digoxin": {
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. This is the priority, independent nursing action. The client has a toxic digoxin level (2.4 ng/mL), a heart rate of 54 bpm, and reports classic symptoms of toxicity (nausea, visual halos). Administering another dose would be life-threatening. The nurse must first prevent further harm. Digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in myocardial cells, increasing intracellular sodium and calcium, leading to increased cardiac contractility. However, excessive inhibition due to high levels or increased sensitivity (e.g., hypokalemia) can cause arrhythmias and other toxic effects. Withholding the dose prevents further accumulation of the drug and potential for severe adverse events."
      },
      "administer a potassium supplement as ordered": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is hypokalemic (K+ 3.1 mEq/L) and will need potassium replacement, the most immediate, life-saving action is to prevent worsening the toxicity by withholding the digoxin. Administering potassium is a secondary, collaborative action. Hypokalemia increases the binding of digoxin to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, thus potentiating digoxin's effects and increasing the risk of toxicity. While potassium replacement is crucial, it does not address the immediate danger of the elevated digoxin level."
      },
      "request a STAT cardiology consult": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a cardiology consult will likely be necessary, the nurse's first independent action is to ensure patient safety by withholding the medication. This action must precede notification or consultation. The nurse's primary responsibility is to protect the patient from immediate harm. Waiting for a consult delays the necessary intervention."
      },
      "administer the furosemide to reduce preload": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is dangerous. Furosemide is a potassium-wasting diuretic. Administering it would further lower the client's already low potassium level, which would potentiate the existing digoxin toxicity and increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias. Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased potassium excretion. This further exacerbates hypokalemia, worsening digoxin toxicity."
      }
    },
    "2": {
      "digoxin toxicity potentiated by hypokalemia and renal impairment": {
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. The clinical picture is a textbook presentation of digoxin toxicity. The toxic serum level (2.4 ng/mL), bradycardia (HR 54), ECG changes (PVCs, scooped STs), and subjective symptoms (nausea, yellow halos) confirm this. The risk factors are clearly identified in the data: acute-on-chronic renal impairment (Creatinine 3.8) prevents drug clearance, and hypokalemia (K+ 3.1) increases myocardial sensitivity to digoxin. Digoxin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys; renal impairment reduces its clearance, leading to accumulation. Hypokalemia increases digoxin binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, enhancing its effects and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Xanthopsia (yellow halos) is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity due to its effects on retinal cells."
      },
      "decompensated heart failure with fluid overload": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has a history of HF, the primary signs do not point to acute decompensation. The vital signs are stable (not tachycardic or hypotensive), SpO2 is normal, and there are no notes of worsening respiratory distress or crackles. The 1+ edema is likely chronic. Decompensated heart failure typically presents with signs of fluid overload, such as dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, and edema. While edema is present, the absence of respiratory distress and stable vital signs make this diagnosis less likely."
      },
      "an acute kidney injury from lisinopril": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Although ACE inhibitors like lisinopril can impact renal function, they are more commonly associated with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. The constellation of symptoms is specific to digoxin toxicity, not a side effect profile of lisinopril. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone promotes potassium excretion, so ACE inhibitors can lead to potassium retention."
      },
      "a normal therapeutic effect of the cardiac medications": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Sinus bradycardia below 60 bpm, visual disturbances (xanthopsia), nausea, and a supra-therapeutic drug level are all signs of toxicity, not a desired or normal therapeutic effect. Therapeutic effects of digoxin include increased cardiac contractility and decreased heart rate, but these effects should not be accompanied by toxic symptoms or a supra-therapeutic drug level."
