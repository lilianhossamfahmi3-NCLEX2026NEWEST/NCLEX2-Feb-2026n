The client's lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L is well into the toxic range (>1.5 mEq/L). NSAIDs significantly decrease renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by inhibiting prostaglandins, which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete lithium, causing it to accumulate rapidly. The doubling of the serum creatinine (0.9 to 1.8 mg/dL) and rising BUN confirms acute kidney injury (AKI). The clinical manifestations—coarse tremors, ataxia, lethargy, nausea/vomiting, and hypotension—are classic signs of neurotoxicity. The ECG changes indicate cardiotoxicity. The absolute priority is to stop the offending agent (lithium) and immediately notify the provider for emergency interventions, which may include IV fluids and hemodialysis. Given the high risk of seizures with severe toxicity, seizure precautions are a critical safety measure.",

Encouraging large volumes of oral fluids is inappropriate for a nauseous, vomiting client and is insufficient to treat severe toxicity.
