The critically low potassium of 2.9 mEq/L is the priority. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly. Initiating insulin with hypokalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, potentially leading to cardiac arrest. Therefore, the priority is to withhold insulin, aggressively replete potassium, and continue fluid resuscitation to correct dehydration and improve perfusion. The ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U-waves) further support hypokalemia.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindication of starting insulin with a potassium level < 3.3 mEq/L is a major safety risk due to the risk of severe hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. Administering sodium bicarbonate is also contraindicated because it can worsen hypokalemia by promoting intracellular potassium shift and can also increase the risk of cerebral edema. Prioritizing non-essential actions, such as a head CT without neurological signs of cerebral edema, delays life-saving electrolyte and fluid correction.",

Starting insulin now would cause a rapid and dangerous drop in serum potassium, leading to severe cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) and potentially cardiac arrest. The standard of care is to correct potassium to at least 3.3 mEq/L before initiating insulin therapy. *Pathophysiology:* Insulin binds to receptors on cells, activating sodium-potassium ATPase, which pumps potassium into the cell. In DKA, total body potassium is often depleted due to osmotic diuresis, even if serum levels appear normal initially. Administering insulin without repletion can unmask this deficit, causing a precipitous drop.",

The ECG findings of flattened T-waves and U-waves confirm the cardiac effects of hypokalemia. Administering 10 mEq/hr is a safe rate of peripheral IV potassium replacement and is essential to stabilize the client's cardiac membrane potential. *Pathophysiology:* Hypokalemia reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more susceptible to arrhythmias. Potassium replacement restores the membrane potential, reducing the risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias.",

Correcting the underlying acidosis with insulin (once safe to give) and fluids is the appropriate treatment. *Pathophysiology:* Rapid correction of acidosis with bicarbonate can cause a rapid shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, decreasing oxygen delivery to tissues.

Neurological status should be monitored closely, but a CT is not the priority at this moment. *Pathophysiology:* Cerebral edema in DKA is thought to be related to rapid changes in serum osmolality during treatment. Risk factors include young age, severe acidosis, and rapid correction of hyperglycemia. While lethargy can be a sign of cerebral edema, it can also be due to hyperglycemia and dehydration.
