Insulin drives potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, which would rapidly worsen the hypokalemia and precipitate fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, the priority actions are to withhold insulin, aggressively replete potassium, and continue fluid resuscitation to correct dehydration and improve perfusion.",
