The immediate priority is to secure the airway and avoid any action that could precipitate complete laryngospasm and respiratory arrest. The only safe actions are those that promote oxygenation without agitating the child, prepare for definitive airway management, and maintain the child's current compensatory positioning.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent critical safety violations in the management of epiglottitis. Any procedure that might stimulate the child's pharynx (visual inspection) or cause agitation and crying (forcing a position change, painful procedures like IV insertion) can trigger laryngospasm of the inflamed airway, leading to immediate and complete obstruction. These actions must be avoided until the airway is definitively secured via intubation, typically in a controlled setting like an operating room.",

Definitive airway management via endotracheal intubation by the most experienced personnel (anesthesiology/otolaryngology) in a controlled setting (the OR) is the gold standard and life-saving intervention."

                "justification": "This is a life-threatening action and a critical contraindication.

While IV antibiotics are necessary, attempting a painful procedure like IV insertion before the airway is secured can cause significant agitation and crying, potentially triggering fatal laryngospasm. Airway management (A) and breathing support (B) are the immediate priorities. IV access should be obtained after the airway is secured."

                "justification": "This is a critical safety and comfort measure. Keeping the child calm is paramount to prevent airway compromise. The position of comfort (tripod) is self-selected by the child to maintain airway patency. The parent's presence provides psychosocial support and reduces anxiety, which helps prevent agitation and crying."
