The aide reports the client became acutely agitated about 30 minutes ago, complaining of a 'pounding, severe headache.' The aide notes the client is sweating profusely on his forehead and neck, but his legs feel cool and dry. The client has an indwelling urinary catheter. The aide states, 'His urine bag looked empty this morning, which was strange because he drank a full bottle of water a few hours ago.' The client lives alone with daily aide support following a recent discharge from a rehabilitation facility."

        "correct": "This client, with a spinal cord injury at T4, is exhibiting classic signs of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency. The noxious stimulus is most likely a distended bladder, as indicated by the aide's report of an empty drainage bag despite fluid intake. The massive sympathetic response below the level of injury causes severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. Baroreceptors detect this hypertension and stimulate a parasympathetic response (vagal nerve) above the level of injury, leading to compensatory bradycardia, headache, and diaphoresis. The immediate nursing priorities are to remove the stimulus and lower the blood pressure. Raising the head of the bed utilizes orthostatic hypotension to help lower BP. Simultaneously, the nurse must assess and relieve the most common cause: bladder distention. Monitoring focuses on the resolution of the crisis, which is indicated by the normalization of blood pressure and the restoration of urine output once the obstruction is cleared.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect actions are either contraindicated or not the immediate priority. Administering metoprolol is a critical safety error ('DON'T PROCEED'). The client's bradycardia (HR 48) is a compensatory response to the severe hypertension; a beta-blocker would block this response and could lead to severe, unopposed bradycardia and potential cardiovascular collapse. Placing the client supine would worsen the hypertension. A head CT is a diagnostic test to consider if neurological symptoms persist *after* initial interventions, but it is not the first action. The incorrect conditions do not match the clinical picture. Neurogenic shock presents with hypotension. Malignant hyperthermia involves high fever and muscle rigidity. Sepsis would typically present differently. An ischemic stroke could be a *result* of AD, but it is not the primary process. Monitoring temperature, GCS, or spasticity are not the primary parameters to evaluate the immediate resolution of this specific crisis.",
