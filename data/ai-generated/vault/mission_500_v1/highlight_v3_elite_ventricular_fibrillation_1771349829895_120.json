The team leader has identified Ventricular Fibrillation on the monitor and called for immediate defibrillation. The nurse must quickly identify and communicate any critical safety hazards before the shock is delivered. Click to highlight the findings in the event log that require an immediate safety intervention *before* proceeding with defibrillation.",

At 1017, he became profusely diaphoretic and, while reaching for a drink, spilled a large pitcher of ice water, soaking his gown, the bed linens, and the floor adjacent to the bed. At 1018, he was found unresponsive and pulseless. A Code Blue was initiated, chest compressions were started, and the cardiac monitor displays Ventricular Fibrillation.",

        "correctRationale": "This phrase describes a client and environment that are saturated with water. Water is a conductor of electricity. Proceeding with defibrillation creates a severe risk of arcing (electricity traveling over the skin instead of through the myocardium), which leads to ineffective shock delivery and potential electrical injury or electrocution of the resuscitation team. This represents a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' or 'SAFETY STOP' moment. The nurse's immediate priority is to ensure the client's chest is wiped dry and the environment is safe before the shock is delivered.",
