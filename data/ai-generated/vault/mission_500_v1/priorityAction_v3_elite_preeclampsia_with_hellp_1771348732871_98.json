A platelet count of 45,000/mm³ is a significant contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia due to the high risk of developing an epidural hematoma, which can lead to permanent paralysis. This constitutes a 'SAFETY STOP' situation. The nurse's immediate priority is to intervene before a potentially harmful procedure is performed.",

While treating the client's hypertension is important in managing preeclampsia, the blood pressure of 162/110 mmHg is not the most immediate life-threatening issue.

The platelet count of 45,000/mm³ poses a severe risk for spinal hematoma and subsequent paralysis if an epidural is placed.
