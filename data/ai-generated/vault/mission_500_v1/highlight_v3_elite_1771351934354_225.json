    "correct": "The selected text correctly identifies the classic neuromuscular and autonomic hyperactivity triad of Serotonin Syndrome, a life-threatening condition. The combination of sertraline (long washout period), new fluoxetine, PRN sumatriptan, and ondansetron has created a toxic level of serotonin. The highlighted findings (agitation, diaphoresis, rigidity, clonus) are the most direct clinical evidence of this toxicity. These signs, combined with the hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, and lab evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK, K+, Cr), indicate a medical emergency. Administering the scheduled fluoxetine, another serotonergic agent, would be catastrophic and potentially fatal. The nurse's priority is to recognize these specific toxic effects, withhold the medication, and notify the provider immediately.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Serotonin Syndrome results from excessive serotonin in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This excess can be caused by combining multiple serotonergic drugs, overdoses, or drug interactions. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, pain perception, and other functions, becomes dangerously elevated. This leads to a cascade of effects, including altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., rigidity, clonus, hyperreflexia). The severity can range from mild to life-threatening, with severe cases leading to hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and death. The key is recognizing the constellation of symptoms and acting quickly to discontinue the offending agents and provide supportive care.",
    "incorrect": "The other options are either contributory history or non-specific symptoms. While important, they are not the primary, most urgent clinical findings that signal the need to STOP the medication administration. The key to this safety-critical question is identifying the direct evidence of neuromuscular and autonomic collapse, which is the core pathology of severe Serotonin Syndrome.",

        "explanation": "This is incorrect. This statement provides critical context and explains the *etiology* of the likely problem (medication mismanagement due to fragmented care, an SDOH factor). However, it is a historical fact, not a current clinical finding of the life-threatening reaction itself. The nurse's immediate action is based on the current assessment, not the history alone."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is correct. This cluster of findings represents the hallmark triad of Serotonin Syndrome: altered mental status (agitation), autonomic hyperactivity (diaphoresis), and neuromuscular excitation (rigidity, clonus). Clonus, in particular, is a highly specific sign. These are the most dangerous and specific indicators that command the nurse to STOP and not administer another serotonergic agent."

        "explanation": "This is incorrect. While headache and disorientation are part of the clinical picture, they are non-specific. Headache can be from her known migraines or the severe hypertension. Disorientation is a mental status change, but less specific and less pathognomonic than the clonus and rigidity described in the correct option. The nurse must prioritize the most unique and dangerous signs."

    "situation": "The client is a 45-year-old female admitted for altered mental status, now exhibiting signs of possible Serotonin Syndrome.",
    "background": "The client has a history of depression and migraines. She ran out of her usual antidepressant (sertraline) a week ago and received a new prescription (fluoxetine) from urgent care yesterday. She also received ondansetron in the ED at 0715.",
    "assessment": "At 0830, the client is increasingly agitated and restless with profuse diaphoresis. Her vital signs at 0800 are HR 132, BP 180/112, RR 26, Temp 39.1°C (102.4°F), and SpO2 94% on RA. Assessment reveals muscle rigidity in her lower extremities and spontaneous clonus in her right ankle. Labs show elevated K+ (5.8 mEq/L) and CK (6,200 U/L).",
    "recommendation": "I recommend withholding the scheduled 0900 fluoxetine and notifying the provider immediately due to the high suspicion of Serotonin Syndrome. Consider interventions to manage hyperthermia and potential rhabdomyolysis. Lorazepam may be indicated for agitation, but with caution due to potential interactions. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is essential."

    "**Clonus is a KEY SIGN:** Spontaneous or inducible clonus is a highly specific sign of Serotonin Syndrome and should prompt immediate action.",

    "**Serotonin Syndrome Mimics:** Be aware that other conditions, such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), can present similarly. A careful medication history is essential for differentiation.",
    "**Supportive Care:** Management of Serotonin Syndrome focuses on discontinuing offending agents and providing supportive care, including cooling measures, benzodiazepines for agitation, and potentially cyproheptadine (a serotonin antagonist) in severe cases."
