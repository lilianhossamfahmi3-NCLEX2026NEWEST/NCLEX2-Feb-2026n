        "correct": "The selected text correctly identifies the classic neuromuscular and autonomic hyperactivity triad of Serotonin Syndrome, a life-threatening condition. The combination of sertraline (long washout period), new fluoxetine, PRN sumatriptan, and ondansetron has created a toxic level of serotonin. The highlighted findings (agitation, diaphoresis, rigidity, clonus) are the most direct clinical evidence of this toxicity. These signs, combined with the hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, and lab evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK, K+, Cr), indicate a medical emergency. Administering the scheduled fluoxetine, another serotonergic agent, would be catastrophic and potentially fatal. The nurse's priority is to recognize these specific toxic effects, withhold the medication, and notify the provider immediately.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are either contributory history or non-specific symptoms. While important, they are not the primary, most urgent clinical findings that signal the need to STOP the medication administration. The key to this safety-critical question is identifying the direct evidence of neuromuscular and autonomic collapse, which is the core pathology of severe Serotonin Syndrome.",

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. This statement provides critical context and explains the *etiology* of the likely problem (medication mismanagement due to fragmented care, an SDOH factor). However, it is a historical fact, not a current clinical finding of the life-threatening reaction itself. The nurse's immediate action is based on the current assessment, not the history alone."

                "explanation": "This is correct. This cluster of findings represents the hallmark triad of Serotonin Syndrome: altered mental status (agitation), autonomic hyperactivity (diaphoresis), and neuromuscular excitation (rigidity, clonus). Clonus, in particular, is a highly specific sign. These are the most dangerous and specific indicators that command the nurse to STOP and not administer another serotonergic agent."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. While headache and disorientation are part of the clinical picture, they are non-specific. Headache can be from her known migraines or the severe hypertension. Disorientation is a mental status change, but less specific and less pathognomonic than the clonus and rigidity described in the correct option. The nurse must prioritize the most unique and dangerous signs."
