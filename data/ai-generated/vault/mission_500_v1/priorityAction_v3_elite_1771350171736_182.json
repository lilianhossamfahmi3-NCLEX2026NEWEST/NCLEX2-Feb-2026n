Client's partner states he has not been taking his blood pressure medication regularly for the past 2 months because he 'couldn't afford the copay'.

The priority nursing actions are to prevent further harm, initiate life-saving resuscitation measures, and escalate care immediately. Withholding the labetalol is critical to prevent worsening hypotension and bradycardia. Activating the massive transfusion protocol anticipates the need for large volumes of blood products. Ensuring adequate IV access is fundamental for resuscitation. Immediate notification of the surgeon and RRT is essential for definitive treatment and advanced life support.",
