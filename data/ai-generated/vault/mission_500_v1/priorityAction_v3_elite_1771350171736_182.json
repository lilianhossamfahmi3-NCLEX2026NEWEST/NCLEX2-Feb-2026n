    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) leading to profound hemorrhagic shock. The sudden, severe abdominal and back pain (rated 10/10 and described as 'tearing'), coupled with hypotension (78/46 mmHg), tachycardia (142 bpm), a pulsatile abdominal mass, diaphoresis, pallor, and Grey Turner's sign (flank ecchymosis), strongly suggests a rupture. The elevated lactate (5.1 mmol/L) indicates anaerobic metabolism due to hypoperfusion, and the low hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL) and hematocrit (26%) confirm significant blood loss. The elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.9 mg/dL) suggest acute kidney injury secondary to hypovolemia. This is a surgical emergency. The priority nursing actions are to prevent further harm, initiate life-saving resuscitation measures, and escalate care immediately. Withholding the labetalol is critical to prevent worsening hypotension and bradycardia. Activating the massive transfusion protocol anticipates the need for large volumes of blood products. Ensuring adequate IV access is fundamental for resuscitation. Immediate notification of the surgeon and RRT is essential for definitive treatment and advanced life support.",
    "incorrect": "Administering heparin to a client with a suspected active, massive hemorrhage is a catastrophic and potentially lethal error. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits clot formation, exacerbating bleeding from the ruptured aneurysm. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position would decrease venous return and worsen hypotension in a shock state. This position promotes pooling of blood in the lower extremities, further reducing cardiac output and tissue perfusion.",

        "content": "Withhold the scheduled 0900 labetalol.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The client is in severe hypotensive shock (BP 78/46 mmHg). Labetalol is a beta-blocker that reduces blood pressure and heart rate. In the context of a ruptured AAA and hemorrhagic shock, administering labetalol would further compromise the client's already precarious hemodynamic status, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. The body's compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia, vasoconstriction) are essential to maintain perfusion; labetalol would blunt these responses."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This is a lethal 'DON'T PROCEED' action. The client has a ruptured AAA and is actively hemorrhaging into the retroperitoneal space. Heparin, an anticoagulant, inhibits the formation of blood clots. Administering heparin would prevent the body's natural clotting mechanisms from attempting to seal the rupture, thereby accelerating bleeding and potentially leading to exsanguination and death. This is a direct contraindication in the setting of active, uncontrolled hemorrhage."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a correct and proactive life-saving measure. The client's profound shock, falling hemoglobin/hematocrit, and Grey Turner's sign indicate massive blood loss. The MTP ensures the rapid availability of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets needed for resuscitation. The goal is to restore circulating volume, oxygen-carrying capacity, and clotting factors to prevent further deterioration and improve survival. The MTP streamlines the process of obtaining and administering these critical blood products."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This action is unsafe. While the client has tachypnea (30/min), it is due to shock and metabolic acidosis (high lactate), not a primary respiratory issue. High-Fowler's position would cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, decrease venous return to the heart, and severely worsen hypotension. This position reduces preload, further compromising cardiac output and tissue perfusion in a client already in a state of hypovolemic shock. The priority is to maintain cerebral perfusion, which is best achieved in a supine or Trendelenburg position (if not contraindicated)."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a fundamental and essential action in any shock state, especially hemorrhagic shock. Large-bore IVs are necessary for the rapid infusion of crystalloids (e.g., normal saline, lactated Ringer's), colloids (e.g., albumin), and blood products required for volume resuscitation. The larger the gauge, the faster the flow rate, allowing for more rapid restoration of circulating volume and blood pressure. Two IVs provide redundancy and allow for simultaneous administration of different fluids or medications."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is a critical escalation of care. A ruptured AAA requires immediate surgical intervention to stop the bleeding and repair the aneurysm. Notifying the surgeon and RRT mobilizes the necessary resources for definitive treatment and advanced hemodynamic support. The RRT can provide immediate interventions such as intubation, vasopressor administration, and advanced monitoring while awaiting surgical intervention. Time is of the essence in this situation, as mortality increases significantly with each passing minute."

    "Ruptured AAA presents with sudden, severe abdominal/back pain ('tearing' sensation), hypotension, tachycardia, pulsatile abdominal mass, and signs of shock. Grey Turner's sign (flank ecchymosis) indicates retroperitoneal bleeding. Consider the 'lethal triad' of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy in severe hemorrhage.",
    "In suspected ruptured AAA, avoid interventions that worsen hypotension (e.g., high-Fowler's position, antihypertensives). Rapid fluid resuscitation and blood product administration are crucial. Permissive hypotension (MAP of 60-65 mmHg) may be considered to avoid dislodging clots until surgical control is achieved.",
    "Heparin is absolutely contraindicated in active hemorrhage. Always assess for contraindications before administering medications. Use the 'five rights' of medication administration (right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, right time) and the 'three checks' (when retrieving, when preparing, and before administering) to minimize medication errors.",
    "Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) activation ensures rapid access to blood products in cases of severe hemorrhage. Monitor for complications of massive transfusion, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).",
