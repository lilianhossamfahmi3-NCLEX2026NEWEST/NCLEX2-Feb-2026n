Admitted yesterday for shortness of breath and a 4 kg weight gain over 3 days. Client states he 'sometimes forgets' to take his furosemide and potassium chloride because 'it's too many pills and too expensive.' Currently alert, anxious, reporting mild chest tightness. Skin is pale and diaphoretic.\n\n**10:33:** While speaking with the client, he became unresponsive. No palpable carotid pulse. Code Blue initiated. Chest compressions started immediately. Bag-valve-mask ventilations initiated."

        "correct": "The defibrillator display indicates 'SYNC MODE ON'. Synchronized cardioversion is used for unstable tachyarrhythmias that have an identifiable QRS complex (e.g., atrial fibrillation, SVT, ventricular tachycardia with a pulse). The machine attempts to deliver the shock on the R-wave to avoid inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). The client's rhythm is ventricular fibrillation, which is chaotic electrical activity with no identifiable QRS complexes. In this state, the defibrillator in sync mode will not deliver a shock because it cannot detect an R-wave to synchronize with. This will fatally delay the single most critical intervention for VF. The nurse's immediate, life-saving action is to recognize this critical equipment misconfiguration and turn OFF the sync mode to allow for an immediate asynchronous shock (defibrillation). This is a classic 'Don't Proceed' / 'Safety Stop' moment.",

Because the defibrillator is in 'SYNC MODE', pressing the shock button will not deliver a shock to a client in ventricular fibrillation.
