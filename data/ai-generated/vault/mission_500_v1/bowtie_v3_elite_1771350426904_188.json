        "correct": "The client's presentation of sudden severe hypertension (224/118 mmHg), profound bradycardia (HR 46), pounding headache, and flushing/diaphoresis above the level of the C6 spinal cord injury are classic signs of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD). This is a life-threatening emergency caused by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury (in this case, a kinked urinary catheter leading to bladder distention). The priority nursing actions are to immediately sit the client upright (90 degrees) to use gravity to help lower cerebral blood pressure, and then to promptly identify and remove the noxious stimulus. After elevating the head of the bed, the nurse must assess for bladder distention and correct the catheter issue. Loosening restrictive clothing is also indicated. Because the client is already severely bradycardic due to the unopposed vagal response, the standing order for labetalol (a beta-blocker) is contraindicated as it would worsen bradycardia and could lead to cardiac arrest. The appropriate pharmacological intervention, if initial measures fail to lower BP, is the prescribed fast-acting vasodilator, hydralazine, which does not have a negative chronotropic effect.",
        "incorrect": "The most critical error a nurse could make is to administer the PRN labetalol. This action represents a failure to recognize the 'Safety Stop' moment. Labetalol, having both alpha- and beta-blocking properties, would dangerously potentiate the already severe bradycardia caused by the body's compensatory parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. Placing the client supine would increase cerebral pressure and worsen the hypertension, which is the opposite of the required intervention. Focusing on chronic lab values (BUN/Cr) or irrelevant normals (troponin) distracts from the acute, life-threatening neurological emergency.",
