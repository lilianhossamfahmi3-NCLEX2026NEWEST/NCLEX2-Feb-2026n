The client's BP has remained persistently above this threshold (208/116, 196/110, 192/108 mmHg). Administering tPA in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension dramatically increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion of the ischemic stroke.

The primary purpose of the non-contrast CT is to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke.

Such a high score strengthens the rationale for urgent reperfusion therapy to salvage ischemic brain tissue (the penumbra) and potentially improve the client's functional outcome.

While hyperglycemia should be managed as it can worsen outcomes, it is not an absolute contraindication to tPA. Only profound hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL), which can mimic stroke symptoms, would be a reason to withhold and correct before proceeding."
