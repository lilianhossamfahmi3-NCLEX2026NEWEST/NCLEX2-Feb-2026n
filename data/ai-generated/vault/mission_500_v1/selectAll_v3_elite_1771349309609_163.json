Alteplase, a thrombolytic, is contraindicated with an INR >1.7 due to the high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), prolonging the prothrombin time and INR. Administering alteplase in this state can lead to uncontrolled bleeding in the brain, causing further neurological damage or death. The nurse must withhold alteplase and notify the provider immediately.",

Consider administering vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) to reverse the effects of warfarin if time permits and the patient is a candidate for alteplase after reversal."

Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic stroke. High blood pressure can damage the already compromised blood vessels in the brain, leading to bleeding when a thrombolytic agent is introduced. The nurse must withhold alteplase and administer antihypertensive medications, such as labetalol, to lower the blood pressure to a safe range before considering thrombolysis.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Strict blood pressure control is crucial before and during alteplase administration. Use antihypertensive medications as per stroke protocol to achieve target blood pressure levels. Monitor BP frequently (every 15 minutes) during and after alteplase infusion."

The therapeutic window is based on the understanding that ischemic brain tissue (the penumbra) is potentially salvageable within this timeframe. Beyond this window, the risk of hemorrhage outweighs the potential benefit. Since the client is within the window, this is not a reason to withhold alteplase.",

While a very high score (>25) might raise concerns about increased risk of hemorrhage, it is generally considered an indication for alteplase in eligible patients. The NIHSS quantifies the severity of the stroke and helps guide treatment decisions. A higher score suggests a greater potential benefit from thrombolytic therapy if administered within the appropriate timeframe and without contraindications.",

Severe hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL) can mimic stroke symptoms and must be corrected before alteplase administration. Hyperglycemia can worsen ischemic brain injury, but it does not pose an immediate risk of hemorrhage like an elevated INR or uncontrolled hypertension. The glucose level should be managed with insulin as needed, but alteplase should not be withheld solely based on this glucose level.",
