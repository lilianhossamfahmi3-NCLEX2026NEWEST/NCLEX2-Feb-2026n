    "correct": "The serum potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L is a critical finding that represents a contraindication to starting an insulin infusion. Insulin facilitates the intracellular movement of potassium along with glucose via the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. In a client who is already hypokalemic (or at the low end of normal), initiating an insulin infusion will rapidly worsen hypokalemia. This can lead to life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation due to altered myocardial cell excitability. Furthermore, severe hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, potentially leading to respiratory failure due to impaired diaphragmatic function. The standard of care is to correct the potassium level to at least 3.3 mEq/L (and often >3.5 mEq/L) *before* starting insulin to prevent these complications. The nurse must withhold the insulin, administer the ordered potassium replacement, and notify the provider using SBAR communication.",
    "incorrect": "The other highlighted options are expected findings in HHS or are not the most immediate life-threatening contraindication to therapy. While concerning, they are part of the clinical picture that the prescribed treatments aim to correct.
