The client's deteriorating vital signs (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, hypoxia) indicate a life-threatening complication, likely a tension pneumothorax or a large bronchopleural fistula. Administering an opioid like hydromorphone would depress the client's respiratory drive and mental status, masking further deterioration and potentially leading to respiratory arrest."

            "rationale": "Correct. The sudden onset of continuous, vigorous bubbling, combined with severe dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia, is highly suggestive of a tension pneumothorax. This is a medical emergency. The nurse's priority assessment is to check for cardinal signs, including tracheal deviation (a late and ominous sign), unilateral chest expansion, and spreading subcutaneous emphysema."

Lowering the head of the bed would increase the work of breathing for a client already in severe respiratory distress and could worsen hypotension. The client should be placed in a high-Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position to facilitate lung expansion and ease the work of breathing."

Activating the RRT or calling a code is essential to bring immediate, expert help to the bedside for advanced interventions."

If the source of the massive air leak is the client (e.g., a bronchopleural fistula), clamping the tube would block the only exit for the air. This would rapidly convert a large pneumothorax into a tension pneumothorax, causing complete cardiovascular collapse."

        "opt6": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The nurse should anticipate the needs for emergency intervention. The new, continuous, vigorous bubbling coupled with clinical decompensation suggests a major problem with the chest drainage system or a new pulmonary injury. This requires urgent provider intervention, which will likely involve bedside thoracostomy, repositioning, or replacing the current chest tube. The nurse must prepare the necessary equipment (e.g., new drainage system, thoracostomy tray)."
