      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The client's deteriorating vital signs (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, hypoxia) indicate a life-threatening complication, most likely a tension pneumothorax or a large bronchopleural fistula. Administering hydromorphone, an opioid, would further depress the respiratory drive and mental status, masking further deterioration and potentially leading to respiratory arrest. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action. In a tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This compresses the lung, shifts mediastinal structures, and reduces venous return to the heart, causing obstructive shock.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In a patient with a chest tube and sudden respiratory distress, always prioritize assessing for signs of tension pneumothorax before administering pain medication. Opioids can mask critical symptoms and worsen respiratory compromise."
    },
    "opt2": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The sudden onset of continuous, vigorous bubbling in the water seal chamber, combined with severe dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia, is highly suggestive of a tension pneumothorax or a significant air leak. This is a medical emergency. The nurse's priority assessment is to check for cardinal signs, including tracheal deviation (a late and ominous sign due to mediastinal shift), unilateral chest expansion, and spreading subcutaneous emphysema (air leaking into subcutaneous tissues). Subcutaneous emphysema occurs when air escapes from the lung or airway and becomes trapped under the skin.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Tracheal deviation is a late sign of tension pneumothorax. Early recognition of other signs, such as increased respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema, and changes in chest tube drainage, is crucial for prompt intervention."
    },
    "opt3": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Lowering the head of the bed is contraindicated. This position would increase the work of breathing for a client already in severe respiratory distress and could worsen hypotension. The client should be placed in a high-Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position to facilitate lung expansion and ease the work of breathing. Elevating the head of the bed allows for better diaphragmatic excursion and improved ventilation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Positioning a patient with respiratory distress in a high-Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position can significantly improve lung expansion and ease breathing. Avoid supine positioning in patients with respiratory compromise."
    },
    "opt4": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The client is experiencing a medical emergency with signs of impending obstructive shock (hypotension, tachycardia) and respiratory failure (tachypnea, hypoxia). Activating the RRT or calling a code is essential to bring immediate, expert help to the bedside for advanced interventions. The RRT can provide advanced airway management, administer medications to support blood pressure, and prepare for more invasive procedures such as needle thoracostomy or chest tube reinsertion.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Early activation of the Rapid Response Team (RRT) can prevent further deterioration and improve patient outcomes in critical situations. Do not hesitate to call for help when a patient's condition is rapidly declining."
    },
    "opt5": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Clamping the chest tube in this situation is a dangerous action that could be fatal. If the source of the massive air leak is the client (e.g., a bronchopleural fistula or a pulmonary laceration), clamping the tube would block the only exit for the air. This would rapidly convert a large pneumothorax into a tension pneumothorax, causing complete cardiovascular collapse. A tension pneumothorax can lead to decreased cardiac output and death if not promptly treated.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Never clamp a chest tube in a patient with a known or suspected air leak without a specific order from a healthcare provider. Clamping can lead to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. The only exception is during brief changes of the drainage system, and even then, it should be done cautiously."
    },
    "opt6": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The nurse should anticipate the need for emergency intervention. The new, continuous, vigorous bubbling coupled with clinical decompensation suggests a major problem with the chest drainage system or a new pulmonary injury. This requires urgent provider intervention, which will likely involve bedside thoracostomy, repositioning, or replacing the current chest tube. The nurse must prepare the necessary equipment (e.g., new drainage system, thoracostomy tray, sterile supplies) to facilitate rapid intervention.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Rapid preparation for chest tube reinsertion or replacement can significantly improve patient outcomes in cases of chest tube malfunction or displacement. Anticipate the provider's needs and have necessary equipment readily available."
