    "cueAnalysis": "The client presents with critical findings suggestive of a ruptured or leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) graft post-EVAR. Key cues include: **sudden onset of severe, tearing back pain (9/10)**, **hypotension (94/58 mmHg)**, **tachycardia (122 bpm)**, **tachypnea (24 breaths/min)**, **decreasing SpO2 (93%)**, **pale, cool, and diaphoretic skin**, **abdominal distention**, and a **significant drop in hemoglobin (12.5 to 9.1 g/dL) and hematocrit (37% to 27%)**. Elevated BUN (32 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) indicate potential renal hypoperfusion secondary to hypovolemia. These cues collectively point to a life-threatening emergency: hypovolemic shock due to internal hemorrhage.",
    "actionAnalysis": "The priority is to immediately stabilize the client and prepare for emergent surgical intervention. Delaying treatment increases the risk of irreversible organ damage and death. The nurse must recognize the signs of shock and the potential for rapid deterioration. Actions that could worsen the client's condition, such as ambulation or administering medications that could further decrease blood pressure, are contraindicated.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "**[+]** This is the priority action. The client's presentation indicates a high probability of a ruptured or leaking AAA graft, leading to internal hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. Activating the rapid response team (RRT) brings immediate critical care expertise to the bedside for resuscitation and stabilization. Notifying the surgeon ensures prompt surgical intervention to repair the leak and control the bleeding. This addresses the underlying cause and provides the best chance of survival. **Clinical Pearl:** Time is critical in managing AAA rupture. Every minute of delay increases mortality. The RRT can initiate interventions such as fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration while awaiting surgical intervention. **Pathophysiology:** Aneurysm rupture leads to massive blood loss into the retroperitoneal space, causing hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, and subsequent shock. The 'tearing' pain is caused by the dissection of blood through the layers of the aorta. Rapid intervention is needed to restore blood volume and prevent end-organ damage."

        "justification": "**[-]** Administering hydromorphone is contraindicated at this time. While pain management is important, masking the pain without addressing the underlying cause can delay diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, opioids can cause vasodilation and hypotension, which would exacerbate the client's hypovolemic shock. **Clinical Pearl:** In a client with suspected internal bleeding, pain medication should be withheld until the cause of the pain is identified and addressed. **Pathophysiology:** Hydromorphone, an opioid analgesic, can cause vasodilation, leading to a further decrease in blood pressure and potentially worsening the client's hemodynamic instability. It also masks the pain, which is a critical indicator of the ongoing hemorrhage."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "**[-]** Ambulation is absolutely contraindicated. The client is hemodynamically unstable and likely experiencing internal bleeding. Ambulation would increase intra-abdominal pressure and cardiac demand, potentially exacerbating the bleeding and leading to further deterioration. **Clinical Pearl:** Never ambulate a client who is hypotensive, tachycardic, or showing signs of internal bleeding. **Pathophysiology:** Increased physical activity increases cardiac output and blood pressure, which can worsen the bleeding from the ruptured aneurysm. Ambulation also increases intra-abdominal pressure, which can further disrupt the clot formation and exacerbate the hemorrhage."

        "option": "Place the client on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "**[-]** While supplemental oxygen is a reasonable supportive measure, it is not the priority. The client's SpO2 is only mildly decreased (93%), and the primary problem is hypovolemic shock due to blood loss, not respiratory failure. Addressing the hemorrhage is paramount. **Clinical Pearl:** Oxygen administration is a supportive measure but does not address the underlying cause of hypoxemia in hypovolemic shock. **Pathophysiology:** Hypoxemia in hypovolemic shock is primarily due to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues secondary to reduced cardiac output and blood volume. While supplemental oxygen can increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, it does not address the underlying problem of decreased blood flow."

        "option": "Apply a pressure dressing to the right femoral access site.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "**[-]** The nurse's notes indicate that the femoral access site is clean, dry, and intact. The client's symptoms (severe back pain, abdominal distention, and hemodynamic instability) strongly suggest an internal hemorrhage, not bleeding from the femoral access site. Applying a pressure dressing to the femoral site would be a distraction from the true problem and delay necessary interventions. **Clinical Pearl:** Focus on the most critical and life-threatening problems first. Do not be distracted by minor or unrelated findings. **Pathophysiology:** The femoral access site is unlikely to be the source of the bleeding, given the client's symptoms and the nurse's assessment. The symptoms are more consistent with a retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured aneurysm graft."
