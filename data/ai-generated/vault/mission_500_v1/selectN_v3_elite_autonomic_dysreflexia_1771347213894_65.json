      "rationale": "INCORRECT. This is a critical safety error. The client is experiencing a hypertensive crisis (BP 188/102). Midodrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, leading to vasoconstriction and increased peripheral resistance, thereby elevating blood pressure. In autonomic dysreflexia, the body is already experiencing an exaggerated sympathetic response. Administering midodrine would dangerously exacerbate the hypertension, potentially leading to severe complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or seizure. This medication must be withheld immediately.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Never administer a medication that will worsen a patient's current critical condition. Always assess vital signs and understand the medication's mechanism of action before administration. In autonomic dysreflexia, avoid medications that increase blood pressure.",
      "pathophysiology": "Autonomic dysreflexia is characterized by an exaggerated sympathetic response due to a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury. This leads to unopposed vasoconstriction, resulting in a rapid and severe increase in blood pressure. Midodrine, by further promoting vasoconstriction, would exacerbate this already dangerous physiological state."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. The client's presentation (acute hypertension, bradycardia, flushing above the T4 injury level, headache) is classic for autonomic dysreflexia. The immediate priority is to sit the client upright (high-Fowler's position) to induce orthostatic hypotension. This position promotes venous pooling in the lower extremities, which helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of intracranial pressure. This is a rapid intervention while further assessment is performed.",
      "clinicalPearl": "High-Fowler's position is a rapid intervention to lower blood pressure in patients experiencing autonomic dysreflexia.",
      "pathophysiology": "Autonomic dysreflexia causes a surge in blood pressure due to unopposed sympathetic activity below the level of the spinal cord injury. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous pooling, reducing venous return to the heart and subsequently lowering blood pressure. This counteracts the hypertensive effects of the dysreflexia. The baroreceptors above the level of the lesion are triggered by the hypertension, causing bradycardia."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. While antihypertensives like labetalol may be necessary if the condition persists despite initial interventions, the primary nursing responsibility is to first attempt to identify and remove the noxious stimulus causing the autonomic dysreflexia. Pharmacological intervention is a secondary measure after non-pharmacological actions have been implemented. Administering labetalol without addressing the underlying cause may only mask the symptoms and delay definitive treatment.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Address the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia before administering medications. Non-pharmacological interventions are the first line of defense.",
      "pathophysiology": "Autonomic dysreflexia is triggered by a noxious stimulus. Removing the stimulus is crucial to resolving the episode. While labetalol can lower blood pressure, it does not address the underlying cause and the hypertension may return if the stimulus persists."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. The most common cause of autonomic dysreflexia is a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury, with bladder distention from a blocked or kinked Foley catheter being the most frequent trigger. The nurse must immediately assess for and correct this potential cause by checking for kinks, sediment, or other obstructions in the catheter. If the catheter is blocked, it may need to be irrigated or replaced per protocol.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Bladder distention is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. Always assess Foley catheter patency in patients with spinal cord injuries presenting with symptoms.",
      "pathophysiology": "Bladder distention activates sensory nerves below the level of the spinal cord injury. Because the spinal cord injury prevents normal communication to the brain, the body responds with an exaggerated sympathetic reflex, leading to vasoconstriction and hypertension. Relieving the distention removes the stimulus and helps resolve the dysreflexia."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. Any constrictive device or clothing can act as the noxious stimulus. The Nurses' Note mentions a tight surgical dressing and an abdominal binder. These are potential triggers that must be assessed and loosened immediately as part of the search for the cause of the dysreflexia. The nurse should also assess for other potential sources of constriction, such as tight shoes or restrictive clothing.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Tight clothing or dressings can trigger autonomic dysreflexia. Loosening constrictive items is a crucial intervention.",
      "pathophysiology": "Constriction can stimulate sensory nerves below the level of the spinal cord injury, triggering the autonomic dysreflexia response. Loosening the constrictive items removes this stimulus, helping to resolve the episode."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. This action is dangerous and contraindicated. Placing the client in a supine or Trendelenburg position will increase venous return and further elevate the already dangerously high blood pressure, increasing the risk of a cerebrovascular event. The goal is to reduce blood pressure, and this position will exacerbate the hypertension.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid placing patients with autonomic dysreflexia in supine or Trendelenburg positions, as this can exacerbate hypertension.",
      "pathophysiology": "Supine and Trendelenburg positions increase venous return to the heart, leading to increased cardiac output and further elevation of blood pressure. This is the opposite of what is needed in a patient experiencing autonomic dysreflexia."
