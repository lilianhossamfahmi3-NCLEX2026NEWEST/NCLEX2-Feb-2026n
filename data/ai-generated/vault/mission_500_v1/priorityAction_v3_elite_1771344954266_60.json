The classic triad is present: 1) Respiratory distress (tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia), 2) Neurological changes (confusion, agitation, restlessness), and 3) a petechial rash. These symptoms typically appear 12-72 hours after a long bone fracture. The laboratory finding of thrombocytopenia (platelets 125,000/mm³) further supports this diagnosis. Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant used for DVT prophylaxis. Administering it to a client with FES and thrombocytopenia is absolutely contraindicated as it dramatically increases the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage, particularly intracerebral bleeding, given the client's acute neurological decline. The immediate priority action is to prevent iatrogenic harm by withholding the medication ('SAFETY STOP') and urgently escalating care by notifying the provider of this critical change in status.",

While enoxaparin is appropriately ordered for DVT prophylaxis in a post-operative orthopedic client, the new clinical picture strongly suggests FES. The petechial rash and thrombocytopenia are signs of microvascular occlusion and hemorrhage. Administering an anticoagulant would exacerbate bleeding risk and could lead to a fatal intracerebral or pulmonary hemorrhage."

However, it does not address the primary safety risk: the imminent administration of a contraindicated medication. The highest priority is to first prevent a catastrophic iatrogenic event.

The nurse has correctly identified a severe contraindication to the scheduled medication based on the overwhelming evidence of FES.
