      "rationale": "Correct - Rank 1. The client is exhibiting signs of digoxin toxicity, including bradycardia (HR 52 bpm), nausea, and blurry vision. The ECG shows PVCs and ST segment scooping, further supporting this. The lab results reveal hypokalemia (K+ 2.9 mEq/L), which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, and elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating impaired renal function, which reduces digoxin excretion. The digoxin level is 1.9 ng/mL, near the upper limit of the therapeutic range, increasing the risk of toxicity in the presence of hypokalemia and renal impairment. **Pathophysiology:** Digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in myocardial cells, increasing intracellular sodium and calcium, leading to increased cardiac contractility. Hypokalemia enhances digoxin's effects, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Impaired renal function reduces digoxin excretion, leading to accumulation. **Clinical Pearl:** Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. **SBAR:** Situation: 82-year-old female admitted for heart failure exacerbation. Background: Receiving digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and potassium chloride. Assessment: HR 52 bpm, nausea, blurry vision, K+ 2.9 mEq/L, BUN 38 mg/dL, creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL, PVCs, ST scooping. Recommendation: Withhold digoxin 0900 dose due to suspected toxicity.",

This allows the provider to order further diagnostic tests (e.g., repeat digoxin level, electrolytes, renal function tests) and initiate appropriate treatment, such as digoxin immune Fab (Digibind) if indicated. **Pathophysiology:** Prompt communication ensures timely intervention to prevent further complications of digoxin toxicity, such as life-threatening arrhythmias. **Clinical Pearl:** Digoxin toxicity can be life-threatening, requiring prompt recognition and treatment. **SBAR:** Situation: 82-year-old female admitted for heart failure exacerbation, suspected digoxin toxicity. Background: Receiving digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and potassium chloride. Assessment: HR 52 bpm, nausea, blurry vision, K+ 2.9 mEq/L, BUN 38 mg/dL, creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL, PVCs, ST scooping.

While the client already reported blurry vision, a focused assessment for halos provides more specific information to report to the provider. **Pathophysiology:** Digoxin can affect the retina and optic nerve, leading to visual disturbances. **Clinical Pearl:** Visual disturbances are a common early sign of digoxin toxicity. **SBAR:** Situation: 82-year-old female admitted for heart failure exacerbation, suspected digoxin toxicity. Background: Receiving digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and potassium chloride. Assessment: HR 52 bpm, nausea, blurry vision, K+ 2.9 mEq/L, BUN 38 mg/dL, creatinine 1.9 mg/mL, digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL, PVCs, ST scooping.

Administering the scheduled potassium chloride is important to correct the electrolyte imbalance. However, this action is secondary to withholding the digoxin and notifying the provider, who may order a different potassium replacement regimen (e.g., IV potassium). **Pathophysiology:** Hypokalemia increases the binding of digoxin to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, increasing the risk of toxicity. **Clinical Pearl:** Potassium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving digoxin. **SBAR:** Situation: 82-year-old female admitted for heart failure exacerbation, suspected digoxin toxicity. Background: Receiving digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and potassium chloride. Assessment: HR 52 bpm, nausea, blurry vision, K+ 2.9 mEq/L, BUN 38 mg/dL, creatinine 1.9 ng/mL, digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL, PVCs, ST scooping.

The nausea is a symptom of the underlying digoxin toxicity, and addressing the life-threatening cause is paramount. **Pathophysiology:** Digoxin toxicity can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. **Clinical Pearl:** Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms of digoxin toxicity. **SBAR:** Situation: 82-year-old female admitted for heart failure exacerbation, suspected digoxin toxicity. Background: Receiving digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and potassium chloride. Assessment: HR 52 bpm, nausea, blurry vision, K+ 2.9 mEq/L, BUN 38 mg/dL, creatinine 1.9 ng/mL, digoxin level 1.9 ng/mL, PVCs, ST scooping.
