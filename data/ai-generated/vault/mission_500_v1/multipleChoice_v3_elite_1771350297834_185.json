The key cues are the sudden onset of hypotension, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds on one side, and high peak pressure alarms. This is an obstructive shock state where air trapped in the pleural space compresses the heart and great vessels, preventing ventricular filling and causing cardiovascular collapse. Increasing propofol, a sedative with hypotensive effects, would be catastrophic. The priority is to recognize this emergency ('STOP' the planned action) and prepare for the immediate life-saving intervention, which is needle decompression followed by chest tube placement.",

The primary problem is not vasodilation, but the physical compression of the heart.
