Report indicates client is a 45-year-old male with a history of compensated chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. Client lives alone in a manufactured home and sustained full-thickness burns to the anterior torso and entire left arm from a space heater fire. Lactated Ringer's (LR) infusion was initiated 7 hours ago per Parkland formula calculation (475 mL/hr).<br><br><b>1000 (Current):</b> Client is increasingly restless and anxious. On auscultation, new-onset fine crackles are noted in bilateral lung bases, audible halfway up the posterior chest. Cough is now productive of small amounts of frothy, pink-tinged sputum. 2+ pitting edema is present in the unburned right lower extremity. Urine output via indwelling catheter was 110 mL in the last hour; urine is clear yellow."
