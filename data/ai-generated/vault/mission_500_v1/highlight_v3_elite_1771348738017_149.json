Lungs with bibasilar crackles halfway up. 3+ pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities. Alert and oriented x4, anxious. Reports running out of furosemide last week and was unable to get a ride to the pharmacy. IV Furosemide 40 mg given. On 2L NC.\n\n**0400:** Called to room for restlessness. Patient is attempting to get out of bed, stating 'I can't breathe.' Skin is cool and clammy to touch. Respirations labored. Oxygen increased to 6L via NC. Provider paged and updated; awaiting orders. Urine output in last 4 hours is only 75 mL."

This is a life-threatening state where the heart fails as a pump, leading to inadequate end-organ perfusion. Administering the scheduled carvedilol (a beta-blocker) would worsen myocardial contractility and heart rate. Administering lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) would cause further vasodilation and a catastrophic drop in blood pressure. These medications must be withheld, and the provider must be notified immediately for urgent intervention, likely including inotropic support.",
