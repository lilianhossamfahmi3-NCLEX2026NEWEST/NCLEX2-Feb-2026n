Lungs with bibasilar crackles halfway up. 3+ pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities. Alert and oriented x4, anxious. Reports running out of furosemide last week and was unable to get a ride to the pharmacy. IV Furosemide 40 mg given. On 2L NC.\n\n**0400 (4:00 AM):** Called to room for restlessness. Patient is attempting to get out of bed, stating 'I can't breathe.' Skin is cool and clammy to touch. Respirations labored. Oxygen increased to 6L via NC. Provider paged and updated; awaiting orders. Urine output in last 4 hours is only 75 mL."

    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The cool, clammy skin indicates poor peripheral perfusion due to vasoconstriction, a compensatory mechanism to shunt blood to vital organs. The hypotension (BP 86/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 128 bpm) reflect the heart's inability to maintain adequate cardiac output. The elevated lactate (4.2 mmol/L) signifies anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia due to inadequate oxygen delivery. Carvedilol, a beta-blocker, would further decrease heart rate and contractility, worsening the shock. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, would cause vasodilation, further reducing blood pressure. Both medications are contraindicated in this situation and must be withheld. The provider needs to be notified immediately for potential interventions such as inotropic support and vasopressors to improve cardiac output and blood pressure.",
