            "opt_1": "This is incorrect. While hypertension is a concern, current guidelines state that blood pressure must be lowered to and maintained at or below 185/110 mmHg before initiating alteplase. The client's current blood pressure of 175/95 mmHg, following the administration of labetalol, is within the acceptable range for treatment. Therefore, this finding does not require withholding the medication.",
            "opt_2": "This is incorrect. A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration due to the increased risk of hemorrhage. The client's platelet count of 105,000/mm³ is above this critical threshold. While it is on the lower end of the normal range and warrants monitoring, it is not a contraindication for initiating therapy.",
            "opt_3": "This is correct. A history of recent, significant bleeding is a critical safety concern. According to AHA/ASA guidelines, gastrointestinal or genitourinary hemorrhage within the preceding 21 days is an absolute contraindication for alteplase. The client's report of a 'stomach bleed' 15 days ago presents an unacceptably high risk of life-threatening systemic hemorrhage if a thrombolytic is administered. This finding is a 'SAFETY STOP' that requires the nurse to withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider.",
            "opt_4": "This is incorrect. Although advanced age increases the risk of complications, age greater than 80 years is considered a relative, not absolute, contraindication. For a 78-year-old client, age alone is not a reason to withhold alteplase, especially when the potential benefits of reversing a debilitating stroke are considered. The decision is based on a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis, not a strict age cutoff."
