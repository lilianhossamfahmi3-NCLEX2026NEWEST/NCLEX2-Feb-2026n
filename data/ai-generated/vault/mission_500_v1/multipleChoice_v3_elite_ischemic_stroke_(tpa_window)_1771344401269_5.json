The pharmacist has delivered the medication, and the stroke team is on standby. Based on the client's electronic health record, which finding requires the nurse to immediately contact the provider and recommend withholding the medication?",

      "opt_1": "Incorrect. [-] While hypertension is a concern in acute stroke management, current guidelines require blood pressure to be consistently below 185/110 mmHg *before* initiating alteplase. The client's BP of 175/95 mmHg, achieved post-labetalol, meets this criterion. \n\n*Pathophysiology*: Uncontrolled hypertension significantly elevates the risk of intracranial hemorrhage following thrombolytic administration. Labetalol effectively reduces BP to a safer range.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Always verify the most recent BP reading and antihypertensive administration times before alteplase initiation.",
      "opt_2": "Incorrect. [-] A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ is an *absolute* contraindication for alteplase due to the heightened risk of bleeding. This client's platelet count of 105,000/mm³ is slightly low but *above* the critical threshold.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: Alteplase's thrombolytic action combined with thrombocytopenia (low platelets) impairs the body's ability to form clots, increasing hemorrhage risk.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Always review complete blood counts (CBC) meticulously before administering alteplase.",
      "opt_3": "Correct. [+] A recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is a *critical* contraindication for alteplase. AHA/ASA guidelines state that GI or genitourinary hemorrhage within the past 21 days is an *absolute* contraindication.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: Alteplase promotes fibrinolysis, dissolving clots. In a patient with a recent GI bleed, this can disrupt the healing process and trigger life-threatening hemorrhage from the previously injured site.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Thoroughly investigate the patient's bleeding history, including source, severity, and timing, before alteplase administration. A recent GI bleed poses a significant safety risk.\n\n**SBAR Communication Example (1345):**\n\n*   **Situation:** I'm calling about [Client Name], who presented with acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Alteplase is ordered.\n*   **Background:** Last known well was 1030. NIHSS score is 15. CT head shows no hemorrhage. The spouse reports a GI bleed 15 days ago.\n*   **Assessment:** The client's recent GI bleed is an absolute contraindication for alteplase per AHA/ASA guidelines.\n*   **Recommendation:** I recommend withholding alteplase and discussing alternative treatment options due to the high risk of hemorrhage.",
      "opt_4": "Incorrect. [-] While advanced age (>80 years) is a *relative* contraindication, age 78 alone is *not* a reason to withhold alteplase. The decision requires a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis.\n\n*Pathophysiology*: Advanced age is associated with increased frailty and a higher likelihood of comorbidities, which can elevate the risk of complications from thrombolytic therapy.\n\n*Clinical Pearl*: Age should be considered alongside other factors, such as stroke severity, comorbidities, and overall health status, when deciding about alteplase."
