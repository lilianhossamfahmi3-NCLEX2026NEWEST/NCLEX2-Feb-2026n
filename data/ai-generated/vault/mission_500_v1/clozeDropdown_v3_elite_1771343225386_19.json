Key indicators include a progressive decline in blood pressure (hypotension: 90/54 mmHg), cool and diaphoretic skin, thready pulses, new lung crackles (pulmonary edema), and laboratory evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (elevated lactate, rising creatinine/BUN). Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Administering it to a hemodynamically unstable, hypotensive client is contraindicated as it will further decrease cardiac contractility and blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's paramount responsibility is patient safety, which in this case means recognizing the contraindication, withholding the unsafe medication, and immediately communicating the critical assessment findings to the provider for a change in the plan of care (e.g., considering electrical cardioversion or vasopressor support).",
