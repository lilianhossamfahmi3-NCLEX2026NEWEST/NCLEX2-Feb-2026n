A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for alteplase administration due to the profound risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Alteplase works by dissolving clots, and with an insufficient number of platelets, the client has a severely impaired ability to form new clots to stop any potential bleeding. Proceeding with administration would be a critical safety error.",

Option C, while addressing the elevated blood pressure (which must be <185/110 mmHg for tPA), is not the priority because an absolute contraindication (thrombocytopenia) already exists, making the blood pressure management for tPA administration a moot point. Option D is not indicated at this time as there is no sign of seizure activity, and it fails to address the imminent medication safety risk.",
