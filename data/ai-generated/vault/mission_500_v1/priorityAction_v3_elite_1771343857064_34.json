    "correct": "The nurse's priority action is to withhold the alteplase and immediately notify the provider. The client's platelet count is critically low at 45,000/mm³, indicating severe thrombocytopenia. Alteplase, a thrombolytic, dissolves clots. In the presence of thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/mm³), the risk of uncontrolled bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, is significantly elevated. The body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding is severely compromised. Administering alteplase in this situation is contraindicated and could be fatal. Immediate notification of the provider is crucial to discuss alternative treatment options.",
    "incorrect": "Option A is incorrect and extremely dangerous. Administering alteplase with a platelet count of 45,000/mm³ would likely result in a catastrophic and potentially fatal hemorrhage. Option C is incorrect because while the blood pressure is elevated, the thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication to alteplase, making blood pressure management secondary. Option D is incorrect because there is no current indication of seizure activity. Addressing the medication contraindication is the priority.",

The client's platelet count of 45,000/mm³ is a critical finding and an absolute contraindication to administering a thrombolytic agent. Alteplase promotes fibrinolysis, breaking down existing clots. With a severely reduced platelet count, the client lacks the necessary components for clot formation to stop any bleeding that may occur. Proceeding would place the client at an unacceptably high risk for fatal hemorrhage. This violates the core principle of 'do no harm.'"

Recognizing the absolute contraindication of severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000/mm³) and halting the administration process is the nurse's primary responsibility to prevent patient harm. Immediate communication with the provider is essential to discuss alternative treatment strategies, such as holding the alteplase and considering alternative interventions or platelet transfusion.

The priority is to address the factor that completely prohibits the planned treatment due to the high risk of hemorrhage.

This action does not address the critical medication safety issue at hand and is therefore not the priority. The nurse must first prevent the iatrogenic harm of administering a contraindicated drug. Implementing seizure precautions without addressing the immediate risk of hemorrhage from alteplase administration is a misprioritization of care."
