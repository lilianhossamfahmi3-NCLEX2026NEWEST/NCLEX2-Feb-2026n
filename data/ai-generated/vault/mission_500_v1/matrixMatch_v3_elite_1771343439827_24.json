    "correct": "The client's presentation, triggered by the inability to take their prescribed hydrocortisone (a social determinant of health), indicates a potential adrenal (Addisonian) crisis. This is a life-threatening state of acute adrenal insufficiency characterized by profound hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The nurse must recognize the signs indicating hypovolemic and distributive shock (BP 82/48 mmHg, HR 128/min) and the immediately life-threatening cardiac risk posed by severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.9 mEq/L), which is confirmed by the classic ECG finding of tall, peaked T waves. The most critical 'safety stop' action is to withhold the scheduled spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, as administering it would worsen the hyperkalemia and could precipitate a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Immediate interventions include administering IV fluids and hydrocortisone as prescribed, monitoring cardiac rhythm, and notifying the provider.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindication for spironolactone is the most significant error. Administering this medication in the setting of severe hyperkalemia constitutes a critical safety threat. Additionally, viewing any of the vital sign or lab abnormalities as 'safe to proceed' without intervention ignores the signs of impending cardiovascular collapse. While the hydrocortisone and IV fluids are crucial interventions, the spironolactone must be withheld.",
