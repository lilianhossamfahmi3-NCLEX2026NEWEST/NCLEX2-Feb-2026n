    "correct": "The priority is patient safety. The client presents with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causing obstructive shock, indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. While alteplase is indicated to dissolve the PE, the client has critical contraindications: recent head trauma (syncopal episode with head strike) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 75,000/mm³). Alteplase, a thrombolytic, increases the risk of bleeding. Head trauma increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and thrombocytopenia impairs the body's ability to clot, further elevating ICH risk. Administering alteplase could lead to catastrophic ICH and death. The nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider to discuss alternative treatment options, such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis, which may be safer in this context.",
