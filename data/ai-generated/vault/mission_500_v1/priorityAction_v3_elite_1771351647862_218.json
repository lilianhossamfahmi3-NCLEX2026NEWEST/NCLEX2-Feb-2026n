Administering alteplase, a potent fibrinolytic, in this context creates an extremely high risk of fatal intracranial hemorrhage. The nurse's priority is to recognize this 'SAFETY STOP' moment, withhold the medication, and immediately communicate these critical findings to the provider to prevent catastrophic patient harm.",

While the client is in obstructive shock from the PE, which is an indication for alteplase, this action ignores the critical contraindications present. Proceeding with administration demonstrates a failure to perform a final safety check and could lead to a fatal intracranial bleed. The risk of harm from the medication now outweighs its potential benefit."

The nurse cannot order diagnostic imaging. The priority is to first halt the dangerous medication order and communicate with the provider, who will then likely order the head CT. The nurse's scope of practice dictates withholding a medication and notifying, not ordering further tests."
