    "correct": "The client exhibits Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS), marked by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, and dehydration, without significant ketoacidosis. The critical finding is hypokalemia (K+ 2.8 mEq/L) and ECG changes (ST depression, U waves). Insulin administration is contraindicated due to the risk of further potassium shift into cells, potentially causing fatal arrhythmias. Priorities include aggressive fluid resuscitation and potassium replacement *before* insulin. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect arrhythmias. \n\n**SBAR:** 78-year-old male with T2DM and HTN, lethargic and confused for 3 days. Glucose 980 mg/dL, Na 152 mEq/L, K 2.8 mEq/L, BUN 88 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.9 mg/dL, Osmolality 365 mOsm/kg, BP 94/58 mmHg, HR 128 bpm. Client requires immediate fluid resuscitation and potassium replacement. Contraindicated to administer insulin at this time. Monitor cardiac rhythm closely.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting 'Essential' for insulin administration is a critical error, failing to recognize the danger of hypokalemia with insulin therapy. Selecting 'Contraindicated' for fluid or potassium replacement misunderstands HHS pathophysiology and immediate interventions. Classifying cardiac monitoring or urinary catheter insertion as 'Non-essential' overlooks the need for close cardiovascular and fluid balance monitoring.",

Insulin promotes potassium uptake into cells, exacerbating hypokalemia and potentially causing fatal arrhythmias. Insulin should be held until potassium is at least 3.3 mEq/L. *Clinical Pearl: Always check potassium levels before initiating insulin therapy in hyperglycemic patients.*"

Fluid resuscitation is the priority to restore intravascular volume, improve organ perfusion, and gradually lower serum glucose. *Pathophysiology: Hyperglycemia causes osmotic diuresis, leading to dehydration and electrolyte loss.*"
