This is a state of severe end-organ hypoperfusion due to primary cardiac pump failure. The most critical safety issue is the severe hypokalemia (2.6 mEq/L). The STAT order for furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, MUST be withheld ('Don't Proceed'). Administering furosemide would cause further potassium wasting, likely precipitating a fatal cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes) in an already ischemic and unstable myocardium. The nurse's independent priority actions are to withhold the dangerous medication and immediately notify the provider of the life-threatening lab value to facilitate a change in the plan of care (e.g., potassium replacement before diuresis). Monitoring MAP and urine output are the most direct ways to assess the adequacy of systemic perfusion and the effectiveness of shock interventions.",
