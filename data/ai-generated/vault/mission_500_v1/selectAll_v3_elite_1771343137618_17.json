Client states they 'ran out of insulin 3 days ago and couldn't afford the refill.' An 18-gauge IV has been established in the left antecubital fossa. A 1 L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride was initiated 30 minutes ago and is infusing."

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. The underlying pathophysiology involves an absolute or relative insulin deficiency, leading to unrestrained hepatic glucose production and impaired glucose utilization by peripheral tissues. This results in hyperglycemia, which exceeds the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, causing osmotic diuresis and dehydration. The body then breaks down fatty acids for energy, producing ketone bodies, leading to metabolic acidosis. The client's lab results confirm DKA: elevated glucose (680 mg/dL), low bicarbonate (10 mEq/L), low pH (7.18), positive serum ketones, and an elevated anion gap (24). The ECG findings (flattened T-waves, U-waves) are indicative of hypokalemia. The most critical safety risk is initiating the insulin infusion due to the client's severe hypokalemia (K+ 2.8 mEq/L). Insulin promotes the intracellular movement of potassium. Administering insulin in this state will further deplete serum potassium, potentially causing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and ultimately cardiac arrest. Therefore, the priority nursing actions are to (B) withhold the insulin infusion, (D) place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring to detect and manage potential arrhythmias, and (E) immediately notify the healthcare provider of the critical potassium level to obtain orders for potassium replacement. Potassium levels must be corrected to a safe range (typically >3.3 mEq/L) before initiating insulin therapy.",
