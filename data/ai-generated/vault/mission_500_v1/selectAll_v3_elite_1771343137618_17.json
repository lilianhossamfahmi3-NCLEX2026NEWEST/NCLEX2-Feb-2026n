Client is lethargic but arousable to verbal stimuli. Skin is warm, dry, with poor turgor. Respirations are deep and rapid with a fruity odor noted on breath. Client states they 'ran out of insulin 3 days ago and couldn't afford the refill.' An 18-gauge IV has been established in the left antecubital fossa. A 1 L bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride was initiated 30 minutes ago and is infusing."

The most critical safety risk is starting the insulin infusion. Insulin drives potassium from the extracellular fluid into cells, which will rapidly worsen the existing hypokalemia and can precipitate fatal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) and cardiac arrest. Therefore, the nurse's priority actions are to (B) withhold the insulin, (D) place the client on a cardiac monitor to observe for life-threatening arrhythmias, and (E) immediately notify the provider of the critical potassium level to obtain orders for potassium replacement. Potassium must be corrected to a safe level (typically > 3.3 mEq/L) before insulin therapy can be safely initiated.",
