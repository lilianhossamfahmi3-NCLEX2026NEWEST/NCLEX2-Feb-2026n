However, the nurse must continually reassess the client's response. In this case, the client is developing signs of fluid volume overload and acute kidney injury (AKI). The new bilateral crackles indicate fluid is accumulating in the alveoli (pulmonary edema), which will impair gas exchange. The severely low urine output (oliguria, <0.5 mL/kg/hr) combined with a high creatinine level confirms AKI; the kidneys cannot excrete the administered fluid. Administering another large fluid bolus would be life-threatening, leading to worsening pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and potentially ARDS. These findings are critical contraindications ('SAFETY STOP'). The nurse's independent action is to withhold the fluid and immediately notify the provider to discuss switching from fluid resuscitation to primarily vasopressor support and potential renal replacement therapy.",
