The combination of hyperkalemia, renal failure, bradycardia, a prolonged PR interval, and a high-therapeutic digoxin level creates a 'perfect storm' where IV calcium can potentiate digoxin's effect on the myocardium, leading to fatal dysrhythmias such as complete heart block or ventricular tachycardia. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment where the nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider.",

Proceeding with standard hyperkalemia protocol without synthesizing all data points (MAR, Labs, ECG, Vitals) demonstrates a failure in clinical judgment and risk identification. Similarly, administering another dose of digoxin would worsen the existing toxicity. The other actions (insulin/dextrose, SPS, dialysis) are appropriate and necessary components of care.",
