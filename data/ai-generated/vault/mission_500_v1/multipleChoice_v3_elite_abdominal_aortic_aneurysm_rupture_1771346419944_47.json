    "correct": "opt_04",
    "rationales": {
      "opt_01": "Rationale: While administering blood products is crucial for addressing the hemorrhagic shock resulting from a ruptured AAA, it is not the *immediate* priority. The administration of an anticoagulant in the setting of active, massive hemorrhage would exacerbate the patient's condition. The nurse must first address the medication error before proceeding with other supportive measures.",
      "opt_02": "Rationale: Initiating vasopressors like norepinephrine is important to support blood pressure in decompensated shock. However, administering an anticoagulant would counteract any benefit from vasopressors and transfusions by accelerating blood loss. The medication error must be stopped before other supportive care is given.",
      "opt_03": "Rationale: This action is incorrect and potentially lethal. The patient is experiencing a massive hemorrhage evidenced by vital sign trends, lab results (low Hgb, low platelets), and ultrasound findings. Administering enoxaparin, an anticoagulant, is an absolute contraindication and would accelerate the bleeding, leading to irreversible shock and death. In a ruptured AAA, the tunica media and adventitia layers of the aorta are disrupted, leading to uncontrolled bleeding into the retroperitoneal space. Enoxaparin inhibits clotting factors Xa and IIa (thrombin), further preventing the body's natural ability to form clots and stop the hemorrhage.",
      "opt_04": "Rationale: Correct. The nurse's highest priority is to recognize and prevent a life-threatening medication error. The combination of clinical cues (hypotension, tachycardia, ripping pain, pulsatile mass, low Hgb, thrombocytopenia, positive FAST scan) confirms active, massive hemorrhage. Administering an anticoagulant (enoxaparin) in this setting is a catastrophic error. The nurse must apply 'safety stop' logic, withhold the medication, and immediately contact the provider for clarification. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm and is the most critical nursing intervention. The pathophysiology of a ruptured AAA involves a weakening of the aortic wall, often due to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and genetic factors. This weakening leads to a progressive dilation of the aorta, eventually resulting in rupture. The rupture causes massive blood loss, leading to hypovolemic shock and potential death. The body's compensatory mechanisms, such as increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, are overwhelmed, leading to organ ischemia and failure."

    "recommendation": "Question the order for enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous STAT due to active hemorrhage from suspected ruptured AAA.
