Proceeding with transfusion without addressing the anticoagulant order would be unsafe.",
            "opt_02": "Rationale: Initiating vasopressors like norepinephrine is appropriate to support blood pressure in decompensated shock. However, the nurse's primary responsibility is to first 'do no harm'. Administering an anticoagulant would counteract any benefit from vasopressors and transfusions by accelerating blood loss. The medication error must be stopped before other supportive care is given.",
            "opt_03": "Rationale: This action is incorrect and potentially lethal. The patient is experiencing a massive hemorrhage evidenced by vital sign trends, lab results (low Hgb, low platelets), and ultrasound findings. Administering enoxaparin, an anticoagulant, is an absolute contraindication and would accelerate the bleeding, leading to irreversible shock and death.",
            "opt_04": "Rationale: Correct. The nurse's highest priority is to recognize and prevent a life-threatening medication error. The combination of clinical cues (hypotension, tachycardia, ripping pain, pulsatile mass, low Hgb, thrombocytopenia, positive FAST scan) confirms active, massive hemorrhage. Administering an anticoagulant (enoxaparin) in this setting is a catastrophic error. The nurse must apply 'safety stop' logic, withhold the medication, and immediately contact the provider for clarification. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm and is the most critical nursing intervention."
