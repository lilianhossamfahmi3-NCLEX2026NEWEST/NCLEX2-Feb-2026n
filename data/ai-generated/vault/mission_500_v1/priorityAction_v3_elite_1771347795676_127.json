        "correct": "The client is in decompensating cardiogenic shock. This is evidenced by the progressive decline in blood pressure and MAP (now 60 mmHg), increasing tachycardia and tachypnea, worsening hypoxia, cool/clammy skin, and elevated lactate (5.2 mmol/L), indicating severe tissue hypoperfusion. Although the client has clinical signs of fluid overload (crackles, edema), administering a potent loop diuretic like furosemide to a client with a MAP of 60 would cause a sudden drop in preload, leading to catastrophic hypotension and potential cardiovascular collapse. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment. The nurse must recognize this life-threatening contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately communicate the client's deteriorating hemodynamic status to the provider for a change in the plan of care, which may include increasing vasopressor support or considering mechanical circulatory support.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to withhold the furosemide represents a critical safety error that could lead to a life-threatening event. The other actions, while potentially beneficial, do not address the most immediate iatrogenic danger posed by the scheduled medication in the context of the client's worsening shock state.",

                "justification": "This is incorrect and extremely dangerous. While furosemide treats fluid overload, its primary effect is profound diuresis which rapidly reduces preload. In a patient with a failing cardiac pump and a MAP of 60, this will precipitate severe hypotension and worsen end-organ perfusion, potentially leading to cardiac arrest."

The most immediate threat is the potential administration of a contraindicated medication (furosemide). The nurse must first prevent harm (withhold the diuretic) before intervening to correct the hypotension. The provider must be notified of the overall clinical picture of decompensation."
