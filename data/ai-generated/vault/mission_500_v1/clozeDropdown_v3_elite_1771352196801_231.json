    "correct": "The nurse must analyze all available data before administering a high-risk medication like alteplase. The client's platelet count is 72,000/μL, which is significantly below the minimum threshold of 100,000/μL required for safe administration of tPA. This condition, thrombocytopenia, is an absolute contraindication. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that works by dissolving blood clots. Platelets are essential for blood clot formation and hemostasis. In thrombocytopenia, the body's ability to form clots is already compromised. Administering alteplase further impairs clot formation, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly in the brain. Proceeding with administration would place the client at an extremely high and unacceptable risk for life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage (hemorrhagic conversion). The nurse's primary independent action is to recognize this 'safety stop' condition, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider of the contraindication.",
    "incorrect": "The other options represent a failure to recognize a critical contraindication, leading to a potentially fatal medication error. While the client meets several criteria for tPA (ischemic stroke confirmed by CT, within time window, NIHSS >5, controlled BP), the single critical lab value of thrombocytopenia overrides all other indications. The nurse must act as the final safety barrier.",

        "justification": "This is the correct and only safe action. A platelet count less than 100,000/μL is an absolute contraindication for alteplase therapy due to the high risk of severe bleeding. The nurse's priority is to prevent harm by withholding the medication and communicating the critical finding to the provider. The nurse must immediately communicate the critical lab value to the provider to discuss alternative treatment options for the client's acute ischemic stroke. This demonstrates effective interprofessional collaboration and ensures the client receives appropriate care without risking harm."

The vital signs trend shows that the initial dose of labetalol successfully lowered the blood pressure to 170/94 mmHg, which is within the acceptable range (<185/110 mmHg) for tPA administration. The BP is not the current safety issue. Focusing on blood pressure management while ignoring the critical thrombocytopenia delays appropriate action and puts the client at risk."

The immediate priority is to address the safety of the pending medication order. The decision for thrombectomy is made by the provider/stroke team, and the nurse's critical role here is preventing a medication error. Initiating preparations for a thrombectomy without addressing the contraindication to alteplase could delay necessary interventions and expose the client to unnecessary risks."

        "content": "hemorrhagic conversion due to thrombocytopenia",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This correctly identifies the pathophysiology of the risk. Alteplase dissolves fibrin clots, and platelets are essential for forming new clots to stop bleeding. With a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), the client's ability to achieve hemostasis is already impaired, and giving a fibrinolytic agent would create a severe, uncontrolled bleeding risk, specifically a hemorrhagic conversion of the ischemic stroke. The reduced platelet count impairs the body's ability to form stable clots, making the client highly vulnerable to bleeding within the brain tissue, which can lead to irreversible neurological damage or death."

Uncontrolled hypertension is no longer the primary risk. While hypertension is a risk factor for stroke and needs to be managed, it is not the immediate threat in this scenario due to the effectiveness of the antihypertensive medication."

This is well within the standard 3 to 4.5-hour window for alteplase administration. The time window is not the contraindication. The client is within the therapeutic window for alteplase, but the presence of thrombocytopenia overrides the time-sensitive nature of the treatment."

The most critical, data-driven risk is bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Anaphylaxis is a potential risk with any medication, but the presence of thrombocytopenia presents a more immediate and life-threatening risk in this situation."
