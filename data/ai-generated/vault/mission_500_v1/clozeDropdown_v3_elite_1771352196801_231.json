The client's platelet count is 72,000/μL, which is significantly below the minimum threshold of 100,000/μL required for safe administration of tPA. This condition, thrombocytopenia, is an absolute contraindication. Proceeding with administration would place the client at an extremely high and unacceptable risk for life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage (hemorrhagic conversion). The nurse's primary independent action is to recognize this 'safety stop' condition, withhold the medication, and immediately notify the provider of the contraindication.",

While the client meets several criteria for tPA (ischemic stroke confirmed by CT, within time window, NIHSS >5, controlled BP), the single critical lab value of thrombocytopenia overrides all other indications. The nurse must act as the final safety barrier.",
