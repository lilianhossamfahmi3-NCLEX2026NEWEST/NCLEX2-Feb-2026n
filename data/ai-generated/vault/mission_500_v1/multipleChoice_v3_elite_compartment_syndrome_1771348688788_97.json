Client reports excruciating, burning pain rated 10/10, describing it as 'my arm is going to explode.' Pain is unrelieved by one dose of IV morphine. Right forearm is markedly edematous, tense, and cool to the touch from wrist to elbow. Two small puncture wounds are noted with surrounding ecchymosis and multiple hemorrhagic bullae. Client reports tingling and 'pins and needles' in his right hand. Right radial pulse is weak and difficult to palpate; detected via Doppler."

        "correctRationale": "The client's clinical presentation (tense, swollen arm; extreme pain; paresthesia; weak pulse) is classic for acute compartment syndrome. The laboratory results reveal a life-threatening venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (INR 2.9, Fibrinogen 80 mg/dL). Administering an intramuscular (IM) injection is absolutely contraindicated in a client with severe coagulopathy, as it poses a high risk of causing an uncontrollable intramuscular hematoma, which would worsen the compartment syndrome and lead to further tissue damage and blood loss. The nurse's first and most critical action is to recognize this safety risk and withhold the harmful intervention, then immediately communicate the critical lab findings to the provider. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' safety stop.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is developing shock (hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate) and requires fluid resuscitation, the most immediate priority is to prevent iatrogenic harm. The IV bolus is a necessary intervention, but it does not take precedence over stopping a contraindicated and potentially catastrophic action (the IM injection). The bolus can be initiated immediately after addressing the safety issue."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. An emergency fasciotomy is the definitive treatment for compartment syndrome and is urgently needed. However, preparing for this procedure is a collaborative action that requires a surgeon and operating room team. The nurse's highest priority independent action is to prevent immediate harm and stabilize the patient. Notifying the provider about the coagulopathy (the rationale for the correct answer) is a prerequisite to safely proceeding to surgery."

                "optionIndex": 3,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's pain is ischemic pain caused by nerve compression and tissue hypoxia from compartment syndrome. It will not respond to opioids. Administering more morphine to a client who is already hypotensive (BP 92/54) and tachycardic is dangerous as it can cause further vasodilation and worsen hemodynamic instability. The priority is to address the underlying cause of the pain, not to medicate a symptom with a potentially harmful agent."
