Client reports excruciating, burning pain rated 10/10, describing it as 'my arm is going to explode.' Pain is unrelieved by one dose of IV morphine. Right forearm is markedly edematous, tense, and cool to the touch from wrist to elbow. Two small puncture wounds are noted with surrounding ecchymosis and multiple hemorrhagic bullae. Client reports tingling and 'pins and needles' in his right hand. Right radial pulse is weak and difficult to palpate; detected via Doppler."

    "correctRationale": "The client presents with signs of envenomation-induced consumptive coagulopathy (elevated INR, decreased fibrinogen) and acute compartment syndrome (severe pain, edema, paresthesia, weak pulse). Intramuscular (IM) injections are contraindicated in clients with coagulopathies due to the high risk of uncontrollable hematoma formation, which would exacerbate compartment syndrome and lead to further tissue damage and blood loss. The priority is to withhold the IM injection and immediately notify the provider of the critical lab findings. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' safety stop. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Rattlesnake venom contains enzymes that disrupt the coagulation cascade, leading to consumptive coagulopathy. This means the body's clotting factors are being used up faster than they can be produced, resulting in an increased risk of bleeding. Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure within a muscle compartment increases, restricting blood flow and potentially causing irreversible tissue damage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess coagulation status before administering IM injections, especially in patients with potential bleeding risks.",
