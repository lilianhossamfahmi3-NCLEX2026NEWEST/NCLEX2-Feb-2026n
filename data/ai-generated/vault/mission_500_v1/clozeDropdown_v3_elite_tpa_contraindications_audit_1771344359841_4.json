    "rationale": "The core of this question is identifying an absolute contraindication to alteplase (tPA) therapy that requires the nurse to stop the process and intervene. The patient's spouse reported, and the MAR confirms, a home medication of Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor. The spouse stated the client took a dose 'this morning'. Use of direct thrombin inhibitors or direct factor Xa inhibitors (like rivaroxaban) within 48 hours is an absolute contraindication for tPA due to the profound and unpredictable increase in the risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa in the coagulation cascade, preventing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which is essential for clot formation. By inhibiting this process, rivaroxaban increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain, if tPA is administered. Even though the head CT is clear and the blood pressure has been controlled, this medication history makes administering tPA unsafe. The nurse's primary responsibility is to act as a patient safety advocate, recognize this critical contraindication, and immediately contact the provider to question and withhold the order.",
