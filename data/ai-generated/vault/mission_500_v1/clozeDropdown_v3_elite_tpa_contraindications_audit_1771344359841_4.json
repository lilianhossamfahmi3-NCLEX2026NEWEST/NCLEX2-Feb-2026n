The patient's spouse reported, and the MAR confirms, a home medication of Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor. The spouse stated the client took a dose 'this morning'. Use of direct thrombin inhibitors or direct factor Xa inhibitors (like rivaroxaban) within 48 hours is an absolute contraindication for tPA due to the profound and unpredictable increase in the risk of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Even though the head CT is clear and the blood pressure has been controlled, this medication history makes administering tPA unsafe. The nurse's primary responsibility is to act as a patient safety advocate, recognize this critical contraindication, and immediately contact the provider to question and withhold the order.",
