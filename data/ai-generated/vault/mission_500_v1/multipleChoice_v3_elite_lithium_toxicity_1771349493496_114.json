The clinical presentation, including confusion, ataxia, slurred speech, coarse tremors, hypotension, tachycardia, ECG changes, and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Creatinine), all indicate severe lithium toxicity. Administering more lithium would worsen the toxicity and could lead to seizures, coma, or death."

The nurse must recognize the constellation of cues pointing to severe lithium toxicity: a toxic serum level (2.1 mEq/L), neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia), renal impairment (BUN 45, Creatinine 2.2), and cardiotoxicity (prolonged QTc). The addition of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, likely precipitated this by reducing renal clearance of lithium. Withholding the medication is the critical first step to prevent further harm. Immediate notification of the provider is necessary to initiate emergency interventions such as aggressive hydration and possible hemodialysis."

While the client has significant neurological symptoms, the data strongly suggests they are a direct result of lithium toxicity, not a new primary neurological disorder. The most immediate priority is to address the cause of the symptoms by stopping the offending medication. Delaying this action to request a consult could lead to irreversible neurological damage. The consult may be appropriate later, but it is not the initial priority action."

Although the client is hypotensive and fluid resuscitation is a key component of treating lithium toxicity, the absolute first priority is to stop the administration of the toxin. Administering fluids without withholding the lithium dose is an incomplete and potentially dangerous action. The nurse's most appropriate independent action is to first 'stop the poison' by withholding the medication."
