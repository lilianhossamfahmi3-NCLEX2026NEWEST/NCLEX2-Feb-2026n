Admitted for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Currently 12 hours post-operative from emergent right-sided craniotomy for hematoma evacuation. External ventricular drain (EVD) in place, draining clear cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n**0800:** Drowsy but arousable to verbal stimuli. Oriented to person and place. Follows simple commands. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light (PERRL). Moves all extremities spontaneously.\n\n**0900:** More lethargic. Arouses to loud voice but quickly drifts back to sleep. Able to follow commands but responses are delayed. \n\n**1000:** Difficult to arouse. Responds only to trapezial pinch by localizing with left arm. Right pupil is 4mm and sluggishly reactive; left pupil is 3mm and briskly reactive."

Additionally, the client exhibits a declining level of consciousness (drowsy to difficult to arouse) and pupillary changes (right pupil 4mm and sluggishly reactive, left pupil 3mm and briskly reactive). These findings, in the context of a recent craniotomy and known cerebral edema, strongly suggest a life-threatening increase in ICP and potential for brain herniation.
