The client's platelet count is 85,000/mm³, which is an absolute contraindication for thrombolytic therapy. The threshold is a platelet count >100,000/mm³. Administering alteplase with significant thrombocytopenia places the client at an extremely high risk for life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The nurse's role as the final safety check before medication administration is critical in preventing this catastrophic outcome.",

The blood pressure, while on the high side of the acceptable range, is currently at 184/108 mmHg, which is below the <185/110 mmHg threshold required for tPA administration; therefore, another dose of labetalol is not the priority action. While the glucose is elevated, it is not high enough to be an absolute contraindication, and managing it is a secondary priority to the life-threatening contraindication of thrombocytopenia.",

While vigilant blood pressure management is crucial, the client's current BP of 184/108 mmHg is just below the required threshold of <185/110 mmHg. The immediate, life-threatening contraindication is the low platelet count, which must be addressed first. This action fails to recognize the most critical safety issue."

The nurse has identified an absolute contraindication (platelet count <100,000/mm³) that was potentially missed by the team. The nurse's primary responsibility is to act as a patient advocate and safety barrier.

Treatment is typically considered for glucose >180-200 mg/dL. This finding does not represent an immediate contraindication to tPA and is a much lower priority than the critical thrombocytopenia."
