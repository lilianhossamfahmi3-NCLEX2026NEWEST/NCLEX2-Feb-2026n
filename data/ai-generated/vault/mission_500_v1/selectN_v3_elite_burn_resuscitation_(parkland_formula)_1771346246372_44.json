    "itemRationale": "This question assesses the nurse's ability to recognize a critical, life-threatening complication of burn resuscitation and take immediate action. The client has severe electrical burns, causing rhabdomyolysis and massive potassium release from damaged cells. This is compounded by pre-existing CKD and developing AKI (evidenced by rising BUN/Cr and oliguria), preventing potassium excretion. The client is now severely hyperkalemic. The current intervention, infusion of Lactated Ringer's (which contains potassium), is fueling this life-threatening electrolyte imbalance and must be stopped immediately. The nurse must identify the cluster of cues indicating hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity (high K+ lab, ECG changes, paradoxical bradycardia) and renal failure (oliguria) to prevent cardiac arrest.\n\n**SBAR Communication Example (to physician at 1600):**\n\n*   **Situation:** 48-year-old male, post electrical burn, fluid resuscitated with LR since 1200. Now lethargic.\n*   **Background:** 40.5% TBSA burn, CKD Stage 2. Fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula. Initial response was adequate, but now showing signs of deterioration.\n*   **Assessment:** Current BP 88/54, HR 68, UO 20 mL/hr. K+ 7.2 mEq/L. ECG shows sinus bradycardia with peaked T waves and widened QRS. BUN/Cr increasing. \n*   **Recommendation:** I am concerned about severe hyperkalemia and possible cardiac arrest. I recommend stopping the Lactated Ringer's immediately and initiating treatment for hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, kayexalate). Would you like any further information or have any other orders at this time?\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Electrical burns frequently cause deep tissue damage and rhabdomyolysis, leading to hyperkalemia. Pre-existing renal conditions exacerbate this risk. Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent electrolyte checks are crucial during resuscitation.",

        "rationale": "Correct. A serum potassium of 7.2 mEq/L is a critical, life-threatening value. It directly indicates severe hyperkalemia, which requires immediate intervention to prevent fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. This finding is a primary reason to stop the potassium-containing Lactated Ringer's infusion. **Pathophysiology:** Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable initially, but eventually leading to decreased excitability and impaired repolarization. This manifests as peaked T waves, widened QRS, and ultimately, cardiac arrest.",

        "optionIndex": 1,
        "rationale": "Correct. The ECG findings of peaked T-waves and widened QRS complexes are classic signs of hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity. This is a medical emergency indicating that the elevated potassium is having a dangerous effect on the heart's electrical conduction system, placing the client at imminent risk for cardiac arrest. **Pathophysiology:** Elevated extracellular potassium alters the normal potassium gradient across cardiac cell membranes. This affects the rate of repolarization, leading to the characteristic ECG changes. The widened QRS indicates slowed intraventricular conduction.",

      {
        "optionIndex": 2,
        "rationale": "Correct. For a 90 kg client, adequate urine output during burn resuscitation is typically targeted at 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr (45-90 mL/hr). An output of 20 mL/hr constitutes significant oliguria. This, along with rising BUN/Cr, signals acute kidney injury (AKI). The failing kidneys cannot excrete potassium, which is a major contributor to the severe hyperkalemia. **Pathophysiology:** Burn injuries can cause hypovolemia and decreased renal perfusion, leading to AKI. Rhabdomyolysis, common in electrical burns, releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can further damage the kidneys. Impaired renal function reduces potassium excretion, exacerbating hyperkalemia.",

      {
        "optionIndex": 3,
        "rationale": "Correct. A client in distributive (burn) shock should be tachycardic to compensate for hypovolemia. The heart rate dropping from 125/min to 68/min despite persistent hypotension is a paradoxical and ominous sign. This bradycardia is likely caused by the severe hyperkalemia's effect on cardiac muscle and signals impending cardiovascular collapse. **Pathophysiology:** Hyperkalemia initially increases myocardial excitability, but as potassium levels rise, it depresses conduction and contractility. This can lead to bradycardia, heart blocks, and ultimately, asystole.",
