The trend data shows worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, severe hypoxia (SpO2 87%), and respiratory acidosis (pCO2 70 mmHg), indicating decompensation. The highest priorities are to escalate care for a definitive airway, prepare for that intervention, and avoid any action that could precipitate complete airway closure. Notifying the RRT/anesthesiology (the experts in airway management), gathering emergency equipment, and keeping the child calm and in a position of comfort are the only safe and appropriate immediate actions.",

This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' action. Visualizing the throat is absolutely contraindicated as it can induce laryngospasm and immediate airway closure. Increasing blow-by oxygen is insufficient for the degree of obstruction and hypoxia; it provides a false sense of security while delaying definitive airway management. While oxygen is not harmful, it is not a priority action over securing the airway team.",
