Insulin drives potassium from the extracellular space into the cells, which will rapidly worsen the existing hypokalemia. This can precipitate fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, especially given the ECG already shows signs of hypokalemia (flattened T-waves, prominent U waves). Therefore, the nurse's priority is to 'STOP' and prevent harm. The correct actions are to withhold the insulin, communicate the critical finding to the provider (advocating for potassium replacement before insulin is started), and implement immediate safety monitoring (cardiac monitor) due to the high risk of arrhythmias.",

Changing the IV fluid to hypotonic saline (0.45% NaCl) is incorrect for initial resuscitation as it can lower serum osmolality too quickly, increasing the risk for cerebral edema. Inserting a urinary catheter, while useful for monitoring, is not as immediately life-preserving as addressing the critical electrolyte imbalance.",

Insulin causes an intracellular shift of potassium, which would exacerbate the hypokalemia and likely lead to severe cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. It is an absolute contraindication to start an insulin drip with a K+ < 3.3 mEq/L."

The initial fluid for resuscitation in HHS is isotonic (0.9% sodium chloride) to expand intravascular volume and stabilize hemodynamics.
