        "correct": "The client is in an adrenal crisis, characterized by hypovolemic shock, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and life-threatening hyperkalemia. The most immediate threat to life is the serum potassium of 6.2 mEq/L, which is causing cardiotoxicity as evidenced by the tall, peaked T-waves on the ECG. This finding indicates a high risk for developing lethal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, asystole). Calcium gluconate works almost immediately to stabilize the cardiac membrane, antagonizing the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart muscle. This action is a critical 'safety stop' to prevent imminent cardiac arrest. While other interventions are necessary, none are as immediately life-saving as protecting the heart.",

Prioritizing fluid resuscitation or steroid replacement over immediate cardiac protection in the face of hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity would be a critical safety error. Delaying care by questioning the lab value is also unsafe given the confirmatory ECG findings.",

While hydrocortisone is the definitive treatment to reverse the underlying adrenal insufficiency, its effects on correcting electrolyte imbalances and hemodynamics are not immediate. It will not rapidly protect the heart from the severe hyperkalemia. The risk of cardiac arrest from the K+ of 6.2 is more immediate than the need for steroid replacement."

                "justification": "This is incorrect. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with D5NS is critical to treat the hypovolemic shock and hypoglycemia. However, it will not correct the hyperkalemia quickly and, most importantly, does not offer the immediate cardioprotective effect needed to prevent a fatal dysrhythmia. Stabilizing the heart muscle is the top priority."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "justification": "This is the correct priority action. The combination of severe hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L) and ECG changes (peaked T-waves) signifies extreme cardiac membrane instability and a high risk of imminent cardiac arrest. Calcium gluconate directly antagonizes the cardiotoxic effects of potassium, stabilizing the myocardium within minutes. This is a life-saving 'safety stop' that must precede all other interventions."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "justification": "This is incorrect as the first action. Insulin (with dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia) is a primary treatment to lower serum potassium by shifting it into the cells. However, its onset of action is 15-30 minutes. When ECG changes are present, calcium gluconate must be given first because its cardioprotective effect is nearly instantaneous. Insulin is the second step in managing the hyperkalemia after the heart has been stabilized."

                "justification": "This is incorrect and a dangerous delay of care. While lab errors can occur (e.g., hemolysis causing pseudohyperkalemia), the client's clinical presentation (adrenal crisis) and the classic ECG findings (peaked T-waves) strongly corroborate the high potassium level. Assuming a lab error in this context would waste critical time and place the client at risk for cardiac arrest."
