    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of acute lithium toxicity. The elevated serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L is significantly above the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). The client's recent use of ibuprofen, an NSAID, likely contributed to this toxicity by reducing renal blood flow and prostaglandin synthesis, leading to decreased lithium clearance and subsequent accumulation. This is further supported by the elevated BUN (35 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.9 mg/dL), indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The client's reported symptoms of lethargy, coarse tremors, nausea, and diarrhea are classic manifestations of lithium-induced neurotoxicity. The hyponatremia (132 mEq/L) can exacerbate lithium toxicity, as the kidneys compensate by increasing lithium reabsorption. The vital signs reveal progressive bradycardia (HR 54 bpm) and hypotension (BP 98/58), and the ECG findings of flattened T-waves and prominent U waves are suggestive of electrolyte imbalances associated with lithium toxicity. The priority nursing action is to withhold the scheduled 0800 dose of lithium to prevent further accumulation and worsening of the toxicity. The provider must be notified immediately to facilitate further management, which may include intravenous hydration and/or hemodialysis to remove the excess lithium.",
