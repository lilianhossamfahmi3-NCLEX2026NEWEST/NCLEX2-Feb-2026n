Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. Additionally, lisinopril is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable clients with AKI due to the risk of further reducing renal perfusion.

      "Situation": "The nurse is preparing to administer medications to a 48-year-old male client at 0900 (09:00). The client has a history of alcohol use disorder and is currently experiencing homelessness. He was brought to the emergency department after being found on a sidewalk.",
      "Background": "The client is drowsy, oriented to person and place, with a GCS of 14. He complains of severe muscle pain, especially in the thighs and lower back. His skin is cool and clammy. An indwelling urinary catheter is in place, draining scant, dark brown urine. Vital signs show hypotension (94/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (126 bpm). Laboratory results indicate hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L), hyponatremia (132 mEq/L), elevated BUN (92 mg/dL) and creatinine (5.4 mg/dL), significantly elevated creatine kinase (65,200 U/L), mildly elevated troponin (0.09 ng/mL), and elevated lactate (3.2 mmol/L). ECG shows sinus tachycardia with peaked T-waves and widened QRS.",
      "Assessment": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to prolonged immobilization and possible dehydration. The most critical finding is severe hyperkalemia with evidence of cardiotoxicity, indicated by peaked T-waves and widened QRS complex on the ECG.",
      "Recommendation": "The nurse should immediately administer calcium gluconate 1 gram IV STAT over 5 minutes to stabilize the cardiac membrane. Hold the scheduled doses of spironolactone 25 mg PO and lisinopril 10 mg PO at 0900 (09:00). Continuously monitor vital signs, ECG, and laboratory values, particularly potassium levels. Anticipate further interventions, such as fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride and management of AKI, as directed by the provider. Prepare for possible dialysis if hyperkalemia is refractory to medical management."
