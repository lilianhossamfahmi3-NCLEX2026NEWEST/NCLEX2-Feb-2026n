This refractory hypotension is a hallmark of distributive shock seen in adrenal crisis, where there is a lack of cortisol to potentiate the effects of catecholamines on blood vessels.",
            "opt_1b": "Correct. The serum potassium of 6.8 mEq/L is critically high (hyperkalemia). This is a direct result of aldosterone deficiency in adrenal crisis and poses an immediate, life-threatening risk of cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest.",
            "opt_1c": "Correct. The history of chronic steroid (prednisone) use for SLE followed by abrupt cessation 5 days ago is the precipitating event. This action caused iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, leading to the current crisis. This is the root cause of the entire clinical picture.",
            "opt_1d": "Correct. The lactate level of 4.2 mmol/L is significantly elevated, indicating tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. It confirms the presence of a severe shock state, requiring immediate intervention.",
            "opt_1e": "Correct. The ECG finding of tall, peaked T-waves is a classic and ominous sign of hyperkalemia's cardiotoxic effects. It signals impending, life-threatening arrhythmias and must be addressed urgently.",
            "opt_1f": "Incorrect. The white blood cell count is within the normal range (9,500/mm³). This finding makes infectious sepsis less likely as the primary cause of shock and strongly points towards a non-infectious etiology, such as the adrenal crisis suggested by the other data points."

            "opt_2a": "Incorrect. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment. While norepinephrine is a vasopressor used for hypotension, it will be ineffective in adrenal crisis without cortisol. Cortisol has a permissive effect on catecholamines, meaning it is required for vasopressors to work properly. Administering norepinephrine without first giving corticosteroids is futile, delays definitive treatment, and can lead to cardiovascular collapse.",
            "opt_2b": "Correct. This is the highest priority action. The client's presentation is classic for adrenal crisis. The definitive treatment is immediate replacement of glucocorticoids. Intravenous hydrocortisone will restore vascular tone, improve blood pressure, and reverse the metabolic abnormalities. The nurse must recognize the missing order and advocate for it immediately.",
            "opt_2c": "Correct. The potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L with associated ECG changes constitutes a medical emergency. Administering IV insulin and dextrose is a critical, rapid intervention to temporarily shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, thus lowering the serum potassium level and protecting the heart from life-threatening arrhythmias while the hydrocortisone begins to work.",
            "opt_2d": "Incorrect. The client is hyponatremic (Na+ 124). Administering a hypotonic solution like 0.45% NaCl would further lower the serum sodium, worsening the hyponatremia and potentially causing cerebral edema. The appropriate fluid for resuscitation in this case is 0.9% sodium chloride.",
            "opt_2e": "Incorrect. The client is in shock with severe hypotension. Placing them in a high-Fowler's position would cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, further decreasing venous return and cardiac output, which would worsen the hypotension. The client should be kept supine or in a Trendelenburg position.",
            "opt_2f": "Incorrect. While severe hyperkalemia can be an indication for hemodialysis, it is not the immediate first-line action. Medical management with insulin/dextrose, calcium gluconate (if ordered), and addressing the root cause (adrenal crisis) must be initiated first. Dialysis is considered if these measures fail or if there is severe renal failure."
