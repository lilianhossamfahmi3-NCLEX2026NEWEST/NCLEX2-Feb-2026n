In adrenal crisis, a deficiency of cortisol impairs the body's ability to maintain vascular tone and respond to catecholamines. Cortisol normally upregulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on blood vessels, enhancing their sensitivity to vasoconstrictors. Without sufficient cortisol, blood vessels dilate, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance and hypotension. This hypotension is often unresponsive to fluid resuscitation alone.",

Aldosterone normally stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in the distal tubules of the nephron, promoting sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Without aldosterone, potassium accumulates in the extracellular fluid, leading to hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias by affecting the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to altered excitability and conduction.",

Long-term exogenous steroid use suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When exogenous steroids are suddenly stopped, the adrenal glands, which have been suppressed, are unable to produce sufficient cortisol to meet the body's needs. This leads to iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency and can precipitate an adrenal crisis, especially during times of stress (e.g., illness, injury, surgery). The lack of cortisol disrupts glucose metabolism, fluid balance, and blood pressure regulation.",

Elevated lactate levels are a marker of shock severity and indicate that the body is not adequately perfusing its tissues.

Tall, peaked T-waves are an early sign of hyperkalemia and can progress to other arrhythmias, such as prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, sine wave pattern, and ultimately, ventricular fibrillation or asystole. These ECG changes reflect the disruption of normal cardiac electrical activity caused by the altered potassium gradient across cardiac cell membranes.",

Further investigation for infection may still be warranted, but it is not the most immediate concern.",

In the absence of cortisol, blood vessels are less responsive to norepinephrine, and the drug may not be able to effectively raise blood pressure.
