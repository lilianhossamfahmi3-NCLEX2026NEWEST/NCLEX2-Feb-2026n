        "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is contraindicated and constitutes a potentially life-threatening error. The client's vital signs show severe bradycardia (HR 42 bpm) and the ECG confirms a second-degree AV block, Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach). Metoprolol would further suppress the heart rate and AV node conduction, potentially causing complete heart block or asystole. In Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), the bradycardia is a compensatory response to the severe hypertension. Beta-blockers are generally avoided in AD due to the risk of exacerbating bradycardia. Recognizing this contraindication is a critical safety stop.",
        "pathophysiology": "Metoprolol is a beta-1 selective adrenergic antagonist. It blocks the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the heart, leading to decreased heart rate, decreased contractility, and decreased AV node conduction. In the setting of bradycardia and AV block, this effect can be detrimental. Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a syndrome in which a noxious stimulus below the level of a spinal cord injury (typically T6 or above) triggers a massive sympathetic response. This leads to severe hypertension. The body attempts to compensate for this hypertension by stimulating the vagus nerve, leading to bradycardia.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Always assess heart rate and rhythm before administering beta-blockers. Be aware of the contraindications of beta-blockers, including bradycardia and AV block. In patients with spinal cord injuries, consider the possibility of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) when assessing vital sign changes."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_02",
        "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting classic signs of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency characterized by a massive, uninhibited sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury (T6 or above). The immediate priority is to sit the client upright (elevate HOB to 90 degrees) to induce orthostatic hypotension and to promptly identify and remove the stimulus. The new, tight leg dressing is the most likely culprit. This non-pharmacological action is the fastest and safest first step to reduce blood pressure and prevent further complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "pathophysiology": "Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) occurs because the spinal cord injury disrupts the normal communication between the brain and the sympathetic nervous system below the level of the injury. A noxious stimulus (e.g., tight clothing, full bladder, fecal impaction, pressure ulcer) triggers an exaggerated sympathetic response, leading to vasoconstriction and a rapid increase in blood pressure. The brain attempts to inhibit this response via the vagus nerve, resulting in bradycardia. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous pooling in the lower extremities, reducing venous return and lowering blood pressure. Removing the noxious stimulus breaks the cycle of sympathetic activation.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a medical emergency. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent serious complications. Always consider AD in patients with spinal cord injuries above T6 who present with sudden hypertension, headache, and bradycardia. Remember the mnemonic: SIT UP (Sit up, Identify and remove the stimulus, Take blood pressure, Use medications if needed, Provide education)."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_03",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Although the client's blood pressure is dangerously high (210/118 mmHg) and meets the criteria for hydralazine administration, administering medication is not the initial priority. The primary intervention for AD is to remove the underlying cause. Pharmacological treatment is only initiated if hypertension persists after the stimulus has been removed or cannot be immediately identified. Addressing the cause first may prevent the need for medication and its associated side effects.",
        "pathophysiology": "Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator that relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessels, leading to a decrease in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. While hydralazine can effectively lower blood pressure in AD, it does not address the underlying cause of the sympathetic overactivity. Removing the noxious stimulus is essential to prevent recurrence of AD.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Always prioritize non-pharmacological interventions before administering medications, especially in emergency situations. In Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), focus on identifying and removing the noxious stimulus before administering antihypertensive medications."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_04",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The bradycardia and AV block are clinical manifestations of the intense parasympathetic (vagal) response that occurs in AD, attempting to counteract the severe hypertension. While the finding is alarming, it is a symptom of the underlying AD. The most immediate action is to treat the AD, which will likely resolve the cardiac conduction issue. A cardiology consult may be warranted later if the block persists despite resolution of the AD, but it is not the immediate life-saving priority. Addressing the underlying cause of the AD is more critical at this time.",
        "pathophysiology": "The severe hypertension in Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) triggers a baroreceptor reflex, leading to increased vagal tone. This increased vagal tone slows the heart rate and can cause AV block. Treating the underlying AD will reduce the sympathetic drive and allow the parasympathetic nervous system to return to normal, resolving the bradycardia and AV block.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Treat the underlying cause of a problem before addressing the symptoms. In Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), the bradycardia and AV block are secondary to the hypertension and will likely resolve with treatment of the AD."
