A new compression dressing was applied to the site. Client is now reporting a severe, pounding headache and appears flushed from the chest up.

The client's vital signs show severe bradycardia (HR 42) and the ECG confirms a second-degree AV block. Metoprolol would further suppress the heart rate and conductivity, potentially causing complete heart block or asystole. Recognizing this contraindication is a critical safety stop."

                "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting classic signs of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency characterized by a massive sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus below the level of injury. The immediate priority is to sit the client upright (elevate HOB to 90 degrees) to induce orthostatic hypotension and to promptly identify and remove the stimulus. The new, tight leg dressing is the most likely culprit. This non-pharmacological action is the fastest and safest first step."

                "optionId": "opt_03",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Although the client's blood pressure is dangerously high and meets the criteria for hydralazine administration, administering medication is not the initial priority. The primary intervention for AD is to remove the underlying cause. Pharmacological treatment is only initiated if hypertension persists after the stimulus has been removed or cannot be immediately identified."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The bradycardia and AV block are clinical manifestations of the intense parasympathetic (vagal) response that occurs in AD, attempting to counteract the severe hypertension. While the finding is alarming, it is a symptom of the underlying AD. The most immediate action is to treat the AD, which will likely resolve the cardiac conduction issue. A cardiology consult may be warranted later if the block persists, but it is not the immediate life-saving priority."
