      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's ECG shows significant signs of cardiac toxicity from hyperkalemia (bradycardia, peaked T waves, prolonged PR, widened QRS). Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential, making cells more excitable initially, but prolonged hyperkalemia leads to decreased excitability and impaired repolarization. This can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac cell membrane by increasing the threshold potential, making the heart less susceptible to arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia. This is the highest priority medication to administer.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart, preventing arrhythmias. Administer slowly and monitor the client's ECG and blood pressure during administration."
    },
    "opt2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works by blocking aldosterone receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. By blocking aldosterone, spironolactone increases sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion, leading to increased serum potassium levels. Administering this medication to a client with a potassium level of 7.1 mEq/L would be a severe medication error, worsening the life-threatening hyperkalemia. The nurse must recognize this contraindication and withhold the medication, then notify the provider.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always check potassium levels before administering potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia can be life-threatening. Monitor for signs of hyperkalemia, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and arrhythmias."
    },
    "opt3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. After stabilizing the cardiac membrane with calcium, the next priority is to lower the serum potassium level. IV regular insulin works quickly to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cells, which actively transports potassium into the cells, lowering serum potassium levels. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as the client's baseline glucose is normal. Without dextrose, insulin administration could lead to dangerous hypoglycemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "When administering insulin for hyperkalemia, monitor blood glucose levels closely for hypoglycemia. Have dextrose readily available."
    },
    "opt4": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Given the critical potassium level and significant ECG changes, the client is at high risk for sudden, lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia can cause a variety of arrhythmias, including bradycardia, heart blocks, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is an essential, independent nursing action to ensure immediate detection of and response to any deterioration in cardiac rhythm.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial. Be prepared to administer antiarrhythmic medications and perform CPR if necessary."
    },
    "opt5": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which is known to cause hyperkalemia by decreasing aldosterone secretion. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion, so decreased aldosterone levels can lead to potassium retention and hyperkalemia. Administering this medication would exacerbate the client's condition. It is contraindicated in cases of acute kidney injury and severe hyperkalemia. The nurse must withhold this medication and clarify the order with the provider.",
      "clinicalPearl": "ACE inhibitors can cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with kidney disease. Monitor potassium levels closely. Consider alternative antihypertensive medications."
    },
    "opt6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a repeat potassium level is necessary, waiting 6 hours is unsafe and inappropriate. The client's response to emergent treatment (insulin, dextrose, calcium) should be evaluated much sooner, typically within 1 hour after the interventions, to determine if further action is needed. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and determine if additional interventions, such as dialysis or sodium polystyrene sulfonate, are necessary to further lower the potassium level.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Following emergent treatment for hyperkalemia, potassium levels should be rechecked within 1 hour to assess treatment effectiveness. Be prepared to administer additional treatments if the potassium level remains elevated."

    "background": "The client reports taking extra ibuprofen for knee pain and ran out of furosemide three days ago. He is also prescribed lisinopril and spironolactone. The client's CKD impairs potassium excretion, and NSAIDs like ibuprofen can exacerbate kidney injury and hyperkalemia.",
    "assessment": "The client is lethargic, with bilateral lower extremity muscle strength 3/5. Vital signs show bradycardia with a heart rate of 52 bpm. ECG at 1415 shows sinus bradycardia, peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and widened QRS complex, all consistent with severe hyperkalemia.",
    "recommendation": "The nurse should immediately administer calcium gluconate 1 g IVPB over 10 minutes to stabilize the cardiac membrane, administer regular insulin 10 units IV push with dextrose 50% 25 g IV push to shift potassium intracellularly, place the client on a continuous cardiac monitor to detect arrhythmias, and withhold the scheduled 1500 dose of spironolactone to prevent further potassium elevation. A repeat potassium level should be obtained within 1 hour to evaluate treatment effectiveness and guide further management."
