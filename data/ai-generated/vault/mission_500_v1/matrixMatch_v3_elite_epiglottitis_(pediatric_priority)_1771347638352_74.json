The client is visibly anxious, sitting upright on the gurney, leaning forward with support from his hands (tripod position). He is drooling and has a muffled, 'hot potato' voice. Stridor is audible without a stethoscope. Mother reports the child completed his final cycle of chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) one week ago. She also states they live in a rural area and had to wait for a relative to drive them, a 2-hour trip."
