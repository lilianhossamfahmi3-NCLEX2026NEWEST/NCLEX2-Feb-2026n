      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a recent history of head trauma raises concern for intracranial bleeding, the client denies loss of consciousness, and the non-contrast head CT shows no evidence of acute hemorrhage. Therefore, this finding is less critical than the platelet count.  Alteplase administration in the presence of thrombocytopenia carries a significantly higher risk of spontaneous hemorrhage. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots.  In a client with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), the body's ability to form clots is already compromised.  Administering alteplase further impairs clot formation, increasing the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize absolute contraindications to medications. A negative head CT does not negate the risk of bleeding in a thrombocytopenic patient receiving a thrombolytic.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. While elevated, this blood pressure is below the 185/110 mmHg threshold that requires treatment *before* alteplase administration. The labetalol administered at 0930 likely contributed to lowering the blood pressure. The priority is the absolute contraindication of thrombocytopenia.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of hemorrhage during thrombolytic therapy.  However, current guidelines allow for controlled blood pressure within a specific range before initiating alteplase.  Uncontrolled hypertension is a relative contraindication, but it can be managed. Thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Know the blood pressure parameters for alteplase administration. While important, it's a modifiable risk factor, unlike a low platelet count.",

The absence of hemorrhage allows consideration of alteplase for ischemic stroke, assuming other criteria are met.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase lyses clots. If a stroke is hemorrhagic (caused by bleeding), alteplase would worsen the bleeding, leading to increased brain damage and potentially death.  A CT scan is essential to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Always confirm the absence of hemorrhage on a CT scan before administering alteplase. This is a fundamental safety check.",

Administering alteplase in this situation significantly increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and other serious bleeding complications. The nurse must immediately withhold the medication and notify the healthcare provider.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Platelets are essential for blood clot formation.  Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that breaks down existing clots.  In a client with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), the body's ability to form new clots to stop bleeding is severely impaired.  Administering alteplase further reduces the body's ability to control bleeding, leading to a high risk of hemorrhage.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Memorize the absolute contraindications to alteplase. Thrombocytopenia is a critical one that can have devastating consequences if overlooked.",
