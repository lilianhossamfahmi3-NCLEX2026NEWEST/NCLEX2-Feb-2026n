Last known well time was 0800 (2 hours ago). The client is alert but confused. During the initial assessment, [client states he slipped and hit his head on a cot at a local shelter a few days ago] but denies loss of consciousness and states it was 'just a bump'. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 14."

However, the client described it as a 'bump', and more importantly, the non-contrast head CT is negative for any hemorrhage. The thrombocytopenia identified in the lab results is an absolute and definitive contraindication that presents a more immediate and non-negotiable safety risk."

            "rationale": "This finding does not contraindicate alteplase administration. Current guidelines state that blood pressure must be lowered to and maintained below 185/110 mmHg before initiating thrombolytic therapy. This client's blood pressure is within the acceptable range, likely due to the recent administration of labetalol."

The purpose of the initial non-contrast head CT is to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, which would be an absolute contraindication. This negative finding supports, rather than opposes, the decision to proceed with thrombolysis, assuming no other contraindications exist."

            "rationale": "This is the correct finding. A platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ is an absolute contraindication for the administration of alteplase. Proceeding with thrombolytic therapy in a client with significant thrombocytopenia poses an extremely high and unacceptable risk of life-threatening intracranial or systemic hemorrhage. This is a critical 'safety stop' that requires the nurse to withhold the medication and notify the provider immediately."
