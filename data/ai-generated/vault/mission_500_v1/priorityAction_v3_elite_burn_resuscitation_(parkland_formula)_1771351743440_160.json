While this typically suggests a need for more fluid, multiple data points indicate the client is developing life-threatening pulmonary edema/ARDS from over-resuscitation or a severe inhalation injury. These include worsening hypoxemia (SpO2 88%), tachypnea (RR 32), bilateral crackles, and CXR findings. Increasing the fluid rate would accelerate respiratory failure and is contraindicated."

Administering an opioid like morphine would cause respiratory depression, worsening the already critical respiratory status (RR 32, SpO2 88%). The priority is to address the cause of the restlessness, which is inadequate oxygenation."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. While circumferential chest burns can restrict ventilation and require an escharotomy, the clinical picture points more strongly to a pulmonary problem rather than a mechanical restriction. The presence of a moist cough, bilateral crackles on auscultation, and diffuse opacities on the CXR are hallmark signs of fluid in the lungs (edema/ARDS), which would not be resolved by an escharotomy. The immediate threat is hypoxemia from a non-mechanical cause."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is in respiratory distress with significant hypoxemia (SpO2 88% despite 6L NC). The most critical, immediate, independent nursing action is to support oxygenation and ventilation. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to improve diaphragmatic excursion and lung expansion. Applying a non-rebreather mask delivers the highest possible concentration of oxygen via a low-flow system. This action directly addresses the life-threatening 'Airway, Breathing' problem while the nurse prepares to notify the provider for further intervention (e.g., stopping fluids, diuretics, potential intubation)."
