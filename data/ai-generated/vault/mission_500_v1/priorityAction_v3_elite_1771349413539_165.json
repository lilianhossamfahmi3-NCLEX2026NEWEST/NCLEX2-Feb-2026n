Placed on continuous fetal monitoring, fetus is reactive. Client reports a persistent frontal headache, rated 6/10, unrelieved by acetaminophen. Also reports 'heartburn that won't go away' in the epigastric region and seeing 'sparkles' intermittently. States, 'I feel so swollen and puffy.' States she missed her last two prenatal appointments because her partner works nights and she has no other transportation. \n\n**1800:** Client's headache now 8/10. Epigastric pain persists. +2 pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are +3 with no clonus. Urine output 40 mL/hr over the last 2 hours. Provider notified of worsening symptoms; new lab work ordered."
