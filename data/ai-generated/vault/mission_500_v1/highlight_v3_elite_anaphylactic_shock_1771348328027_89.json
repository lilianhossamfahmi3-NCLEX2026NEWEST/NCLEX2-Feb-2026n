Received third dose of infliximab 250 mg IV over 2 hours, infusion completed 30 minutes ago. Pre-medicated with acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV. Client used a hospital-provided translator for communication. Scattered urticarial rash noted on chest and back, non-pruritic at this time. Denies nausea or abdominal pain. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Client appears restless and anxious. Complains of feeling 'dizzy' when sitting up. States his 'throat feels tight'. Skin is cool and clammy to touch. Capillary refill is 4 seconds on fingernails."

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate anaphylactic shock, a severe type I hypersensitivity reaction. Infliximab can trigger mast cell and basophil degranulation, releasing histamine and other mediators. This leads to systemic vasodilation (causing hypotension and dizziness), increased capillary permeability (resulting in fluid shift and cool, clammy skin), and bronchospasm/laryngeal edema ('tight throat'). Restlessness and anxiety are early signs of cerebral hypoxia due to decreased perfusion. Delayed capillary refill signifies impaired peripheral circulation. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent respiratory arrest and cardiac collapse. Clinical Pearl: Always assess for anaphylaxis after administering medications known to cause hypersensitivity reactions, even if the patient has tolerated them previously.",

      {
        "text": "Scattered urticarial rash noted on chest and back",
        "rationale": "Urticaria is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, resulting from histamine release causing vasodilation and increased permeability in the skin. However, in the context of potential cardiovascular collapse, the nurse must prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation. Urticaria alone does not indicate the severity of the reaction. Clinical Pearl: Urticaria can be absent in some anaphylactic reactions, so its absence doesn't rule out anaphylaxis."
      },
      {
        "text": "Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally",
        "rationale": "While wheezing is a common sign of anaphylaxis due to bronchoconstriction, the absence of wheezing does not exclude a severe reaction. Laryngeal edema, indicated by the 'tight throat' sensation, is a more immediate threat to the airway in this case. Relying solely on lung sounds could delay critical interventions. Clinical Pearl: Upper airway obstruction can occur rapidly in anaphylaxis, even with clear lung sounds initially."

While important for overall care, it's not a priority in recognizing anaphylactic shock. Clinical Pearl: Always consider the patient's medical history, but prioritize assessment findings that indicate acute changes in condition."

    "Situation": "45-year-old male post-infliximab infusion exhibiting signs of anaphylaxis.",
    "Background": "History of Crohn's disease, received infliximab 250 mg IV at 1200, pre-medicated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine at 1130. Third dose of infliximab. Limited English proficiency, using translator.",
    "Assessment": "1430: Restless, anxious, dizzy upon sitting, reports 'throat feels tight', cool and clammy skin, capillary refill 4 seconds. BP 88/50, HR 124, RR 22, SpO2 94% on RA. Lactate 4.2 mmol/L. Scattered urticarial rash noted.",
    "Recommendation": "Suspect anaphylactic shock. Needs immediate intervention: Stop infusion, administer epinephrine IM, administer oxygen, elevate legs, and prepare for intubation. Notify provider immediately and prepare for transfer to ICU. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential."
