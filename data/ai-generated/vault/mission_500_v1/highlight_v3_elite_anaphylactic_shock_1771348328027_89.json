Received third dose of infliximab 250 mg IV over 2 hours, infusion completed 30 minutes ago. Pre-medicated with acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV. Client used a hospital-provided translator for communication. Scattered urticarial rash noted on chest and back, non-pruritic at this time. Denies nausea or abdominal pain. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Client appears restless and anxious. Complains of feeling 'dizzy' when sitting up. States his 'throat feels tight'. Skin is cool and clammy to touch. Capillary refill is 4 seconds on fingernails."

        "correct": "The combination of these five findings points directly to anaphylactic shock, a form of distributive shock characterized by massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to cardiovascular collapse. Restlessness/anxiety is an early sign of cerebral hypoxia. Dizziness upon sitting up indicates significant orthostatic hypotension due to inadequate circulatory volume. A 'tight throat' signifies life-threatening laryngeal edema and impending airway obstruction. Cool, clammy skin and delayed capillary refill (>3 seconds) are classic signs of peripheral hypoperfusion as the body shunts blood to vital organs. Recognizing this cluster of cues is critical to stop any further routine action and immediately activate an emergency response, including the administration of epinephrine.",

By itself, it does not indicate the life-threatening airway compromise or hemodynamic instability present with anaphylactic shock. The nurse must prioritize signs of airway, breathing, and circulation collapse over skin manifestations."

The primary airway threat in this client is laryngeal edema (indicated by 'throat feels tight'), not bronchoconstriction. Relying on clear lung sounds could lead to a fatal delay in treatment."
