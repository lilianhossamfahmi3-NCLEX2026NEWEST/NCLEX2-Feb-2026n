Attempting to defibrillate a client while high-flow oxygen is being delivered directly to the face and chest creates a significant risk of fire and sparks, which can cause serious burns to the client and harm the resuscitation team. The nurse must immediately call out to stop the procedure and ensure the oxygen source is safely removed before the shock is delivered. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' or 'SAFETY STOP' moment."
