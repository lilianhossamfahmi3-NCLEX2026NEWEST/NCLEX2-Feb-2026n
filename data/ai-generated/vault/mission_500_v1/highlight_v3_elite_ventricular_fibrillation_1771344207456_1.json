      "part2": "Initiating high-quality chest compressions and connecting the client to a cardiac monitor/defibrillator are essential components of Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) algorithms. These actions are crucial for maintaining circulation and assessing the client's cardiac rhythm.",
      "part3": "Identifying Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) as a shockable rhythm and confirming correct defibrillator pad placement are vital steps in preparing for defibrillation. VF is a chaotic electrical activity in the ventricles that prevents effective cardiac output.",
      "part4": "Delivering a biphasic shock for VF, immediately resuming chest compressions, and initiating bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilations with 100% oxygen are standard ACLS interventions. The goal is to terminate the VF and restore a perfusing rhythm.",
      "part5": "Epinephrine is administered during cardiac arrest to promote vasoconstriction, increasing blood flow to the heart and brain. Passive oxygenation with a non-rebreather mask is sometimes used, but the high flow of oxygen near the chest creates a fire hazard during defibrillation.",
      "part6": "**Correct.** This entry describes a critical safety violation. Delivering a defibrillation shock in the presence of high-flow oxygen being delivered via a non-rebreather mask poses a significant fire risk. Oxygen supports combustion, and sparks from the defibrillator can ignite the oxygen-rich environment, leading to serious burns for the client and potential harm to the resuscitation team. The nurse must immediately intervene to ensure the oxygen source is removed or temporarily displaced away from the chest area before the shock is delivered. This is a 'SAFETY STOP' moment. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always ensure supplemental oxygen is temporarily removed or displaced away from the chest area before defibrillation to prevent fire. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by rapid, uncoordinated electrical activity in the ventricles, resulting in the absence of effective cardiac output. Defibrillation delivers a controlled electrical shock to depolarize the heart muscle, allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to regain control and restore a normal heart rhythm. However, the presence of high-flow oxygen creates a fire hazard due to the potential for sparks from the defibrillator to ignite the oxygen-rich environment. This can lead to severe burns and compromise the resuscitation effort."
