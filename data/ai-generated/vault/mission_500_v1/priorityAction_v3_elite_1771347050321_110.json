    "correct": "The client's presentation at 13:45 is indicative of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. The pathophysiology involves a one-way valve effect where air enters the pleural space with each inspiration but cannot escape. This leads to increased intrapleural pressure, causing lung collapse and mediastinal shift towards the contralateral side. The shift compresses the heart and great vessels, impeding venous return and causing obstructive shock. Jugular venous distention (JVD) occurs due to increased central venous pressure. The trachea deviates away from the affected side due to the pressure. Hypotension and tachycardia are compensatory mechanisms that quickly decompensate. The priority is immediate needle decompression to release the trapped air and restore hemodynamic stability. Activating the RRT ensures adequate resources and expertise are available.",
