The combination of severe respiratory distress refractory to oxygen, unilateral absence of breath sounds, tracheal deviation to the contralateral side, jugular venous distention, and profound hypotension with tachycardia indicates obstructive shock. Air has entered the pleural space and cannot escape, causing the lung to collapse and the mediastinum (heart, great vessels, trachea) to shift. This shift kinks the great vessels, severely impeding venous return to the heart, which causes the obstructive shock and will lead to cardiac arrest if not immediately relieved. The absolute priority is to facilitate the release of this trapped air via needle decompression. Activating the RRT and preparing the necessary equipment is the most critical and time-sensitive nursing action to save the client's life.",
