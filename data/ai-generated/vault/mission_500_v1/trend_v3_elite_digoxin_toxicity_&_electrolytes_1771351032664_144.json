      "Client report of nausea and 'yellow haze' vision": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. Nausea, anorexia, fatigue, and visual disturbances (xanthopsia or 'yellow-tinged vision') are classic, hallmark signs of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin toxicity occurs due to the drug's inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium, disrupting cellular function, particularly in cardiac and neuronal tissues. The subjective report is a critical cue indicating potential toxicity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Visual disturbances, especially yellow-tinged vision (xanthopsia), are highly specific indicators of digoxin toxicity and should prompt immediate investigation."
      },
      "Heart rate of 54 bpm": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node by increasing vagal tone and prolonging the refractory period. This effect is exacerbated by hypokalemia. A heart rate below 60 bpm is a cardinal sign of digoxin toxicity and requires immediate attention. The trend from 78 bpm to 54 bpm is a significant decline, indicating worsening AV node suppression.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Bradycardia in a patient on digoxin, especially with other signs of toxicity, warrants immediate withholding of the drug and notification of the provider. Monitor ECG for AV blocks."
      },
      "Potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. Hypokalemia (K+ < 3.5 mEq/L) potentiates the effects of digoxin, increasing the risk of toxicity even with a therapeutic drug level. Hypokalemia increases digoxin binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, enhancing its inhibitory effect and predisposing the patient to arrhythmias and other toxic effects. This critically low level, combined with other signs, is highly significant.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Hypokalemia significantly increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Concurrent use of potassium-wasting diuretics like furosemide necessitates careful monitoring of potassium levels."
      },
      "Digoxin level of 2.3 ng/mL": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. The therapeutic range for digoxin is typically 0.8-2.0 ng/mL. A level of 2.3 ng/mL is toxic and confirms the clinical suspicion based on the client's symptoms and other lab values. Elevated digoxin levels directly correlate with increased inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to cellular dysfunction and toxicity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Always correlate digoxin levels with the patient's clinical presentation. A 'therapeutic' level can still be toxic in the presence of hypokalemia or other predisposing factors."
      },
      "Blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. While this blood pressure is lower than the previous readings, it is not dangerously low (hypotensive shock). Bradycardia and arrhythmias from digoxin toxicity can cause hypotension, but compared to the other findings, this is a secondary sign and not the most significant cue. The primary concern is the direct effect of digoxin on cardiac conduction and cellular function.",
        "clinicalPearl": "While hypotension can occur with digoxin toxicity, it is often a later sign. Focus on the more specific indicators like bradycardia, visual disturbances, and ECG changes."
      },
      "Client lives alone": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. This is an important social determinant of health (SDOH) factor for discharge planning and education. However, it is not significant for the client's immediate, life-threatening clinical condition of digoxin toxicity. The priority is addressing the acute physiological threat.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Social determinants of health are crucial for long-term care, but in acute situations, physiological stability takes precedence."

    "part2": {
      "opt1": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. The highest priority nursing action is to prevent further harm. The client is exhibiting clear signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity, including bradycardia, visual disturbances, and an elevated digoxin level. Administering another dose would be unsafe and could precipitate a lethal arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' action.",
        "clinicalPearl": "When digoxin toxicity is suspected, the first action is always to withhold the medication. This prevents further accumulation of the drug and reduces the risk of life-threatening complications."
      },
      "opt2": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. While the potassium is critically low and needs replacement, the nurse's independent scope of practice does not include diagnosing the full extent of the problem and initiating treatment without consulting the provider. The provider needs the full clinical picture (toxicity signs, ECG, labs) to determine the safest and most appropriate route and rate of potassium replacement, which may need to be IV. Rapid IV potassium administration can cause cardiac arrhythmias.",
        "clinicalPearl": "While hypokalemia needs correction, it's crucial to involve the provider to determine the safest route and rate of potassium administration, especially in the context of digoxin toxicity."
      },
      "opt3": {
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "CORRECT. After withholding the medication to ensure immediate safety, the nurse must immediately notify the healthcare provider. The provider needs to be aware of the bradycardia, ECG changes, lab results, and signs of toxicity to prescribe further interventions, which may include digoxin immune Fab (Digibind) and electrolyte replacement. Digibind binds to digoxin, preventing it from binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump and reversing its toxic effects.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Prompt communication with the provider is essential for initiating appropriate treatment, which may include Digibind administration and electrolyte correction."
      },
      "opt4": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. Requesting an antiemetic treats a symptom (nausea) but ignores the life-threatening root cause (digoxin toxicity). This would delay definitive and essential treatment. Addressing the underlying cause of the nausea is paramount.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Treating symptoms without addressing the underlying cause can delay critical interventions and worsen the patient's condition."
      },
      "opt5": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. While furosemide is a potassium-wasting diuretic that likely contributed to the hypokalemia, withholding it is not the most immediate priority. The direct threat is the digoxin toxicity. The provider will likely address the furosemide, but the nurse's first actions must be to stop the digoxin and report the critical findings.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Focus on addressing the most immediate threat to the patient's life, which in this case is the digoxin toxicity."
      },
      "opt6": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "INCORRECT. The client's symptoms are not related to hypoglycemia. Focusing on food intake is irrelevant to the immediate life-threatening arrhythmia risk and delays critical interventions. The symptoms are directly related to digoxin toxicity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Always prioritize interventions based on the patient's most pressing clinical needs. In this case, addressing the digoxin toxicity is paramount."

  "background": "The client has been receiving furosemide, digoxin 0.125mg, and lisinopril daily. Nurses' notes from the previous day indicated the client was resting comfortably with stable vital signs. However, today the client reports feeling 'unusually tired' and 'queasy' with 'yellow haze' vision and several loose stools since yesterday evening. The client also expresses concern about managing his diet and medications after discharge.",
  "assessment": "Current vital signs show a heart rate of 54 bpm (irregular), blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 95%. Laboratory results from today show a potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L, magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL, and a digoxin level of 2.3 ng/mL. An ECG from 0830 (08:30) today shows atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response (average rate 52 bpm), frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and ST-segment depression ('scooping') in leads V4-V6. These findings are indicative of potential digoxin toxicity.",
  "recommendation": "Based on the client's presentation, the nurse should withhold the scheduled 0900 (09:00) dose of digoxin and immediately notify the healthcare provider of the findings.
