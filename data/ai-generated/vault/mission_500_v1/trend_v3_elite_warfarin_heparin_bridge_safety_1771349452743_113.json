            "rationale": "Incorrect. An INR of 1.3 is subtherapeutic for a client with atrial fibrillation. While this finding is important for managing anticoagulation, it is not the finding that requires immediate follow-up in this context. Acting on this data point in isolation (by giving warfarin) would be a critical error given the other clinical data."
        },
        "c0_o1": {
            "rationale": "Correct. A new headache and change in level of consciousness (lethargy) in a client on anticoagulation are red-flag symptoms for a potential intracranial bleed. These neurological changes are critical cues that demand immediate investigation."
        },
        "c0_o2": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The vital signs trend shows increasing systolic blood pressure, widening pulse pressure (182-80 = 102 mmHg), and bradycardia (HR decreasing to 60). This triad of findings is known as Cushing's triad, a classic and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP)."
        },
        "c0_o3": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While a history of falls is a significant risk factor for bleeding and is considered when deciding on anticoagulation, it is part of the client's history, not a new finding that requires immediate follow-up. It provides context but is not an acute change."
        },
        "c0_o4": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The head CT provides definitive evidence of an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift. This is a life-threatening emergency and is the most critical piece of data, confirming the suspicion raised by the neurological and vital sign changes."
        },
        "c1_o0": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Ischemic stroke is caused by a clot occluding a vessel. This client is experiencing a bleed into the brain parenchyma, which is a hemorrhagic, not ischemic, event. The head CT confirms hemorrhage."
        },
        "c1_o1": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a complication of heparin therapy characterized by a significant drop in platelet count (typically >50%). This client's platelet count is normal (210,000/mm³), ruling out HIT."
        },
        "c1_o2": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's clinical presentation (headache, lethargy), vital sign trend (Cushing's triad), and definitive head CT findings (intraparenchymal hemorrhage) all converge on the diagnosis of an acute hemorrhagic stroke, a life-threatening complication of anticoagulation therapy."
        },
        "c2_o0": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering warfarin, an anticoagulant, to a client with an active intracranial hemorrhage would be a catastrophic error. This action would worsen the bleeding, increase intracranial pressure, and could lead to brain herniation and death. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' moment."
        },
        "c2_o1": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The immediate priority is to stop the source of anticoagulation that is contributing to the active bleed. The heparin infusion has a rapid onset and offset, and stopping it is the first and most critical independent nursing intervention to prevent further bleeding."
        },
        "c2_o2": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must immediately communicate these critical findings (neuro changes, Cushing's triad, CT result) to the healthcare provider using a structured method like SBAR. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical intervention, including possible neurosurgical consultation and reversal of anticoagulation."
        },
        "c2_o3": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The nurse should anticipate the need to reverse the effects of both heparin and warfarin. This involves preparing to administer agents such as protamine sulfate (for heparin) and Vitamin K and/or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC/Kcentra) for rapid warfarin reversal. This is an essential anticipatory action."
        },
        "c2_o4": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has a headache, administering an analgesic without addressing the underlying cause (intracranial bleed) is inappropriate and delays life-saving interventions. Furthermore, administering NSAIDs would be contraindicated as they can increase bleeding risk. The priority is to manage the bleed, which will in turn resolve the headache."
        },
        "c2_o5": {
            "rationale": "Correct. This client has a confirmed intracranial hemorrhage with mass effect, which is a neurological emergency. The nurse should anticipate and advocate for an immediate neurology and/or neurosurgery consultation for emergent management."
