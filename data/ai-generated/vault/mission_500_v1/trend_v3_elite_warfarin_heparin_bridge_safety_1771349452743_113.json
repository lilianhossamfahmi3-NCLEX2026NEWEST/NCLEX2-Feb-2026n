      "rationale": "Incorrect. An INR of 1.3 is subtherapeutic for a client with atrial fibrillation, indicating the warfarin is not yet providing adequate anticoagulation. While important for long-term management, it's not the priority given the acute changes. The priority is the new neurological changes and CT results.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Subtherapeutic INR requires adjustment, but acute neurological changes take precedence.",
      "pathophysiology": "Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk due to blood stasis and clot formation in the atria. Warfarin is used to prevent this by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. A subtherapeutic INR means these factors are not adequately suppressed, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events. However, in this case, the risk is hemorrhage, not thrombosis."
    },
    "c0_o1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. A new headache and change in level of consciousness (lethargy) in a client on anticoagulation are red-flag symptoms for a potential intracranial bleed. These neurological changes are critical cues that demand immediate investigation and intervention.",
      "clinicalPearl": "New headache/lethargy in anticoagulated patients warrants immediate investigation for intracranial hemorrhage.",
      "pathophysiology": "Anticoagulants, like warfarin and heparin, increase the risk of bleeding. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs when blood vessels in the brain rupture, leading to bleeding within the brain tissue. This bleeding can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to headache, altered mental status, and potentially life-threatening complications."
    },
    "c0_o2": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The vital signs trend shows increasing systolic blood pressure, widening pulse pressure (182-80 = 102 mmHg), and bradycardia (HR decreasing to 60). This triad of findings is known as Cushing's triad, a classic and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).",
      "clinicalPearl": "Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) is a late and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure.",
      "pathophysiology": "Cushing's triad is a physiological response to increased ICP. The hypertension is the body's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. The bradycardia is a reflex response to the hypertension, mediated by the vagus nerve. Irregular respirations occur due to pressure on the brainstem respiratory centers."
    },
    "c0_o3": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a history of falls is a significant risk factor for bleeding and is considered when deciding on anticoagulation, it is part of the client's history, not a new finding that requires immediate follow-up. It provides context but is not an acute change demanding immediate action.",
      "clinicalPearl": "History of falls is important for long-term management, not an acute finding in this scenario.",
      "pathophysiology": "A history of falls increases the risk of traumatic injuries, including head trauma. In a patient on anticoagulants, even minor head trauma can lead to significant bleeding complications. However, the history itself doesn't require immediate action unless there's a new fall or injury."
    },
    "c0_o4": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The head CT provides definitive evidence of an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift. This is a life-threatening emergency and is the most critical piece of data, confirming the suspicion raised by the neurological and vital sign changes.",
      "clinicalPearl": "A CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosing intracranial hemorrhage.",
      "pathophysiology": "Intraparenchymal hemorrhage refers to bleeding directly into the brain tissue. Midline shift indicates that the bleeding is causing significant pressure and displacement of brain structures, which can lead to herniation and death if not promptly addressed."
    },
    "c1_o0": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Ischemic stroke is caused by a clot occluding a vessel, leading to a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain. This client is experiencing a bleed into the brain parenchyma, which is a hemorrhagic, not ischemic, event. The head CT confirms hemorrhage, ruling out ischemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Ischemic stroke presents with neurological deficits, but without evidence of bleeding on CT scan.",
      "pathophysiology": "Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery supplying the brain, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing bleeding into the brain tissue."
    },
    "c1_o1": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a complication of heparin therapy characterized by a significant drop in platelet count (typically >50%). This client's platelet count is normal (210,000/mm³), ruling out HIT. HIT also typically presents 5-10 days after heparin initiation, not within 2 days.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is characterized by a decrease in platelets, not an increase in bleeding risk directly.",
      "pathophysiology": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated reaction where antibodies form against heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4). This leads to platelet activation and consumption, resulting in thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of thrombosis, not hemorrhage."
    },
    "c1_o2": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's clinical presentation (headache, lethargy), vital sign trend (Cushing's triad), and definitive head CT findings (intraparenchymal hemorrhage) all converge on the diagnosis of an acute hemorrhagic stroke, a life-threatening complication of anticoagulation therapy.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Acute hemorrhagic stroke is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to minimize brain damage.",
      "pathophysiology": "Acute hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing bleeding into the brain tissue. This bleeding can cause increased intracranial pressure, damage to brain cells, and potentially life-threatening complications. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke."
    },
    "c2_o0": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering warfarin, an anticoagulant, to a client with an active intracranial hemorrhage would be a catastrophic error. This action would worsen the bleeding, increase intracranial pressure, and could lead to brain herniation and death. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' moment.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Never administer anticoagulants to a patient with active bleeding or suspected intracranial hemorrhage.",
      "pathophysiology": "Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, prolonging the clotting time and increasing the risk of bleeding. Administering warfarin to a patient with an active intracranial hemorrhage would further impair the body's ability to stop the bleeding, leading to increased hemorrhage size and worsening neurological damage."
    },
    "c2_o1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The immediate priority is to stop the source of anticoagulation that is contributing to the active bleed. The heparin infusion has a rapid onset and offset, and stopping it is the first and most critical independent nursing intervention to prevent further bleeding.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Stopping the anticoagulant is the first step in managing a bleeding complication.",
      "pathophysiology": "Heparin is a direct thrombin inhibitor, preventing the formation of blood clots. By stopping the heparin infusion, the nurse reduces the anticoagulant effect, allowing the body's natural clotting mechanisms to begin to control the bleeding."
    },
    "c2_o2": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must immediately communicate these critical findings (neuro changes, Cushing's triad, CT result) to the healthcare provider using a structured method like SBAR. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical intervention, including possible neurosurgical consultation and reversal of anticoagulation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Prompt communication with the healthcare provider using SBAR is crucial in managing medical emergencies.",
      "pathophysiology": "Prompt communication allows the healthcare provider to make informed decisions about the patient's care, including ordering further diagnostic tests, initiating appropriate medical interventions, and consulting with specialists. Delaying communication can lead to delays in treatment and potentially worsen the patient's outcome."
    },
    "c2_o3": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The nurse should anticipate the need to reverse the effects of both heparin and warfarin. This involves preparing to administer agents such as protamine sulfate (for heparin) and Vitamin K and/or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC/Kcentra) for rapid warfarin reversal. This is an essential anticipatory action.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Anticipate the need for reversal agents when managing bleeding complications related to anticoagulants.",
      "pathophysiology": "Protamine sulfate is a heparin antagonist that binds to heparin, neutralizing its anticoagulant effect. Vitamin K is used to reverse the effects of warfarin by promoting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) contains concentrated clotting factors and can rapidly reverse the effects of warfarin."
    },
    "c2_o4": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has a headache, administering an analgesic without addressing the underlying cause (intracranial bleed) is inappropriate and delays life-saving interventions. Furthermore, administering NSAIDs would be contraindicated as they can increase bleeding risk. The priority is to manage the bleed, which will in turn resolve the headache.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Treating the underlying cause of a symptom is always the priority, especially in emergency situations.",
      "pathophysiology": "Analgesics, such as NSAIDs, can interfere with platelet function and increase the risk of bleeding. In the context of an intracranial hemorrhage, administering an analgesic without addressing the underlying cause could worsen the bleeding and delay appropriate treatment."
    },
    "c2_o5": {
      "rationale": "Correct. This client has a confirmed intracranial hemorrhage with mass effect, which is a neurological emergency. The nurse should anticipate and advocate for an immediate neurology and/or neurosurgery consultation for emergent management.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Neurology or neurosurgery consultation is essential for managing intracranial hemorrhage with mass effect.",
      "pathophysiology": "Neurologists and neurosurgeons are specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, including intracranial hemorrhage. They can provide expert guidance on the management of the hemorrhage, including potential surgical interventions to relieve pressure on the brain."
