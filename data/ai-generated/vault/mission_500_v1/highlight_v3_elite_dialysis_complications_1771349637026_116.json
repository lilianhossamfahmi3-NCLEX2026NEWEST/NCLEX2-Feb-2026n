The nurse must synthesize these findings, understand they represent an imminent threat of cardiovascular collapse, and take the immediate independent action of pausing the causative agent (the CRRT infusion) before notifying the provider.",

This value confirms the diagnosis and the severity of the situation."

The liver is responsible for metabolizing citrate; if its function is compromised, the risk of this life-threatening accumulation increases significantly. This highlights the importance of a thorough systems assessment in all clients, regardless of their presenting complaint."
