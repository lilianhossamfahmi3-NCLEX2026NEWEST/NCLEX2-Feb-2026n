    "correct": "The correct action is to immediately page the anesthesia provider to report the client's laboratory results. The client's clinical presentation (bleeding, pain, rigid uterus), vital sign trend (progressive tachycardia and hypotension), and fetal monitoring strip (Category III) are classic for a severe placental abruption. The critical laboratory data (thrombocytopenia, critically low fibrinogen, and massively elevated D-dimer) are hallmark signs of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), a common and life-threatening complication of abruption. In DIC, the body's clotting mechanisms are overactivated, leading to widespread clot formation and subsequent depletion of clotting factors, resulting in uncontrolled bleeding. Placing an epidural or spinal needle in a client with severe coagulopathy is absolutely contraindicated due to the high risk of causing an epidural hematoma, which can lead to permanent paralysis or neurological damage. The nurse's primary responsibility in this 'safety stop' moment is to recognize this life-threatening contraindication and communicate it immediately to the provider who is about to perform the dangerous procedure. This is the only action that prevents a potentially catastrophic iatrogenic injury.",
    "incorrect": "While the other options are necessary components of care for this critically ill client, they do not address the most immediate threat of iatrogenic harm. Administering fluids and blood addresses the hypovolemic shock resulting from hemorrhage. Consent is required, but these actions do not prevent the imminent, unsafe procedure of epidural placement. The anesthesia provider may attempt to place the epidural before the blood products have been fully administered, believing it will expedite the surgery. The nurse must intervene to stop this specific action based on the lab results.",
