States he felt 'okay' at first so he did not call an ambulance because he was worried about the cost. Reports increasing right-sided chest pain, rating it 8/10, and shortness of breath. Client is restless and agitated.\n\n15:30: Called to bedside by unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) for acute worsening of client's condition. Client is extremely agitated, gasping for air, and clutching his chest. On assessment, there is marked asymmetrical chest wall movement on the right side, subcutaneous emphysema noted on the right upper chest, and the client's trachea appears to be deviated to the left. Neck veins are distended."

The constellation of unilateral chest injury, worsening tachycardia, profound hypotension, severe hypoxia despite high-flow oxygen, and the late, critical signs of tracheal deviation and jugular vein distention confirm this clinical diagnosis. The pressure from the trapped air in the pleural space is collapsing the lung and shifting the mediastinum, which compresses the great vessels (vena cava) and the heart, preventing venous return and causing cardiovascular collapse (obstructive shock). The absolute priority is to relieve the pressure immediately. This requires preparing for needle decompression (thoracostomy), which is a life-saving intervention that cannot be delayed for diagnostic imaging. Administering a sedative like lorazepam to an agitated client in this state is a lethal error; the agitation is a sign of severe hypoxia, and a benzodiazepine will suppress the respiratory drive, leading to respiratory arrest and death.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices delay life-saving intervention or actively harm the client. Waiting for a repeat x-ray or CT scan is a fatal delay when the diagnosis can be made clinically. Treating the agitation with lorazepam is contraindicated as it will eliminate the client's respiratory drive. While increasing IV fluids might be done, it doesn't solve the primary mechanical problem of compression on the heart and is not the priority. Activating the RRT and placing the client upright are appropriate actions, but the question asks what to AVOID, making the administration of lorazepam the critical 'DON'T PROCEED' action.",
