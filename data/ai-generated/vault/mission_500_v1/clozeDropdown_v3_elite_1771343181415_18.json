Client is restless and agitated.\n\n1530: Called to bedside by unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) for acute worsening of client's condition. Client is extremely agitated, gasping for air, and clutching his chest. On assessment, there is marked asymmetrical chest wall movement on the right side, subcutaneous emphysema noted on the right upper chest, and the client's trachea appears to be deviated to the left. Neck veins are distended."

    "correct": "The client's presentation is a classic example of a simple pneumothorax rapidly progressing to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax, causing obstructive shock. The constellation of unilateral chest injury, worsening tachycardia (142 bpm), profound hypotension (84/48 mmHg), severe hypoxia (SaO2 85% on 15L non-rebreather), and the late, critical signs of tracheal deviation and jugular vein distention confirm this clinical diagnosis. The pressure from the trapped air in the pleural space is collapsing the lung and shifting the mediastinum, which compresses the great vessels (vena cava) and the heart, preventing venous return and causing cardiovascular collapse (obstructive shock). The absolute priority is to relieve the pressure immediately. This requires preparing for needle decompression (thoracostomy) using a large-bore (14-16 gauge) angiocatheter inserted into the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side, which is a life-saving intervention that cannot be delayed for diagnostic imaging. Administering a sedative like lorazepam to an agitated client in this state is a lethal error; the agitation is a sign of severe hypoxia, and a benzodiazepine will suppress the respiratory drive, leading to respiratory arrest and death.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices delay life-saving intervention or actively harm the client. Waiting for a repeat x-ray or CT scan is a fatal delay when the diagnosis can be made clinically. Treating the agitation with lorazepam is contraindicated as it will eliminate the client's respiratory drive. While increasing IV fluids might be done, it doesn't solve the primary mechanical problem of compression on the heart and is not the priority. Activating the RRT and placing the client upright are appropriate actions, but the question asks what to AVOID, making the administration of lorazepam the critical 'DON'T PROCEED' action.",

The client has hypotension, tachycardia, jugular vein distention, and tracheal deviation—hallmark signs of obstructive shock caused by the compression of the heart and great vessels from a tension pneumothorax. In a tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased pressure that collapses the lung, shifts the mediastinum, and impairs venous return to the heart. This results in decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock.",
