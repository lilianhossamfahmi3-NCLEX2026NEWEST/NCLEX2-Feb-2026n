        "correct": "The nurse must recognize the absolute contraindications to alteplase administration to prevent a life-threatening hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke. The two critical findings are the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.8 and the platelet count of 75,000/mm³. Alteplase is contraindicated in clients taking warfarin with an INR > 1.7. It is also absolutely contraindicated in clients with a platelet count < 100,000/mm³. Administering this powerful thrombolytic in the setting of pre-existing coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia would create an extremely high risk of fatal intracranial or systemic bleeding. The correct nursing action is to immediately withhold the medication and urgently notify the healthcare provider of these critical findings.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to identify these contraindications and proceeding with administration represents a critical safety error. The other findings are either indications for the therapy or are within manageable limits, creating a clinical picture where a less vigilant nurse might mistakenly proceed.",

                "justification": "This is an absolute contraindication. For clients with a recent or current use of oral anticoagulants like warfarin, an INR greater than 1.7 signifies a high level of anticoagulation. Administering alteplase would potentiate this effect, leading to a severe, unacceptably high risk of intracranial hemorrhage."

                "justification": "This is an absolute contraindication. A platelet count below 100,000/mm³ (thrombocytopenia) indicates impaired primary hemostasis. Alteplase dissolves existing clots, and with an insufficient number of platelets to form new plugs at sites of injury, the risk of spontaneous and uncontrollable bleeding is life-threatening."

                "justification": "This is a critical prerequisite *for* administering alteplase. The purpose of the initial non-contrast head CT is to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, as giving a thrombolytic in that case would be catastrophic. This negative finding confirms the stroke is ischemic and that the client is a potential candidate for therapy, assuming no other contraindications exist."
