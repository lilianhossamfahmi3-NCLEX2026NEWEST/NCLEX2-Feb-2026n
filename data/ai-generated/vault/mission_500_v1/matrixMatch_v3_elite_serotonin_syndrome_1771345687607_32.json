The client's presentation of altered mental status, autonomic instability (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (myoclonus) after receiving multiple serotonergic agents (sertraline, tramadol, ondansetron) is classic for Serotonin Syndrome. The foundational treatment is immediate discontinuation of all precipitating medications.",

            "option2": "Correct. This action is indicated. Benzodiazepines, like lorazepam, are a first-line treatment for Serotonin Syndrome.

            "option2": "Correct. This action is indicated. The client's temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F) represents severe, life-threatening hyperthermia. This is not a true fever (hypothalamic set-point change) but is caused by excessive muscle activity. Therefore, external cooling measures (cooling blankets, ice packs to axilla/groin) are essential to prevent CNS damage, multi-organ failure, and DIC.",

Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which can contribute to Serotonin Syndrome when combined with other serotonergic drugs like SSRIs and tramadol. The nurse must recognize this medication as a contributing factor and not administer it.",

            "option4": "Correct. This action is non-essential at this time. The priority is stabilizing the client from a life-threatening toxidrome.
