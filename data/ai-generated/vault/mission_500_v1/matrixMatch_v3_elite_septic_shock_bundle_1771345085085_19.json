In HFrEF, the heart's ability to pump blood effectively is compromised, leading to fluid overload and increased pressure within the ventricles. The ventricles release BNP in response to this stretch. In this client with known HFrEF, the extremely high BNP (normal <100 pg/mL) suggests acute decompensation and significant fluid overload. The standard septic shock fluid bolus could exacerbate pulmonary edema.

This occurs due to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, often secondary to heart failure or fluid overload.

The presence of pulmonary edema contraindicates a large fluid bolus, as it can worsen respiratory distress and lead to acute respiratory failure.
