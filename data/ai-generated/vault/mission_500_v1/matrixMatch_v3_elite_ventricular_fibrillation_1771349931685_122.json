    "row1_col3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "A serum magnesium of 1.1 mg/dL is critically low, indicating severe hypomagnesemia. Magnesium plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac electrical stability by regulating ion channels and intracellular calcium levels. Hypomagnesemia increases neuronal excitability and can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and Torsades de pointes, by prolonging the action potential duration and increasing the risk of early afterdepolarizations. Immediate magnesium replacement is essential to prevent recurrent arrhythmias.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Severe hypomagnesemia post-ROSC can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Prompt magnesium replacement is crucial. Monitor for signs of hypermagnesemia during replacement (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia)."
    },
    "row2_col3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "The ECG showing a markedly prolonged QTc interval (560 ms) is a critical, life-threatening finding. The QTc interval represents the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize after depolarization. A prolonged QTc interval indicates a delay in ventricular repolarization, making the heart vulnerable to developing Torsades de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. This is because the prolonged repolarization increases the likelihood of early afterdepolarizations, which can trigger the arrhythmia. The nurse must immediately recognize this risk and communicate it to the medical team.",
      "clinicalPearl": "A prolonged QTc interval post-ROSC increases the risk of Torsades de pointes. Monitor ECG closely and avoid QT-prolonging medications. Consider electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg++, Ca++) as potential causes and correct them promptly."
    },
    "row3_col3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "This represents a critical 'SAFETY STOP' or 'DON'T PROCEED' moment. Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors in the brain. However, it also has the side effect of prolonging the QT interval by blocking potassium channels in the heart, which delays ventricular repolarization. Administering it to a client who already has a markedly prolonged QTc (560 ms) could directly precipitate Torsades de pointes and another cardiac arrest. The nurse must withhold this medication and immediately contact the provider to question the order due to this contraindication.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with prolonged QTc intervals due to the risk of Torsades de pointes. Always check the QTc before administering haloperidol. Document the reason for withholding the medication and the communication with the provider."
    },
    "row4_col1": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "An elevated lactate level is an anticipated finding after cardiac arrest. During cardiac arrest, systemic hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism occur due to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. This leads to increased production of lactic acid, resulting in elevated lactate levels. While it needs to be monitored and trended downwards with treatment, it is an expected consequence and not the most immediate life-threatening priority compared to the active arrhythmia risks. Serial lactate measurements help assess the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts and tissue perfusion.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Elevated lactate levels are common post-ROSC due to tissue hypoperfusion. Monitor trends to assess resuscitation effectiveness. A persistently elevated or rising lactate level may indicate ongoing tissue hypoxia or inadequate perfusion."
    },
    "row5_col1": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Post-cardiac arrest shock with hypotension is a very common and anticipated complication. Following ROSC, the client often experiences myocardial dysfunction (stunned myocardium) and systemic vasodilation due to the inflammatory response and reperfusion injury. This leads to decreased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular resistance, resulting in hypotension. The client's MAP is >65 mmHg, and an appropriate intervention (Norepinephrine infusion) is already in place and actively being titrated. Therefore, this blood pressure is an anticipated finding under current treatment, not a new crisis requiring a separate immediate action.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hypotension is common post-ROSC. Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors to ensure adequate organ perfusion. Monitor for signs of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., decreased urine output, altered mental status) despite adequate MAP."
    },
    "incorrectOptions": {
      "row1_col1": "Incorrect. A critically low magnesium level is a life-threatening emergency, not an expected finding.",
      "row1_col2": "Incorrect. This is an urgent, critical lab value that requires immediate intervention, not non-urgent monitoring.",
      "row2_col1": "Incorrect. A QTc of 560 ms is a dangerous abnormality, not an anticipated finding post-ROSC, and indicates extreme electrical instability.",
      "row2_col2": "Incorrect. This ECG finding represents a high risk for imminent lethal arrhythmia and is therefore urgent and requires immediate action.",
      "row3_col1": "Incorrect. While the order is in the MAR, it is not an 'anticipated' action because it is dangerously contraindicated. The nurse's role is to recognize this error, not anticipate carrying it out.",
      "row3_col2": "Incorrect. This order is not non-urgent; it is a critical safety threat that requires the nurse to take immediate action to prevent harm by questioning the order.",
      "row4_col2": "Incorrect. While important for long-term prognosis, an elevated lactate is not a non-urgent finding; it is an anticipated part of the acute post-arrest pathophysiology.",
      "row4_col3": "Incorrect. Although high, the lactate level itself does not require an independent nursing action as immediate as addressing the electrolyte and ECG abnormalities that could cause another arrest within minutes.",
      "row5_col2": "Incorrect. The blood pressure is being actively managed and is within the target MAP goal, making it part of the acute, ongoing plan rather than a non-urgent issue.",
      "row5_col3": "Incorrect. Immediate action is not required for this specific BP reading because an appropriate intervention (vasopressor) is already in place and is effective at meeting the prescribed MAP goal."
