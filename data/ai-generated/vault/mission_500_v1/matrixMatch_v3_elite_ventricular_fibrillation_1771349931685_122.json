He was brought to the emergency department by ambulance after being found unresponsive at home. Per EMS, bystander CPR was in progress. Initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. The client was defibrillated once, received epinephrine and amiodarone, and achieved ROSC. Client is now intubated, sedated with a propofol infusion, and being prepared for transfer to the ICU. Wife at bedside states the client has had 'trouble affording his water pills' (furosemide) for the last few months and has been more swollen."
