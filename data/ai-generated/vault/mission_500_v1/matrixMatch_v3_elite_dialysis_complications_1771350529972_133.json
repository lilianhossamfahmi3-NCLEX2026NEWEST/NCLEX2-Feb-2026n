He has a new tunneled right internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) placed 2 weeks ago for hemodialysis access. He reports missing several appointments for AV fistula evaluation due to 'trouble getting rides.' This is his third hemodialysis session. At the start of the session, the client was talkative, and vital signs were stable. CVC dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Blood return from both ports was brisk. No signs of infection noted."
