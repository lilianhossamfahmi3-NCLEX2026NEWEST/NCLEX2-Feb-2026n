He has a new tunneled right internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) placed 2 weeks ago for hemodialysis access. He reports missing several appointments for AV fistula evaluation due to 'trouble getting rides.' This is his third hemodialysis session. At the start of the session, the client was talkative, and vital signs were stable. CVC dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Blood return from both ports was brisk. No signs of infection noted."

The absolute first priority is to prevent any more air from entering the venous circulation. Clamping the venous line and stopping the blood pump is the critical 'STOP' action. This prevents further air entry into the client's circulation. The pathophysiology of a venous air embolism involves air entering the venous system and traveling to the right side of the heart. From there, it can obstruct pulmonary blood flow, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypoxemia. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always suspect air embolism with sudden respiratory distress during central line procedures or dialysis. Rapid intervention is crucial.\n"

Placing the client on their left side (left lateral decubitus) and in Trendelenburg position is intended to trap the air in the apex of the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary artery and causing a fatal obstructive shock. This position helps to keep the air bubble localized and away from the pulmonary valve, minimizing obstruction. The Trendelenburg position increases venous return to the heart, which can help to improve cardiac output. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Remember 'left-side down' for air embolism. This position is crucial for preventing further complications.\n"

The ECG confirms acute right ventricular strain. Administering a fluid bolus would increase preload and further strain the failing right ventricle, potentially worsening the client's hemodynamic collapse. In venous air embolism, the primary problem is obstruction of blood flow to the lungs, not a lack of circulating volume. Increasing preload can exacerbate right ventricular dysfunction. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Avoid fluid boluses in suspected air embolism unless there is clear evidence of hypovolemia from another cause.\n"

Administering 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is a critical intervention to maximize oxygenation, support vital organs, and help reduce the size of the nitrogen bubbles in the air embolus. High-flow oxygen helps to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, which can improve oxygen delivery to tissues. It also helps to reduce the size of the nitrogen bubbles in the air embolus by creating a concentration gradient that favors the diffusion of nitrogen out of the bubbles. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** High-flow oxygen is a cornerstone of air embolism management. Ensure a tight seal with the non-rebreather mask.\n"

A venous air embolism is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate advanced care, including potential central line aspiration of the air and advanced hemodynamic support. Activating the RRT and notifying the primary provider (nephrologist) are essential actions to be taken concurrently with initial life-saving measures. The RRT can provide advanced airway management, hemodynamic monitoring, and other critical interventions. The nephrologist can provide expertise in managing dialysis-related complications. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Air embolism requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early activation of the RRT is essential.\n"

Continuing to run the blood pump, even at a lower rate, risks introducing more air into the client's circulation, which would be fatal. The treatment must be terminated immediately. The dialysis circuit is the likely source of the air embolism, and continuing the procedure will only exacerbate the problem. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Immediately stop dialysis if air embolism is suspected. Do not attempt to troubleshoot the circuit until the client is stabilized.\n"
