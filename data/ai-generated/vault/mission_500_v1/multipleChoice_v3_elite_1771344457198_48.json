        "correct": "The core nursing responsibility before administering a high-risk medication like alteplase is to screen for absolute contraindications. Significant head trauma within the past 3 months is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. The patient's report of hitting their head, 'seeing stars,' and having a persistent headache, even without loss of consciousness, represents a significant head injury. Administering alteplase could convert a small, undiagnosed intracranial contusion or bleed into a life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. This finding creates a 'SAFETY STOP' situation, where the nurse must withhold the drug and immediately communicate this critical information to the provider. The other findings are either indications for the therapy or expected baseline values.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent findings that are either expected with a massive PE or are indications *for* the prescribed therapy, not against it. Choosing any of these options demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical safety contraindication and prioritizes signs of the disease over the risks of the treatment.",

                "justification": "This is the correct answer. Any significant head trauma or prior stroke within 3 months is an absolute contraindication for alteplase due to the unacceptably high risk of causing or worsening an intracranial hemorrhage. The client's report, though seemingly minor to them, is a critical finding that mandates withholding the drug. This is a classic 'Don't Proceed' safety check."

                "justification": "This finding, along with worsening tachycardia and tachypnea, indicates hemodynamic instability. This is the primary *indication* for administering thrombolytic therapy in a massive PE, as it signifies that the right ventricle is failing against the high pressure caused by the clot. Withholding the drug based on this finding would allow the client to progress into obstructive shock and cardiovascular collapse."

                "justification": "An elevated troponin in the context of a PE is an expected finding that reflects right ventricular strain and myocardial injury due to acute pressure overload. This is a marker of a submassive or massive PE and strengthens the indication for aggressive therapy like thrombolysis. It is a reason to proceed, not to stop."

An abnormally prolonged baseline aPTT would be a cause for concern and a relative contraindication, but a normal value is reassuring and allows the nurse to proceed with the planned therapy, assuming no other contraindications exist."
