    "correct": "The core nursing responsibility before administering a high-risk medication like alteplase is to screen for absolute contraindications. Significant head trauma within the past 3 months is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy due to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's report of hitting their head, 'seeing stars,' and having a persistent headache, even without loss of consciousness, represents a potential head injury. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. This fibrinolytic action is not specific to the pulmonary embolism and can dissolve clots throughout the body, including those that may be forming to stabilize a damaged blood vessel in the brain after a head injury. Administering alteplase could convert a small, undiagnosed intracranial contusion or bleed into a life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. This finding creates a 'SAFETY STOP' situation, where the nurse must withhold the drug and immediately communicate this critical information to the provider. The other findings are either indications for the therapy or expected baseline values.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent findings that are either expected with a massive PE or are indications *for* the prescribed therapy, not against it. Choosing any of these options demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical safety contraindication and prioritizes signs of the disease over the risks of the treatment.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the correct answer. Any significant head trauma or prior stroke within 3 months is an absolute contraindication for alteplase due to the unacceptably high risk of causing or worsening an intracranial hemorrhage. The client's report, though seemingly minor to them, is a critical finding that mandates withholding the drug. This is a classic 'Don't Proceed' safety check. The mechanism behind this contraindication lies in alteplase's systemic fibrinolytic activity. Even a minor head injury can cause small vessel damage and micro-bleeds in the brain. The body's natural response is to form clots to stop the bleeding. Alteplase would dissolve these clots, potentially leading to a larger, more dangerous hemorrhage."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This finding, along with worsening tachycardia and tachypnea, indicates hemodynamic instability. This is the primary *indication* for administering thrombolytic therapy in a massive PE, as it signifies that the right ventricle is failing against the high pressure caused by the clot. The massive PE obstructs blood flow to the lungs, increasing pulmonary artery pressure. The right ventricle must work harder to pump blood against this increased pressure, leading to right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. This can result in decreased cardiac output and systemic hypotension. Withholding the drug based on this finding would allow the client to progress into obstructive shock and cardiovascular collapse."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "An elevated troponin in the context of a PE is an expected finding that reflects right ventricular strain and myocardial injury due to acute pressure overload. This is a marker of a submassive or massive PE and strengthens the indication for aggressive therapy like thrombolysis. It is a reason to proceed, not to stop. The elevated troponin indicates that the right ventricle is experiencing ischemia and damage due to the increased workload and decreased oxygen supply. The increased pulmonary artery pressure from the PE causes right ventricular wall tension to increase, leading to increased myocardial oxygen demand. If oxygen supply cannot meet demand, myocardial injury occurs, releasing troponin into the bloodstream."

        "content": "An activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 32 seconds.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This aPTT is within the normal reference range. A normal baseline coagulation profile is a prerequisite for safely administering anticoagulants or thrombolytics. An abnormally prolonged baseline aPTT would be a cause for concern and a relative contraindication, but a normal value is reassuring and allows the nurse to proceed with the planned therapy, assuming no other contraindications exist. The aPTT measures the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. A prolonged aPTT could indicate an underlying bleeding disorder or the effects of anticoagulation, which would increase the risk of hemorrhage with alteplase."

I recommend the provider be notified immediately to discuss alternative treatment options due to the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A CT scan of the head may be warranted to rule out any acute bleeding before proceeding with any thrombolytic therapy."
