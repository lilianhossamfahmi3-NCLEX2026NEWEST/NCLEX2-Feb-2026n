The nurse's immediate priorities are to address the life-threatening hypoxemia and facilitate escalation of care. This involves maximizing oxygen delivery (non-rebreather mask), optimizing ventilation/perfusion (high-Fowler's position), and preparing for ICU transfer for advanced monitoring and potential intubation. Actions that could worsen the client's condition, such as administering a respiratory depressant (morphine) or an anticoagulant in the setting of thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin), are contraindicated and represent critical safety stops.",
