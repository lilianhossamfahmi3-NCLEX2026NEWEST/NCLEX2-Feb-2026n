        "correct": "The client is experiencing Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency common in clients with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury, leading to an imbalanced sympathetic nervous system response. This causes severe hypertension, which can lead to stroke, seizure, or death. The immediate nursing priorities are to lower the blood pressure and remove the triggering stimulus. The correct actions address these priorities simultaneously: (A) Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension, helping to lower blood pressure. (C) Loosening restrictive clothing or binders removes a potential stimulus. (B) Administering a rapid-acting IV antihypertensive like hydralazine is critical to manage the malignant hypertension and prevent central nervous system complications. (E) The bladder scan confirms severe urinary retention (825 mL), which is the most common cause of AD. Immediate catheterization is required to remove this stimulus.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent significant safety risks or delays in care. (D) Sublingual nifedipine is no longer recommended for hypertensive crises due to its potential to cause a rapid, unpredictable drop in blood pressure, leading to cerebral ischemia and rebound tachycardia. (F) Administering metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is extremely dangerous. The bradycardia (HR 46) is a compensatory response from the vagus nerve trying to lower the dangerously high blood pressure. Blocking this response would lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening the hypertension. (G) While AD can cause ECG changes, managing the blood pressure is the immediate life-saving priority; obtaining an ECG would delay critical interventions. (H) AD is a nursing emergency that requires immediate, independent nursing actions based on established protocols. Waiting for a provider would be a critical delay and constitutes negligence.",
