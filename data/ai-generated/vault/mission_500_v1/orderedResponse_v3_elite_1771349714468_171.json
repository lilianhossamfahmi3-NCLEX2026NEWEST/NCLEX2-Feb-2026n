        "incorrect": "Any other order of actions introduces significant risk. Administering Calcium Gluconate would be a fatal error. Delaying cardiac monitoring prevents assessment of life-threatening arrhythmias. Delaying the Digoxin Immune Fab fails to treat the root cause of the cardiotoxicity.

Continuous monitoring is essential for immediate detection of rhythm changes and to assess the effectiveness of interventions. This is a foundational safety action."

The nurse must synthesize the client's report of seeing 'halos', the bradycardia, the AV block, the 'scooped' ST segments, and the toxic digoxin level to identify digoxin toxicity. Administering IV calcium to a patient with digoxin toxicity is absolutely contraindicated as it can potentiate digoxin's effects on the myocardium, leading to a fatal arrhythmia or asystole (often called 'stone heart'). Recognizing this contraindication is the most important clinical judgment in this scenario."

                "reason": "After ensuring monitoring is in place and recognizing the contraindication, the next priority is to administer the antidote for the digoxin toxicity. The toxicity is the primary driver of the severe bradycardia and AV block, and reversing it is paramount to stabilizing the client's cardiac status. Treating the toxicity will also help facilitate the subsequent management of hyperkalemia."

                "reason": "Once the digoxin toxicity is being addressed, the life-threatening hyperkalemia must be treated. IV insulin and dextrose work rapidly (within minutes) to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, temporarily lowering the serum potassium level and mitigating its effect on cardiac conduction. This is the fastest-acting intervention specifically for hyperkalemia."

                "reason": "This is the final priority. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a potassium-binding resin that works in the gastrointestinal tract to actually remove potassium from the body. However, its onset of action is slow (hours). It is an important part of the overall treatment plan but is not an emergency intervention for immediate cardiac stabilization."
