Client states, 'I'm excited to try this new medicine, the joint pain has been unbearable.' Client reports living in a rural area, a 2.5-hour drive from the clinic. Baseline assessment is within normal limits. IV access established, and infusion started as ordered.\n\n1015: Client uses the call light. Reports 'sudden, intense itching' on chest and back, and a 'lump in my throat.' Client appears anxious and is flushed. Skin is warm and diaphoretic."

                "anaphylactic shock": "Correct. This is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. The client's presentation is classic: exposure to a new antigen (PsoriVantiv) followed by rapid onset of cutaneous (itching, flushing), respiratory (lump in throat, suggesting angioedema), and cardiovascular (severe hypotension, compensatory tachycardia, hypoxia) symptoms.",
                "a vasovagal response": "Incorrect. A vasovagal response typically presents with bradycardia and pallor, not tachycardia, flushing, itching, and respiratory distress.",
                "septic shock": "Incorrect. Septic shock develops from an infection. The onset is typically not as instantaneous as this client's reaction, which occurred minutes after starting a new medication. There are no other signs of infection (e.g., fever)."

            "rationales": {
                "acute onset of hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia": "Correct. These vital sign changes are the objective evidence of distributive shock. The drop in BP from 138/86 to 90/52, increase in HR from 76 to 128, and fall in SpO2 from 98% to 91% are life-threatening indicators of cardiovascular and respiratory collapse.",
                "client's report of anxiety and flushing": "Incorrect. While these are common symptoms of anaphylaxis, they are not the primary indicators of shock. The hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia) is the most critical cue defining the life-threatening nature of the event.",
                "normal ECG findings aside from tachycardia": "Incorrect. The ECG simply confirms the compensatory sinus tachycardia; it does not identify the underlying cause of the shock state. It primarily rules out a primary cardiac event like an MI."

        },
        "3": {
            "correct": "stop the PsoriVantiv infusion",
            "rationales": {
                "stop the PsoriVantiv infusion": "Correct. The absolute first priority in treating an infusion-related anaphylactic reaction is to stop the administration of the causative agent immediately. This prevents more of the antigen from entering the client's system and worsening the reaction.",
                "administer the scheduled metoprolol": "Incorrect. This is a critical safety stop. Administering a beta-blocker (metoprolol) during anaphylactic shock is contraindicated and potentially lethal. It would worsen the hypotension and blunt the body's compensatory tachycardia. Crucially, it would also block the therapeutic effects of epinephrine, the first-line treatment.",
                "place the client in a high-Fowler's position": "Incorrect. While this position can help with work of breathing, it is contraindicated in a hypotensive state as it can worsen hypotension by causing blood to pool in the lower extremities. The client should be placed supine, with legs elevated, to promote venous return to the heart."

        "4": {
            "correct": "intramuscular epinephrine",
            "rationales": {
                "intramuscular epinephrine": "Correct. Epinephrine is the first-line, life-saving medication for anaphylaxis. It acts rapidly to cause vasoconstriction (increasing BP), reduce mucosal edema (relieving the 'lump in throat'), and cause bronchodilation. It must be administered as soon as anaphylaxis is recognized.",
                "an intravenous fluid bolus": "Incorrect. While IV fluids are a critical secondary intervention to treat the relative hypovolemia from vasodilation, epinephrine is the immediate priority to reverse the pathophysiology of the reaction. Fluid resuscitation should be initiated concurrently or immediately after epinephrine.",
                "oral diphenhydramine": "Incorrect. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine are second-line treatments. They help manage cutaneous symptoms like itching and hives but do nothing to correct the life-threatening hypotension, bronchoconstriction, or laryngeal edema. They also have a much slower onset of action compared to IM epinephrine."
