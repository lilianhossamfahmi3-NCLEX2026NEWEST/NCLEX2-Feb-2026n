    "correct": "The correct action is to withhold the ordered PEEP increase and immediately notify the provider about the client's new hemodynamic instability. The client's vital signs at 0800 show a sudden drop in blood pressure to 84/48 mmHg and a significant rise in heart rate to 128 bpm. This clinical picture, in the context of high intrathoracic pressure from mechanical ventilation (PEEP 14 cm H2O, rising PIP to 36 cm H2O), strongly suggests cardiovascular compromise. High levels of PEEP increase intrathoracic pressure, which can impede venous return to the right side of the heart, decreasing preload and ultimately reducing cardiac output, leading to hypotension and compensatory tachycardia. In ARDS, the lungs are already stiff and non-compliant, requiring higher pressures to ventilate. Increasing the PEEP further to 18 cm H2O as ordered would likely exacerbate this effect and could precipitate cardiovascular collapse. This is a critical safety stop moment where the nurse must recognize the contraindication and communicate the change in status before proceeding.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices fail to address the immediate life-threatening risk. Proceeding with the PEEP increase is dangerous and directly contraindicated by the new hypotension. Administering a fluid bolus without an order is outside the scope of practice and may worsen pulmonary edema in ARDS. Requesting another vasopressor might be a subsequent step, but the primary, independent nursing action is to first withhold the dangerous intervention and communicate the change. The rationales for the second dropdown are incorrect because while hypoxemia is present, the most acute change is hemodynamic. Ventilator dyssynchrony and inadequate sedation are not supported by the data as the client is chemically paralyzed.",
