The AKI has led to severe hyperkalemia (Potassium 7.1 mEq/L). This critical electrolyte imbalance is causing cardiotoxicity, confirmed by the ECG showing classic signs: tall, peaked T-waves and a widened QRS complex. This pattern indicates myocardial instability and is a precursor to ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The nurse's immediate priority is to prevent further harm and initiate corrective measures. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated because it can worsen hyperkalemia by inhibiting aldosterone secretion, which is needed for potassium excretion. It would also exacerbate the client's current hypotension (95/52 mmHg). Therefore, the only safe action is to withhold the medication and immediately escalate care by notifying the provider of the critical lab value and life-threatening ECG changes.",

Administering an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) in a client with AKI, severe hyperkalemia, and hypotension is contraindicated. ACE inhibitors impair potassium excretion and will worsen the life-threatening hyperkalemia. Furthermore, its antihypertensive effect will worsen the client's already low blood pressure (95/52 mmHg), further compromising renal perfusion."

The risk of cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia-induced dysrhythmias is the top priority. Fluid administration is a necessary intervention but is secondary to stabilizing the myocardium and correcting the severe hyperkalemia."

It addresses two critical safety principles: first, preventing a medication error by withholding a contraindicated drug, and second, escalating care for a life-threatening condition. Immediate provider notification is required to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., IV calcium gluconate to stabilize the myocardium, followed by IV insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly)."

                "justification": "This action is appropriate and necessary, but it is incomplete and not the highest priority. Simply monitoring and documenting does not address the root cause or prevent the impending cardiac arrest. The client is already showing significant ECG changes. The priority action must involve both preventing further harm (withholding the lisinopril) and initiating the process for corrective treatment by notifying the provider. This option delays critical intervention."
