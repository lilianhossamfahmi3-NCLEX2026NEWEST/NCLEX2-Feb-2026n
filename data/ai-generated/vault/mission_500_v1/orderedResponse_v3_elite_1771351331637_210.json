This is a life-threatening iatrogenic complication of DKA treatment, caused by a rapid decrease in serum osmolality from aggressive fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. This osmotic shift drives water into brain cells. The absolute priority is to immediately stop the primary cause of the fluid shift, which is the insulin infusion. Subsequent actions focus on reducing ICP, summoning immediate advanced help, and preparing for emergency medical interventions.",
