The nurse is reviewing the electronic health record (EHR) in preparation for implementing newly received orders.",

The trend of increasing systolic blood pressure (hypertension), decreasing heart rate (bradycardia), and irregular, slowed respirations (bradypnea) constitutes Cushing's triad.

In this client with a right-sided epidural hematoma, it indicates herniation of the temporal lobe (uncal herniation), which is compressing the nerve. This is a neurological emergency and is consistent with the diagnosis."

A shift greater than 5 mm is considered severe and indicative of high intracranial pressure with a significant risk of herniation. An 8 mm shift is a critical finding consistent with the client's neurological decline."

While electrolyte imbalances can affect neurological function, this normal value is not directly related to the pathophysiology of IICP or brain herniation. It is an unrelated finding."

                "rationale": "CORRECT. This finding is inconsistent with the principles of safe care for a client with IICP. D5W is an isotonic solution in the bag but becomes hypotonic once administered because the body rapidly metabolizes the dextrose. The remaining free water would shift from the intravascular space into the brain cells, acutely worsening cerebral edema and accelerating herniation. This order is a life-threatening contraindication and represents a 'SAFETY STOP' moment for the nurse, who must question and clarify this order immediately. Administering this fluid would be a catastrophic error."

A decrease from 13 (indicating a moderate injury/alteration) to 9 (indicating a severe injury) is a significant neurological decline. This drop is a hallmark of worsening IICP and is highly consistent with the client's progression towards brain herniation."
