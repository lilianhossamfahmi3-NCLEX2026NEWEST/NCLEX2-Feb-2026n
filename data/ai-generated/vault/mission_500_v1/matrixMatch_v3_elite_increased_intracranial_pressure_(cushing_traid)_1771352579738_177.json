        "rationale": "CORRECT. The trend of increasing systolic blood pressure (hypertension), decreasing heart rate (bradycardia), and irregular, slowed respirations (bradypnea) constitutes Cushing's triad. This is a late, ominous sign of significantly increased intracranial pressure (IICP) and impending brain herniation. The increased systolic BP is the body's attempt to perfuse the brain against rising ICP. Bradycardia is a reflex response to hypertension mediated by the vagus nerve. Irregular respirations result from pressure on the brainstem. This finding is highly consistent with the client's condition."

        "rationale": "CORRECT. A unilateral fixed and dilated pupil (anisocoria) is a classic sign of cranial nerve III (oculomotor) compression. In this client with a right-sided epidural hematoma, it indicates herniation of the temporal lobe (uncal herniation), which is compressing the nerve. The oculomotor nerve controls pupillary constriction; compression impairs this function, leading to dilation. This is a neurological emergency and is consistent with the diagnosis."

        "column": "col1",
        "rationale": "CORRECT. A midline shift on a Head CT scan is a direct measurement of the displacement of brain structures due to mass effect from a lesion like a hematoma. The hematoma expands within the skull, pushing brain tissue across the midline. A shift greater than 5 mm is considered severe and indicative of high intracranial pressure with a significant risk of herniation. An 8 mm shift is a critical finding consistent with the client's neurological decline."

        "rationale": "CORRECT. A serum potassium level of 3.9 mmol/L is within the normal range (typically 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). While electrolyte imbalances can affect neurological function, this normal value is not directly related to the pathophysiology of IICP or brain herniation. It is an unrelated finding. The body's compensatory mechanisms for IICP do not directly impact potassium levels."

        "row": "row5",
        "column": "col2",
        "rationale": "CORRECT. This finding is inconsistent with the principles of safe care for a client with IICP. D5W is an isotonic solution in the bag but becomes hypotonic once administered because the body rapidly metabolizes the dextrose. The remaining free water would shift from the intravascular space into the brain cells via osmosis, acutely worsening cerebral edema and accelerating herniation. Increased cerebral edema further elevates ICP. This order is a life-threatening contraindication and represents a 'SAFETY STOP' moment for the nurse, who must question and clarify this order immediately. Administering this fluid would be a catastrophic error."

        "rationale": "CORRECT. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a standardized tool to assess level of consciousness. A decrease from 13 (indicating a moderate injury/alteration) to 9 (indicating a severe injury) is a significant neurological decline. This drop is a hallmark of worsening IICP and is highly consistent with the client's progression towards brain herniation. As ICP increases, it impairs cerebral perfusion and neuronal function, leading to a decreased level of consciousness."
