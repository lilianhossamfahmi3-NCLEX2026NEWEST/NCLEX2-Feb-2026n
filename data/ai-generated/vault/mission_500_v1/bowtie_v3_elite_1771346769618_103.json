    "correct": "The client's presentation (oliguria, lethargy, recent contrast dye exposure, critically high K+ and creatinine, and ECG changes) indicates cardiotoxicity from severe hyperkalemia caused by contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Peaked T-waves and widened QRS complex are signs of impending ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The priority is to stabilize the myocardium with IV Calcium Gluconate. Next, rapidly lower serum potassium by shifting it intracellularly with IV Insulin and Dextrose. Cardiac telemetry monitors intervention effectiveness and detects arrhythmias. Hourly urine output assesses AKI progression.",
    "incorrect": "Prioritizing fluid removal (Furosemide) or slower-acting potassium binders (Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate) before stabilizing the heart is incorrect. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is contraindicated and worsens hyperkalemia. Other options are relevant but don't address the immediate cardiac risk.",
