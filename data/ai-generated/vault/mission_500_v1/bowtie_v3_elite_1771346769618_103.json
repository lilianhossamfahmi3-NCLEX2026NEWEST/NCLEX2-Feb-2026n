The peaked T-waves and widened QRS complex are ominous signs of impending ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The absolute first priority is to stabilize the myocardium to prevent cardiac arrest. This is achieved by administering IV Calcium Gluconate. The second immediate priority is to rapidly lower the serum potassium by shifting it into the cells, which is accomplished with IV Insulin and Dextrose. Monitoring cardiac telemetry is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and detect arrhythmias. Monitoring urine output is crucial for assessing the progression of the AKI.",
        "incorrect": "Focusing on fluid removal (Furosemide) or slower-acting potassium binders (Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate) before stabilizing the heart is a fatal error in prioritization. Administering Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is a critical contraindication that would worsen the hyperkalemia and could precipitate cardiac arrest. This is a classic 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' scenario. The other options are relevant to the client's overall condition but do not address the immediate, life-threatening cardiac risk.",
