        "row2": {
            "col3": "Correct. While iodine solutions like Lugol's are used in thyroid storm to block the release of pre-formed thyroid hormone, they are **contraindicated** until at least one hour *after* an antithyroid medication (like methimazole) has been given. Administering iodine first can provide more substrate for the thyroid gland to produce even more hormone, paradoxically worsening the storm. The order to give both STAT is a sequencing error the nurse must identify."

        "row3": {
            "col1": "Correct. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is essential to control the severe cardiovascular symptoms of thyroid storm, including the extreme tachycardia (RVR of 160-170s), palpitations, and tremor. It helps prevent cardiovascular collapse and controls heart rate."

        "row4": {
            "col3": "Correct. This is a critical safety stop. Aspirin (salicylates) is **contraindicated** in thyroid storm because it displaces T4 and T3 from thyroid-binding globulin, which increases the levels of free, active thyroid hormone in the bloodstream, acutely worsening the thyrotoxicosis and potentially leading to death."

            "col1": "Correct. Extreme hyperthermia (40.1°C / 104.2°F) is a life-threatening component of thyroid storm that can lead to CNS damage and cardiovascular collapse. Aggressive cooling measures, including cooling blankets and a non-salicylate antipyretic like IV acetaminophen, are essential to lower the client's temperature."

        "row6": {
            "col2": "Correct. The client's inability to afford medication is the likely root cause of this crisis and a significant social determinant of health. A social worker referral is important for discharge planning and preventing recurrence. However, during an acute, life-threatening crisis, this action is non-essential compared to immediate medical and nursing interventions."
