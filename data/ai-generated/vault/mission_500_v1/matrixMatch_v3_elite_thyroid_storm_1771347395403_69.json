  "answerBreakdown": {
    "row1": {
      "col1": "Correct. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication (thionamide) that inhibits thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). By blocking this enzyme, methimazole prevents the iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, thus reducing the production of new thyroid hormone. This action is essential in thyroid storm to decrease the excessive levels of T3 and T4 contributing to the hypermetabolic state."
    },
    "row2": {
      "col3": "Correct. Lugol's solution (iodine) inhibits the release of preformed thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. However, administering iodine *before* an antithyroid medication like methimazole can paradoxically worsen the storm. The excess iodine can be used by the already overactive thyroid gland to synthesize even more thyroid hormone. Therefore, it is **contraindicated** to administer Lugol's solution before methimazole. The nurse must clarify the order with the provider."
    },
    "row3": {
      "col1": "Correct. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, is essential for managing the adrenergic symptoms of thyroid storm. Thyroid hormone increases the sensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to exaggerated responses to catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). Propranolol blocks these receptors, reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and tremor. It also partially inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3, further reducing thyroid hormone activity."
    },
    "row4": {
      "col3": "Correct. Aspirin is **contraindicated** in thyroid storm due to its ability to displace thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) from thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). TBG is the primary transport protein for thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. When aspirin displaces T4 and T3, it increases the concentration of free (unbound) thyroid hormones, which are the biologically active forms. This acute increase in free thyroid hormone levels can exacerbate the hyperthyroidism and worsen the thyroid storm, potentially leading to fatal complications."
    },
    "row5": {
      "col1": "Correct. The client's temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F) indicates severe hyperthermia, a life-threatening complication of thyroid storm. Elevated thyroid hormone levels increase the basal metabolic rate, leading to increased heat production. Aggressive cooling measures, such as a cooling blanket and IV acetaminophen, are essential to reduce the client's temperature and prevent complications like CNS damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. Acetaminophen is preferred over aspirin as aspirin can worsen the thyroid storm."
    },
    "row6": {
      "col2": "Correct. While addressing the client's inability to afford thyroid medication is important for long-term management and preventing future episodes, it is **non-essential** during the acute, life-threatening thyroid storm. The immediate priority is to stabilize the client's physiological condition by administering medications, controlling hyperthermia, and managing cardiovascular symptoms. A social worker referral should be initiated once the client is stable."
