The critical potassium level of 2.6 mEq/L is the root cause of the ventricular irritability seen on the ECG (PVCs, NSVT). The aggressive diuresis (1.5 L output) has caused both hypovolemia (evidenced by hypotension to 84/52 mmHg and tachycardia to 138/min) and severe hypokalemia. Administering another dose of furosemide, a potent potassium-wasting diuretic, would be a life-threatening error. It would exacerbate the hypokalemia, likely precipitating sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and worsen the hypovolemia, leading to cardiovascular collapse. The only safe action is to withhold the medication, contact the provider immediately with the critical lab and ECG findings, and anticipate orders for aggressive IV potassium replacement.",

Administering more furosemide is directly contraindicated and could be fatal. Increasing IV fluids without addressing the arrhythmia and critical potassium is inappropriate and potentially harmful in a patient with underlying severe heart failure. Administering a vasodilator like hydralazine to a patient with a BP of 84/52 would cause catastrophic hypotension.",
