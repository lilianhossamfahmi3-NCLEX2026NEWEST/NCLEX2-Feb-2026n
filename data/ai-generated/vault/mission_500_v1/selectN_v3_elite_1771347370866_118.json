Norepinephrine will increase blood pressure and improve organ perfusion. Sodium bicarbonate will help correct the metabolic acidosis and temporarily shift potassium intracellularly.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either pose a direct and immediate threat to the client's life or fail to address the highest priority problems of severe hyperkalemia and distributive shock.

        "content": "Administer the prescribed succinylcholine to improve oxygenation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can cause a transient increase in serum potassium. In a client with hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L), this could induce a fatal arrhythmia. The pathophysiology involves succinylcholine binding to acetylcholine receptors, causing depolarization and efflux of potassium from muscle cells. This is especially dangerous in patients with CKD, who already have impaired potassium excretion. Clinical Pearl: Always check potassium levels before administering succinylcholine, especially in patients with renal dysfunction or a history of hyperkalemia."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. The client's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L is critically high. Succinylcholine can cause a further increase in serum potassium, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The nurse's role as a patient advocate requires questioning orders that could harm the patient. The pathophysiology behind this contraindication lies in succinylcholine's mechanism of action, which causes potassium efflux from muscle cells. Clinical Pearl: Hyperkalemia is an absolute contraindication for succinylcholine administration. Always prioritize patient safety by questioning potentially harmful orders. "

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Initiate the norepinephrine infusion.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. The client's blood pressure is trending downward (110/70 to 88/50), indicating shock. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that increases blood pressure by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction. The high lactate level (5.2 mmol/L) suggests tissue hypoperfusion, further supporting the need for vasopressor support. The pathophysiology involves the body's compensatory mechanisms failing to maintain adequate perfusion after cardiac arrest, leading to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production. Clinical Pearl: Early initiation of vasopressors is crucial in post-ROSC care to maintain adequate organ perfusion and prevent secondary ischemic injury. Aim for a MAP > 65 mmHg."

        "content": "Administer the sodium bicarbonate IV push.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. The client's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.20 and HCO3 of 18 mEq/L, indicating metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate helps to buffer the excess acid in the bloodstream, raising the pH. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate can temporarily shift potassium intracellularly, helping to stabilize the cardiac membrane in the setting of hyperkalemia. The pathophysiology involves the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic metabolites due to tissue hypoperfusion and impaired cellular metabolism post-arrest. Clinical Pearl: Sodium bicarbonate is indicated in severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2) and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. Monitor ABGs closely to assess the response to treatment."

        "label": "E",
        "content": "Prepare equipment for targeted temperature management.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. While targeted temperature management (TTM) is a standard of care for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, it is not the most immediate priority. Stabilizing the client's hemodynamics (shock) and correcting life-threatening electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia) must occur first. TTM can be initiated once the client is stabilized. The pathophysiology behind TTM involves reducing cerebral metabolic rate and preventing secondary brain injury by mitigating the effects of ischemia and reperfusion. Clinical Pearl: Initiate TTM after addressing immediate life threats such as shock and electrolyte imbalances. The goal is to maintain a target temperature of 32-36°C for 24 hours."

        "content": "Administer the amiodarone infusion over 10 minutes.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. Although amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication, the client's current ECG changes (peaked T waves, wide QRS) are characteristic of severe hyperkalemia, not a primary arrhythmia that amiodarone would correct. The immediate priorities are treating the underlying causes: shock and hyperkalemia. Administering amiodarone does not address these root problems and delays life-saving interventions. The pathophysiology involves the disruption of normal cardiac conduction due to electrolyte imbalances, leading to abnormal ECG findings. Clinical Pearl: Always identify and treat the underlying cause of arrhythmias. In this case, hyperkalemia is the primary driver of the ECG changes, not an intrinsic arrhythmia requiring amiodarone."
