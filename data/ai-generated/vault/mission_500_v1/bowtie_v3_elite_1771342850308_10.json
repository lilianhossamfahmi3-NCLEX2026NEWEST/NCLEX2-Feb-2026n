This is confirmed by the clinical triad of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. The most immediate life-threatening problem is severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L), which is causing cardiotoxicity as evidenced by peaked T-waves and a widened QRS on the ECG. This places the client at imminent risk for cardiac arrest. Therefore, the nurse must take immediate actions to: 1) Stabilize the cardiac membrane (calcium gluconate), 2) Treat the underlying cause by replacing glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone), and 3) Restore volume and correct hypoglycemia/hyponatremia (D5% in 0.9% NaCl). Monitoring must focus on the immediate threats: cardiac rhythm (ECG), the effectiveness of hyperkalemia treatment (serum potassium), and reversal of shock (blood pressure).",
        "incorrect": "Selecting incorrect options demonstrates a failure to recognize the most critical and life-threatening aspects of the client's condition, potentially leading to a fatal outcome. Administering spironolactone is a catastrophic error as it is a potassium-sparing diuretic that would worsen the already life-threatening hyperkalemia. Delaying cardioprotective measures (calcium gluconate) or hemodynamic support (fluids, steroids) to pursue less urgent interventions is unsafe. While septic shock presents with hypotension and tachycardia, the specific combination of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia in a client with Addison's disease points directly to adrenal crisis. Monitoring parameters like urine specific gravity or pupillary response are not priorities when facing imminent cardiovascular collapse.",
