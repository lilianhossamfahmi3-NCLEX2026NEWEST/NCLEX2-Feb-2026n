    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition. Key findings include sudden respiratory distress (gasping for air), tracheal deviation to the left, absent breath sounds on the right, subcutaneous emphysema, cessation of chest tube tidaling, and worsening vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, hypercapnia). A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This pressure compresses the lung, shifts mediastinal structures (tracheal deviation), and impairs venous return, causing obstructive shock. The ABG confirms acute respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. Immediate actions are crucial to relieve the pressure and restore oxygenation and ventilation. The nurse must act swiftly, considering the client's limited English proficiency and relying on objective assessment data.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions would delay treatment, worsen the client's condition, or are contraindicated. These actions demonstrate a failure to recognize the severity and pathophysiology of a tension pneumothorax.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "**Incorrect.** Administering morphine is contraindicated. The client's agitation is due to severe hypoxia, not pain or anxiety. Morphine, an opioid, can depress the respiratory drive, further decreasing respiratory rate and tidal volume, worsening hypercapnia and hypoxemia. This could lead to respiratory arrest. **Clinical Pearl:** Agitation in a patient with respiratory distress is often a sign of worsening hypoxia and should prompt immediate assessment of oxygenation and ventilation, not sedation. **Pathophysiology:** Opioids bind to receptors in the brainstem, reducing the sensitivity to carbon dioxide and decreasing the drive to breathe. In a patient already struggling to breathe due to a tension pneumothorax, this can be fatal. **+/- Scoring: -**"

A tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention by a multidisciplinary team with advanced skills and resources. The RRT can provide advanced airway management, administer medications, and prepare for procedures like needle decompression or chest tube reinsertion. **Clinical Pearl:** Early activation of the RRT can improve patient outcomes in critical situations by bringing expert help to the bedside quickly. **Pathophysiology:** The RRT includes critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who are trained to manage complex and unstable patients. Their expertise is essential in stabilizing a patient with a tension pneumothorax. **+/- Scoring: +**"

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "**Correct.** Assessing the chest tube tubing is a crucial immediate action. The sudden cessation of tidaling suggests a possible obstruction in the drainage system. Kinks, clots, or dependent loops in the tubing can prevent air and fluid from draining, exacerbating the tension pneumothorax. Identifying and correcting any obstruction can quickly improve the client's condition. **Clinical Pearl:** Always assess the chest tube system when there is a sudden change in drainage or respiratory status. **Pathophysiology:** A blocked chest tube prevents the escape of air from the pleural space, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure and worsening the tension pneumothorax. **+/- Scoring: +**"

        "justification": "**Incorrect.** Clamping the chest tube is contraindicated in this situation. Clamping would prevent any further air or fluid from escaping the pleural space, rapidly increasing intrathoracic pressure and worsening the tension pneumothorax. Clamping is only indicated in specific situations, such as briefly during chest tube removal or when changing the drainage system, and requires a physician's order. **Clinical Pearl:** Never clamp a chest tube in a patient with a pneumothorax unless specifically ordered by a physician and with clear rationale. **Pathophysiology:** Clamping traps air within the pleural space, exacerbating the pressure on the lung and mediastinum, leading to cardiovascular collapse. **+/- Scoring: -**"

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "**Incorrect.** Placing the client in a supine position is detrimental. A supine position can further compromise respiratory function by limiting diaphragmatic excursion and increasing the work of breathing. The client should be placed in a high-Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position to maximize lung expansion. **Clinical Pearl:** Positioning can significantly impact respiratory effort. Patients in respiratory distress generally benefit from an upright position. **Pathophysiology:** An upright position allows for greater diaphragmatic movement and improved lung expansion, facilitating gas exchange. **+/- Scoring: -**"

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "**Correct.** Applying a non-rebreather mask is essential to address the severe hypoxemia (SpO2 86%, PaO2 58 mmHg). A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (up to 100%), which can improve oxygen saturation and tissue oxygenation while other interventions are being implemented. **Clinical Pearl:** In patients with severe hypoxemia, a non-rebreather mask is the preferred method of oxygen delivery. **Pathophysiology:** A non-rebreather mask provides a high flow of oxygen, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and improving oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. **+/- Scoring: +**"

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "**Correct.** Preparing for needle decompression is a critical anticipatory action. Needle decompression (thoracostomy) is the immediate treatment for a tension pneumothorax to relieve the pressure in the pleural space. The nurse should gather the necessary supplies (e.g., a large-bore needle, antiseptic solution) to facilitate the procedure as soon as the provider arrives. **Clinical Pearl:** Anticipating the need for emergency procedures and preparing the necessary equipment can save valuable time and improve patient outcomes. **Pathophysiology:** Needle decompression involves inserting a large-bore needle into the pleural space to allow trapped air to escape, relieving pressure on the lung and mediastinum. **+/- Scoring: +**"
