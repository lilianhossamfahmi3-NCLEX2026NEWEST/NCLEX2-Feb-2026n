    "Noticed intermittent, tall, peaked T-waves over the last hour.": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT: Tall, peaked T-waves are a classic ECG finding indicative of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia affects myocardial repolarization, leading to these characteristic T-wave changes. As potassium levels rise, the T-waves become more prominent and peaked. This finding, in conjunction with the elevated potassium level, signifies a critical electrolyte imbalance that can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize the client's cardiac function.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Peaked T-waves are an early and important ECG sign of hyperkalemia. Recognizing this pattern can prompt timely intervention and prevent serious cardiac complications. Always correlate ECG findings with electrolyte levels."
    },
    "88/54": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT: While hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) is a concern and warrants monitoring and potential intervention, it is not the most immediate threat to the client's life in this scenario. The hypotension is likely a consequence of the underlying hyperkalemia and the post-cardiac arrest state. Addressing the hyperkalemia is the priority, as it is the root cause of the instability. Treating the hyperkalemia will likely improve the blood pressure.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In a critical situation, prioritize interventions based on the most immediate threat to life. Treat the underlying cause rather than just the symptoms. Hypotension in this case is secondary to the hyperkalemia and post-arrest state."
    },
    "Potassium (K+): 7.1 mEq/L": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT: A potassium level of 7.1 mEq/L is critically elevated and represents a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. Hyperkalemia disrupts the normal resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to impaired electrical conduction and increased risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, which the client already experienced. The client's rhabdomyolysis (indicated by the extremely high CK level of 25,000 U/L) and acute kidney injury (AKI), evidenced by the elevated BUN and creatinine levels and decreased urine output, are contributing to the hyperkalemia by releasing intracellular potassium and impairing its excretion. This value requires immediate intervention to prevent another cardiac arrest.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hyperkalemia is a medical emergency that can cause fatal arrhythmias. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential. Always correlate lab values with clinical findings and ECG changes. Common causes include kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, and certain medications."
    },
    "Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT: An elevated creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, along with the elevated BUN (45 mg/dL) and oliguria (urine output <5 mL/hr), indicates acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI impairs the kidneys' ability to excrete potassium, contributing to the hyperkalemia. The AKI is likely multifactorial, resulting from dehydration, rhabdomyolysis-induced nephrotoxicity, and potential ischemic injury during the cardiac arrest. Recognizing the AKI is crucial to understanding the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia and guiding appropriate treatment strategies.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) can significantly impact electrolyte balance, particularly potassium. Monitor kidney function closely in patients at risk, and adjust medication dosages accordingly. AKI can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, nephrotoxic medications, and ischemia."
    },
    "Troponin I: 2.5 ng/mL": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT: An elevated troponin level of 2.5 ng/mL is expected after a cardiac arrest and multiple defibrillations due to myocardial injury. Troponin is a cardiac-specific enzyme released into the bloodstream when myocardial cells are damaged. While it confirms cardiac damage, it does not represent the most immediate, reversible life-threat that requires the nurse to stop and intervene. The hyperkalemia poses a more immediate risk to the client's life.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Elevated troponin levels after cardiac arrest are common due to myocardial injury. Focus on addressing reversible causes of instability first, such as electrolyte imbalances and hypoxemia. Serial troponin measurements can help assess the extent of myocardial damage."
    },
    "Lisinopril: 10 mg": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT: Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated in this client due to the hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion by the kidneys. By inhibiting aldosterone, lisinopril can further elevate potassium levels, exacerbating the hyperkalemia and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Administering this medication would be a serious error, directly worsening the client's life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. The nurse must withhold the lisinopril and notify the provider immediately.",
      "clinicalPearl": "ACE inhibitors can exacerbate hyperkalemia, especially in patients with kidney injury. Always review medications in the context of the patient's overall condition and electrolyte levels. Contraindications should be carefully considered before administering any medication."
    },
    "Amiodarone: 1 mg/min": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication commonly used after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation to maintain cardiac stability and prevent recurrence of arrhythmias. There is no indication to question or stop this infusion based on the available data. The amiodarone is helping to stabilize the client's heart rhythm.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Amiodarone is a common antiarrhythmic used after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Do not discontinue without a clear indication. Monitor for potential side effects, such as hypotension and QT prolongation."

    "overall": "The client is in a state of impending crisis due to severe hyperkalemia secondary to rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI). The nurse must recognize the constellation of cues: critical potassium level (7.1 mEq/L), ECG changes (peaked T-waves), and evidence of AKI (high creatinine, oliguria). Recognizing these cues makes it clear that administering the scheduled lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor that can worsen hyperkalemia, is absolutely contraindicated and would be a life-threatening error. The priority action is to withhold the lisinopril and immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose). The nurse should also anticipate orders for continuous ECG monitoring, frequent potassium level checks, and management of the AKI.",
    "rationale": "The client is at risk for another cardiac arrest due to the severe hyperkalemia. The nurse must act quickly to prevent further complications. The lisinopril must be withheld, and the provider must be notified immediately to initiate treatment for the hyperkalemia. The nurse should also monitor the client's ECG and potassium levels closely.",
    "clinicalPearl": "Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. The nurse must be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia and act quickly to prevent life-threatening complications."
