It indicates myocardial irritability and is a harbinger of life-threatening dysrhythmias, including a recurrence of ventricular fibrillation. This finding, combined with the lab value, signals an imminent crisis."

The *cause* of the instability, the hyperkalemia, is the most critical finding to address."

The client's rhabdomyolysis (indicated by high CK) and acute kidney injury (high BUN/Creatinine, low urine output) are the likely causes. This value requires immediate intervention to prevent another arrest."

The kidneys are failing to excrete potassium, which is the root cause of the life-threatening hyperkalemia.

The nurse must recognize the constellation of cues: critical potassium level (7.1 mEq/L), ECG changes (peaked T-waves), and evidence of AKI (high creatinine, oliguria). Recognizing these cues makes it clear that administering the scheduled lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor that can worsen hyperkalemia, is absolutely contraindicated and would be a life-threatening error. The priority action is to withhold the lisinopril and immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose)."
