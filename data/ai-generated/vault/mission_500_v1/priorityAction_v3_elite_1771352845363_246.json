The laboratory results showing elevated CK, potassium, and creatinine indicate rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury, which are life-threatening complications. The cause is the combination of multiple serotonergic agents: sertraline (an SSRI), tramadol (an opioid with serotonergic activity), and linezolid (an antibiotic that is also a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)). The absolute priority and 'SAFETY STOP' action is to remove the offending agents.
