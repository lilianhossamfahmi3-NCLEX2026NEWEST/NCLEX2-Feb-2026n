The sudden onset of headache, altered level of consciousness (drowsiness, difficulty arousing), and pupillary changes (anisocoria) at 1800 are concerning for increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The vital sign trends show a progression towards Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), a late sign of brainstem compression. The STAT head CT confirms an acute parenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect and midline shift, indicating significant ICP. The lab results reveal a decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggesting active bleeding, and a therapeutic aPTT, indicating that the heparin is contributing to the hemorrhage.
