This is an expected, but dangerous, consequence of initial fluid resuscitation and correction of acidosis, which drives potassium from the extracellular fluid back into the cells. Administering insulin would exacerbate this shift, causing profound hypokalemia. Severe hypokalemia (K+ < 3.3 mEq/L, and especially < 3.0 mEq/L) is a life-threatening emergency that can lead to fatal cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) and respiratory muscle paralysis. The ECG findings of flattened T-waves and prominent U-waves confirm the cardiac effect of the hypokalemia. Therefore, the standard DKA protocol must be paused. The nurse must recognize this 'Safety Stop' moment. The provider must be notified to obtain orders for IV potassium replacement before insulin therapy can be safely initiated.",

The order is no longer safe to follow due to the change in the client's condition."
