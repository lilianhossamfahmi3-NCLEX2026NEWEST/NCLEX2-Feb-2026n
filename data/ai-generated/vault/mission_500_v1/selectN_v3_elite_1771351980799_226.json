Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits platelet aggregation and is nephrotoxic. The client's critically low platelet count (42,000/mm³) constitutes severe thrombocytopenia, creating a high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (e.g., hepatic hematoma, intracranial bleed) if an antiplatelet medication is administered. Additionally, the elevated serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL) indicates acute kidney injury, a contraindication for the nephrotoxic ketorolac. The nurse's primary responsibility is to recognize these critical safety risks, withhold the medication, and immediately consult the provider for an alternative, safer analgesic.",

A platelet count below 50,000/mm³ indicates severe thrombocytopenia and is an absolute contraindication for administering ketorolac. As an NSAID, ketorolac impairs platelet function, which would dramatically increase the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage in a client who already has a critically low platelet count."
