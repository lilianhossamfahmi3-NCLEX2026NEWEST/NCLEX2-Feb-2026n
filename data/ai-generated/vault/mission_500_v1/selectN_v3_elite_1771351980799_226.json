    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize information from all exhibits to identify life-threatening contraindications to the prescribed PRN medication, ketorolac. Ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are involved in platelet aggregation and renal blood flow regulation. The client's critically low platelet count (42,000/mm³) indicates severe thrombocytopenia, increasing the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (e.g., hepatic hematoma, intracranial bleed) if an antiplatelet medication is administered. Additionally, the elevated serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL) suggests acute kidney injury, potentially due to preeclampsia-induced renal vasoconstriction and glomerular damage, making the nephrotoxic ketorolac contraindicated. The nurse's priority is to recognize these critical safety risks, withhold the medication, and immediately consult the provider for a safer analgesic alternative.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent expected findings in HELLP syndrome or are indications for treatment, not reasons to withhold ketorolac. Failing to recognize the contraindications and proceeding with ketorolac administration could lead to catastrophic bleeding and worsen renal failure, representing a critical safety error.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "Epigastric pain",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Epigastric pain is a key symptom of HELLP syndrome, indicating liver swelling and capsular distention due to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction and hepatocellular necrosis. While it signals disease severity and risk of hepatic rupture, it is a symptom to be managed, not a direct contraindication to administering ketorolac. It contributes to the client's pain, but other factors preclude ketorolac administration."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "This severe hypertension is an indication to administer the PRN labetalol, not a reason to withhold a medication. Labetalol is a beta-adrenergic blocker that reduces blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. The nurse should administer the antihypertensive as prescribed."

        "content": "Platelet count of 42,000/mm³",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' finding. A platelet count below 50,000/mm³ indicates severe thrombocytopenia, often due to increased platelet consumption and destruction in HELLP syndrome. Ketorolac, as an NSAID, impairs platelet function by inhibiting thromboxane A2 production, which is essential for platelet aggregation. Administering ketorolac would dramatically increase the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage in a client who already has a critically low platelet count."

        "justification": "This is another critical 'SAFETY STOP' finding. Elevated creatinine indicates acute kidney injury, a common complication of severe preeclampsia due to glomerular endothelial damage and decreased renal perfusion. Ketorolac is nephrotoxic because NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Its use is contraindicated in clients with advanced renal impairment, making this a clear reason to withhold the drug and notify the provider."

However, the nurse must first assess for contraindications before treating the indication. This is a classic NGN distractor testing the ability to prioritize safety over symptom management."

        "justification": "Elevated LDH confirms microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, a component of the HELLP triad (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). Hemolysis occurs due to mechanical destruction of red blood cells as they pass through damaged blood vessels. While it confirms the diagnosis and severity, it is not a direct contraindication to ketorolac administration. The focus for medication safety here is on platelet function and renal function."
