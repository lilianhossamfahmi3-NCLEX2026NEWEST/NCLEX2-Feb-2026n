    "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic triad of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) following a long bone fracture: neurological changes (restlessness, confusion), respiratory distress (dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia), and a petechial rash. The ABG results from 0600 (06:00) already showed significant hypoxemia (PaO2 65 mmHg) with respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.48, PaCO2 30 mmHg), and the client has now acutely decompensated with an SpO2 of 88%. This is a medical emergency indicating the procedure must be stopped. The priority is immediate respiratory support to address life-threatening hypoxia. The pathophysiology of FES involves the release of fat globules from the bone marrow into the bloodstream after a fracture. These globules can travel to the lungs, causing inflammation, capillary damage, and impaired gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. In addition, fat emboli can also affect the brain, causing neurological symptoms. The correct sequence is: 1) Position the client to ease breathing (fastest intervention). 2) Apply high-flow oxygen to correct severe hypoxia. 3) Escalate care immediately to the RRT and inform the surgeon of the client's critical instability, halting the plan for surgery. 4) Initiate continuous monitoring to track the client's response. 5) Anticipate the need for intubation as FES often progresses to ARDS. 6) Withhold the non-emergent pre-operative antibiotic as surgery is now contraindicated.",
    "incorrect": "Any other order of actions poses a significant safety risk. Delaying positioning and oxygenation to call the RRT or place a monitor fails to address the immediate life-threatening hypoxia. Proceeding with any pre-operative tasks, such as administering cefazolin, demonstrates a failure to recognize the 'STOP' situation and the client's critical deterioration. The client is too unstable for transport or surgery. Notifying the RRT is crucial, but it must not delay direct, immediate life-saving actions like oxygenation.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the most immediate, independent nursing action to improve oxygenation. Elevating the head of the bed facilitates lung expansion, decreases the work of breathing, and can be performed in seconds while preparing other interventions. This position promotes optimal lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm and increasing thoracic volume, thereby improving ventilation and oxygenation."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "The client's SpO2 of 88% with a respiratory rate of 32 indicates severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress. This is the 'killer' condition. Applying the highest concentration of oxygen possible via a non-rebreather mask is the priority therapeutic intervention to prevent further decompensation and end-organ damage. A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-90%) by providing a tight seal around the nose and mouth and preventing the rebreathing of exhaled air. This helps to maximize oxygen delivery to the alveoli and improve arterial oxygen saturation."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "After initiating immediate life-saving measures, the nurse must escalate care. The RRT brings critical care expertise to the bedside. Notifying the surgeon is a critical 'STOP' action, communicating that the client is hemodynamically unstable and the scheduled surgery must be canceled or postponed. The RRT consists of a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists, who are trained to respond to patients with deteriorating conditions. Early activation of the RRT can help to prevent adverse outcomes, such as cardiac arrest and respiratory failure."

        "content": "Place the client on a continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitor.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "With severe hypoxia and physiological stress, the client is at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias and further desaturation. Continuous monitoring is essential for titrating oxygen, assessing the client's response to interventions, and providing early warning of cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for the early detection of arrhythmias, which can be a sign of myocardial ischemia or electrolyte imbalances. Pulse oximetry provides continuous monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, allowing for timely adjustments to oxygen therapy."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "FES often progresses rapidly to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which requires mechanical ventilation. The client's profound hypoxia and respiratory distress are unlikely to resolve with non-invasive oxygen alone. The prudent nurse anticipates this and prepares equipment for intubation. ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury characterized by inflammation, pulmonary edema, and impaired gas exchange. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation in patients with ARDS."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This action confirms the nurse's understanding of the 'STOP' situation. The client is critically ill and the surgery is contraindicated. Administering a non-emergent medication for a canceled procedure is inappropriate and diverts focus from life-saving priorities. This is the last action as it is an act of omission rather than a direct intervention."

The classic triad includes respiratory distress, neurological changes, and petechial rash. Prompt intervention with oxygen and hemodynamic support can significantly improve outcomes. Always consider FES in patients with long bone fractures who develop sudden respiratory distress or neurological changes. Monitor platelet levels as thrombocytopenia can occur in FES due to platelet aggregation around fat globules. Consider early administration of corticosteroids, as they may help reduce inflammation and improve pulmonary function in FES.",
