The ABG results from 0600 already showed significant hypoxemia (PaO2 65) with respiratory alkalosis, and the client has now acutely decompensated with an SpO2 of 88%. This is a medical emergency indicating the procedure must be stopped. The priority is immediate respiratory support to address life-threatening hypoxia. The correct sequence is: 1) Position the client to ease breathing (fastest intervention). 2) Apply high-flow oxygen to correct severe hypoxia. 3) Escalate care immediately to the RRT and inform the surgeon of the client's critical instability, halting the plan for surgery. 4) Initiate continuous monitoring to track the client's response. 5) Anticipate the need for intubation as FES often progresses to ARDS. 6) Withhold the non-emergent pre-operative antibiotic as surgery is now contraindicated.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order of actions poses a significant safety risk. Delaying positioning and oxygenation to call the RRT or place a monitor fails to address the immediate life-threatening hypoxia. Proceeding with any pre-operative tasks, such as administering cefazolin, demonstrates a failure to recognize the 'STOP' situation and the client's critical deterioration. The client is too unstable for transport or surgery. Notifying the RRT is crucial, but it must not delay direct, immediate life-saving actions like oxygenation.",
