Client reports inconsistent prenatal care due to recent immigration and transportation challenges. Antecubital 18-gauge IV started. Magnesium sulfate 4g loading dose administered over 20 minutes, maintenance infusion started at 2 g/hr. Labetalol 20 mg IV given. Client is on continuous fetal monitoring.\n\n<strong>2200:</strong> Client reports feeling 'woozy and hot all over' and that her 'breathing feels heavy.' States vision is blurry. Rates epigastric pain as a dull ache, 8/10. Client appears flushed and is slow to respond to questions. Partner at bedside appears anxious. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) assessed and are 0/4 bilaterally. Urine output via indwelling catheter 20 mL in the last hour."
