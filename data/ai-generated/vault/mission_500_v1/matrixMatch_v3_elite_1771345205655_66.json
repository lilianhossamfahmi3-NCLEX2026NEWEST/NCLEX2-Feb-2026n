This is a life-threatening condition. The nurse's priority is to immediately stop the offending agents and provide supportive care. Indicated actions include administering lorazepam to control agitation and neuromuscular excitation, applying cooling measures for severe hyperthermia, inserting a urinary catheter to monitor for rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), and anticipating the use of the serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine. Withholding further serotonergic agents is a critical safety stop.",
        "incorrect": "Administering the scheduled sertraline is the most dangerous action, as it would worsen the toxic serotonin levels and accelerate the client's decline. Administering acetaminophen is also contraindicated; the hyperthermia in Serotonin Syndrome is caused by muscle hyperactivity and central serotonin dysregulation, not by a change in the hypothalamic set point, making antipyretics ineffective and potentially harmful by masking the true severity. Delaying essential care to pursue non-essential actions like a nutrition consult demonstrates a failure to recognize and act on a life-threatening emergency.",
