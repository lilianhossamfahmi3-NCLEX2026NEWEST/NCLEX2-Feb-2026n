    "correct": "The client's presentation is a textbook case of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening emergency. NMS is characterized by hyperthermia, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology involves a rapid reduction in dopamine activity, leading to dysregulation of the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus and uncontrolled muscle contraction. This results in hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis (indicated by the elevated CK). Autonomic instability manifests as tachycardia, labile blood pressure, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. The absolute priority is to withhold the offending agent (haloperidol) to prevent further dopamine blockade and worsening of the syndrome. Immediate notification of the provider is essential to initiate emergency treatment, which includes dantrolene or bromocriptine (muscle relaxants) and supportive care in an ICU setting.",
    "incorrect": "All other actions fail to address the root cause of this life-threatening syndrome and represent a critical safety error. Continuing the haloperidol would exacerbate the condition. Treating individual symptoms (fever with acetaminophen, agitation with lorazepam) without stopping the causative agent is ineffective and delays definitive care. NMS-related hyperthermia is due to muscle contraction, not a typical hypothalamic response, so antipyretics are largely ineffective. While cooling blankets are a necessary supportive measure, they are secondary to stopping the cause. Misinterpreting the altered mental status as simple agitation and administering lorazepam (or worse, secluding the client) ignores the underlying pathophysiology and places the client at extreme risk.",
