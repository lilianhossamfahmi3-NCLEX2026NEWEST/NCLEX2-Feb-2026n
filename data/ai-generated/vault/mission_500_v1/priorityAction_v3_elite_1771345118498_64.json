The cardinal features are all present: severe hyperthermia (39.8°C), extreme muscle rigidity ('lead-pipe'), autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile hypertension, tachypnea, diaphoresis), and altered mental status (confusion, disorientation). The laboratory results confirm this diagnosis, with a massively elevated creatine kinase (CK > 22,000 U/L) indicating severe muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), leukocytosis, and early signs of acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine). NMS is a direct toxic effect of dopamine-blocking agents like haloperidol. The absolute priority and 'SAFETY STOP' action is to withhold the next dose of the offending agent to prevent the syndrome from worsening, which can be fatal. Immediately notifying the provider is essential to initiate emergency treatment, which includes dantrolene or bromocriptine and supportive care in an ICU setting.",
        "incorrect": "All other actions fail to address the root cause of this life-threatening syndrome and represent a critical safety error. Continuing the haloperidol would be like adding fuel to a fire. Treating individual symptoms (fever with acetaminophen, agitation with lorazepam) without stopping the causative agent is ineffective and delays definitive care. NMS-related hyperthermia is due to muscle contraction, not a typical hypothalamic response, so antipyretics are largely ineffective. While cooling blankets are a necessary supportive measure, they are secondary to stopping the cause. Misinterpreting the altered mental status as simple agitation and administering lorazepam (or worse, secluding the client) ignores the underlying pathophysiology and places the client at extreme risk.",
