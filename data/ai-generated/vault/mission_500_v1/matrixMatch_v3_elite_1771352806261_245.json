        "correct": "The nurse must synthesize the data to identify the most immediate life-threatening condition. The critical hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) in a client with an acute MI creates an extremely high risk for fatal dysrhythmias. Administering furosemide, a potassium-wasting diuretic, is absolutely contraindicated as it would worsen the electrolyte imbalance and could precipitate cardiac arrest. Therefore, the essential actions are to correct the hypokalemia (administer potassium), support perfusion (titrate dobutamine as MAP is borderline), and prepare for potential cardiac collapse by having emergency pacing ready. Palliative care is appropriate but not an immediate life-saving action.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindication of administering furosemide is a critical safety error. Selecting 'Non-Essential' for potassium replacement or hemodynamic support fails to address the immediate life threats.
