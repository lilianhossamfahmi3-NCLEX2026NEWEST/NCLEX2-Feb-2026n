    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize the data to identify the most immediate life-threatening condition. The critical hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) in a client with an acute MI creates an extremely high risk for fatal dysrhythmias. Administering furosemide, a potassium-wasting diuretic, is absolutely contraindicated as it would worsen the electrolyte imbalance and could precipitate cardiac arrest. Therefore, the essential actions are to correct the hypokalemia (administer potassium), support perfusion (titrate dobutamine as MAP is borderline), and prepare for potential cardiac collapse by having emergency pacing ready. Palliative care is appropriate but not an immediate life-saving action.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the contraindication of administering furosemide is a critical safety error. Selecting 'Non-Essential' for potassium replacement or hemodynamic support fails to address the immediate life threats. Choosing 'Essential' for a palliative care consult prioritizes long-term planning over acute stabilization.",

        "content": "This action is **Contraindicated**. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and water. In a client with cardiogenic shock and critical hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L), administering furosemide would further deplete potassium levels, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The already compromised myocardium is highly sensitive to electrolyte imbalances. This could lead to cardiac arrest.",

In the setting of an acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, this risk is significantly amplified. Potassium replacement is crucial to stabilize the cardiac membrane potential and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes or ventricular fibrillation.

The client is in cardiogenic shock, evidenced by a declining MAP (69 mmHg), elevated lactate (4.2 mmol/L), and decreased urine output (15 mL/hr), indicating inadequate tissue perfusion. Titrating dobutamine to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg is crucial to improve cardiac output and ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs.

The combination of acute MI, cardiogenic shock, and severe hypokalemia places the client at extremely high risk for developing symptomatic bradycardia or heart block. Hypokalemia can impair the sinoatrial (SA) node and atrioventricular (AV) node function, leading to bradyarrhythmias.
