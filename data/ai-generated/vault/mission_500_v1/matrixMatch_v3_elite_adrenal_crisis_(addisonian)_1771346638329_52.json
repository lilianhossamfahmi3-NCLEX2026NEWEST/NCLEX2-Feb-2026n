Hydrocortisone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, replaces the deficient cortisol, addressing the underlying pathophysiology of the crisis. Cortisol normally regulates blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and the immune response. In its absence, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and shock can occur. IV administration ensures rapid absorption and action in this emergency. **Clinical Pearl:** Addisonian crisis can be triggered by stress (e.g., infection), trauma, or abrupt cessation of steroid therapy.",
