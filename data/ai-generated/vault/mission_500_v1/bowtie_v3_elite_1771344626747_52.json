Tidaling is present in the water seal chamber. Breath sounds diminished on the left. Client's primary language is Spanish; a certified interpreter was used for admission assessment.\n\n1100: Client becomes acutely restless and agitated, grabbing at the oxygen cannula. Using a translator phone, the client reports severe, sharp chest pain and says, \"I can't breathe.\" Assessment reveals no tidaling in the water seal chamber, jugular venous distention (JVD), and palpable subcutaneous emphysema around the chest tube insertion site."

        "correct": "The client's presentation is a classic picture of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. The obstructed chest tube has allowed air to enter the pleural space without escaping, causing the lung to collapse and creating a positive-pressure environment. This pressure causes a mediastinal shift, compressing the heart and great vessels (vena cava), which leads to decreased venous return, decreased cardiac output, and ultimately obstructive shock. The vital signs (severe tachycardia, profound hypotension, hypoxia), physical exam (JVD, absent tidaling, subcutaneous emphysema), and CXR definitively confirm this diagnosis. The nurse's absolute priority is to facilitate immediate lung re-expansion. This requires notifying the RRT/provider for emergency intervention (needle decompression or chest tube insertion/replacement) and preparing the necessary equipment. Monitoring for tracheal deviation (a late but critical sign of mediastinal shift) and blood pressure (an indicator of worsening obstructive shock) are essential to track the client's rapid deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "The distractors represent plausible but incorrect diagnoses and actions for this specific clinical picture. Administering morphine is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' error; it would cause respiratory depression, worsen hypoxia, and mask neurological changes in a client already in shock. Increasing suction or repositioning is futile and potentially harmful with an obstructed tube. Other diagnoses like ARDS, cardiac tamponade, hemorrhagic shock, and PE have some overlapping symptoms but do not align with the full clinical picture, especially the unilateral physical exam findings and the definitive CXR report of a mediastinal shift from an obstructed chest tube.",
