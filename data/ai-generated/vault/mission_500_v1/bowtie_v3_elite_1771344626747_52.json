Client's primary language is Spanish; a certified interpreter was used for admission assessment.\n\n1100: Client becomes acutely restless and agitated, grabbing at the oxygen cannula. Using a translator phone, the client reports severe, sharp chest pain and says, \"I can't breathe.\" Assessment reveals no tidaling in the water seal chamber, jugular venous distention (JVD), and palpable subcutaneous emphysema around the chest tube insertion site."

    "correct": "The client is developing a tension pneumothorax. The obstructed chest tube prevents air from escaping the pleural space, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This compresses the lung, shifts the mediastinum, and obstructs venous return, causing obstructive shock. The vital signs (tachycardia 148 bpm, hypotension 85/50 mmHg, SpO2 84%), physical exam (JVD, absent tidaling, subcutaneous emphysema), and CXR (mediastinal shift, hyperlucent hemithorax) confirm this. The priority is to notify the RRT/provider for emergency intervention (needle decompression or chest tube replacement) and prepare the necessary equipment. Monitoring tracheal deviation (a late sign of mediastinal shift) and blood pressure (an indicator of obstructive shock) are essential.",

Morphine is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' error; it would cause respiratory depression, worsen hypoxia, and mask neurological changes.
