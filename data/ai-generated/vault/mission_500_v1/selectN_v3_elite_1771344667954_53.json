Amiodarone, a potassium channel blocker, is known to prolong the QT interval further. Administering it to a client with a baseline prolonged QTc, bradycardia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia creates an imminent risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a lethal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The nurse's priority is to recognize this contraindication and take immediate action to prevent a second cardiac arrest. The correct actions are to **withhold the offending agent (amiodarone)**, **notify the provider** of the critical ECG finding, and **proactively prepare for the potential consequences (TdP or worsening bradycardia) by placing pacer pads**.",
        "incorrect": "Administering the amiodarone infusion is the most dangerous action and represents a failure to recognize a critical safety stop. This action could directly precipitate a fatal arrhythmia. Requesting a beta-blocker is also unsafe as it would worsen the existing severe bradycardia (HR 48 bpm). Increasing the norepinephrine is not indicated as the MAP is currently stable and above the target of 65 mmHg. While correcting the low potassium is important, stopping the drug that could trigger an immediate fatal arrhythmia is the highest priority.",
