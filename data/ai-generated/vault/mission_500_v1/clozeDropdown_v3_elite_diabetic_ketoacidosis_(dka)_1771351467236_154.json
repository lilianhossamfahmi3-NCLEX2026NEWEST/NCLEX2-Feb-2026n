On assessment, client is lethargic, groans to painful stimuli but does not open eyes or follow commands (GCS 8: E2, V2, M4). Mucous membranes are dry, skin turgor is poor. A strong, fruity odor is noted on the breath. A small abrasion is present on the forehead, appears recent."

While the client was initially showing signs of hypovolemia (tachycardia, hypotension), the most recent vital signs (hypertension, bradycardia) are the opposite of what is expected in hypovolemic shock. This new trend indicates a different, more acute pathological process."

This triad of symptoms is known as Cushing's triad, a classic and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This clinical picture is directly confirmed by the head CT finding of effaced sulci, which indicates cerebral edema. Cerebral edema is a rare but life-threatening complication of DKA."

        "c1_opt3": {
            "isCorrect": false,

        "c1_opt4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While an acute MI can precipitate DKA, the client's primary signs and symptoms (Cushing's triad, neurological decline) and diagnostic findings (Head CT) point directly to a neurological emergency. The vital sign trend is not typical for an acute MI."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While insulin is essential for treating DKA, the immediate life threat is brainstem herniation from cerebral edema. Administering insulin without appropriate fluid management can rapidly lower blood glucose and serum osmolality, worsening the fluid shift into brain cells. The priority is to address the cerebral edema first."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Altering the rate of a prescribed infusion without a provider's order is outside the nurse's scope of practice. More importantly, even a slower infusion of 0.9% NaCl could still worsen the cerebral edema by lowering serum osmolality. The entire fluid management plan needs to be re-evaluated by the provider, likely to include hypertonic solutions or osmotic diuretics."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. This is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' moment. The nurse has identified a life-threatening complication (cerebral edema) for which the standard treatment (large-volume bolus of 0.9% NaCl) is contraindicated. Rapid infusion of relatively hypotonic fluids can exacerbate cerebral edema by causing a rapid decrease in plasma osmolality, shifting free water into the brain tissue. The nurse's priority is to withhold this potentially harmful intervention and immediately communicate the critical findings (Cushing's triad, CT results) to the provider for new orders, which may include mannitol or hypertonic saline."
        },
        "c2_opt4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's GCS of 8 and irregular, shallow respirations are highly concerning and may indeed necessitate intubation. However, preparing for intubation is a collaborative action that follows the nurse's primary independent action. The most immediate priority for the nurse is to recognize the contraindication, stop the harmful ordered intervention (the fluid bolus), and alert the provider. The provider will then order interventions such as intubation."
