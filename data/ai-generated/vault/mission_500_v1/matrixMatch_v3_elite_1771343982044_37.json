The immediate priorities are to restore circulation and terminate the lethal rhythm. According to ACLS guidelines, high-quality CPR and defibrillation are the most critical, immediate interventions for V-Fib. All other actions, while potentially necessary, are secondary and performed after CPR and defibrillation have been initiated.",

V-Fib results in zero cardiac output, leading to irreversible brain damage and death within minutes. Checking for a pulse when the monitor clearly shows V-Fib in an unresponsive patient wastes critical time. Administering medications before attempting defibrillation deviates from evidence-based ACLS protocols and reduces the chance of survival.",
