    "correct": "The client is experiencing ventricular fibrillation (V-fib), a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by chaotic, disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, resulting in no effective cardiac output. This is likely secondary to an acute myocardial infarction (elevated troponin) and exacerbated by severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.2 mEq/L). The immediate priorities are to restore circulation and terminate the lethal rhythm. According to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are the most critical, immediate interventions for V-fib. CPR provides artificial circulation to vital organs, while defibrillation aims to depolarize the myocardium and allow the heart's natural pacemaker to regain control. All other actions, while potentially necessary, are secondary and performed after CPR and defibrillation have been initiated to maximize the client's chance of survival.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting actions that delay CPR and defibrillation is a critical safety error. V-fib results in zero cardiac output, leading to irreversible brain damage and death within minutes due to lack of oxygenated blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. Checking for a pulse when the monitor clearly shows V-fib in an unresponsive patient wastes critical time that should be spent delivering life-saving interventions. Administering medications before attempting defibrillation deviates from evidence-based ACLS protocols and reduces the chance of successful defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).",

        "content": "Correct. In any cardiac arrest, immediate initiation of high-quality chest compressions is essential to provide artificial circulation to the brain and vital organs until a perfusing rhythm can be restored. Chest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute and a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) but no more than 2.4 inches (6 cm) for adults. Minimize interruptions in chest compressions to maximize effectiveness."

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used in V-fib/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) that is unresponsive to defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressor (epinephrine) therapy. It helps to stabilize the cardiac rhythm and increase the likelihood of successful defibrillation. It is a subsequent action, administered after the first or second shock if the client remains in V-fib/pulseless V-tach."

It delivers a controlled electrical shock to depolarize the entire myocardium simultaneously, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node) to resume control and establish a normal heart rhythm. It must be performed as soon as possible after confirming V-fib on the monitor. The energy level for defibrillation is typically 120-200 joules (biphasic) or 360 joules (monophasic), depending on the defibrillator type."

V-fib is a non-perfusing rhythm by definition, meaning there is no effective cardiac output and therefore no palpable pulse. Taking time to confirm pulselessness delays life-saving interventions (CPR and defibrillation). In a monitored, witnessed arrest with V-fib, the nurse should immediately proceed with the C-A-B (Compressions, Airway, Breathing) sequence of resuscitation."

The client has severe hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L), which is a likely contributor to the cardiac arrest by affecting the myocardial cell's resting membrane potential and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. IV calcium gluconate is indicated to stabilize the cardiac membrane and reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia. Calcium gluconate does not lower the potassium level but temporarily protects the heart from its effects. It is administered as a subsequent priority during the code, after CPR and defibrillation have been initiated. Other treatments for hyperkalemia, such as insulin and glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and kayexalate, may also be considered."
