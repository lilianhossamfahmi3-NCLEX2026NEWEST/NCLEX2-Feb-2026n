    "rationale": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of a potential adrenal crisis, a life-threatening condition resulting from insufficient cortisol and aldosterone. This is likely triggered by the stress of surgery, coupled with the possibility of missed hydrocortisone doses. Key indicators include altered mental status, hypotension, oliguria, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. The priority is to recognize the crisis and prevent actions that could worsen the condition. Administering spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, to a client with hyperkalemia is a critical error. Therefore, the nurse must withhold this medication and immediately contact the provider to report the client's condition and advocate for immediate treatment with IV hydrocortisone and fluids.",
