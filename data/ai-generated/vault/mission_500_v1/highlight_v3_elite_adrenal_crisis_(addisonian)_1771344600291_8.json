Complaining of 'intense' abdominal pain, rated 8/10, despite recent dose of hydromorphone. States 'everything tastes bland' and repeatedly asks for salt packets. Skin is cool and clammy. Surgical incision clean, dry, and intact. Urine output 20 mL over the last hour. Client's partner mentions they had trouble getting to the pre-op appointment due to unreliable public transport and is unsure if the client took their morning hydrocortisone on the day of surgery."

        "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of an adrenal (Addisonian) crisis, a life-threatening condition caused by acute cortisol and aldosterone deficiency. This is likely precipitated by the stress of surgery combined with potentially missed steroid doses. The key clinical indicators are profound hypotension (refractory shock), altered mental status, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and severe hyperkalemia. The nurse's priority is to recognize this crisis and identify any actions that could worsen the client's condition. Administering a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone) to a client with life-threatening hyperkalemia is a critical, potentially fatal error. Therefore, the nurse must withhold this medication and immediately contact the provider to report the full clinical picture and advocate for immediate treatment with IV hydrocortisone and fluids.",
