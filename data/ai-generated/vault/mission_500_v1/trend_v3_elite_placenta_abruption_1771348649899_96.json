The nurse must recognize the constellation of findings (hypotension, tachycardia, fetal distress, rigid abdomen) and, most critically, the laboratory evidence of DIC (thrombocytopenia, critically low fibrinogen, high D-dimer). This requires immediate resuscitation and questioning any order that could worsen the hemorrhage or mask its severity.",

      "rationale": "The critically low fibrinogen level of 90 mg/dL is the most concerning finding, strongly indicating Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). Placental abruption can trigger the release of thromboplastin, leading to widespread micro-clotting and consumption of clotting factors, especially fibrinogen. A fibrinogen level below 100 mg/dL signifies a severe consumptive coagulopathy, explaining the oozing from the IV site and the rapid progression to hemorrhagic shock. Immediate intervention with blood products like cryoprecipitate is crucial to replenish fibrinogen and restore clotting ability. The other options, while concerning, are less specific to the immediate threat of DIC and its consequences. Oozing from the IV site is a manifestation of the coagulopathy, while changes in heart rate and blood pressure are indicators of hypovolemia, and thrombocytopenia contributes to the bleeding tendency. The low fibrinogen level is the most direct indicator of the underlying pathology driving the client's deterioration."

        "rationale": "Administering Terbutaline is incorrect and unsafe. Terbutaline is a tocolytic, a medication used to relax the uterus. In a client experiencing a severe placental abruption and hemorrhage, tocolytics are strictly contraindicated. The pathophysiology behind this contraindication lies in the fact that uterine contractions are a natural mechanism to control bleeding at the placental site. By relaxing the uterus, Terbutaline can exacerbate the hemorrhage, potentially leading to further maternal compromise and fetal distress. Furthermore, tocolytics can mask the clinical signs of a worsening abruption, such as increasing uterine rigidity, delaying critical interventions. The priority is to prepare for delivery, not to stop contractions."

The nurse must exercise their clinical judgment and act as a patient advocate by questioning orders that are contraindicated and potentially harmful. In this scenario, the nurse should immediately voice their concern to the provider, explaining that a tocolytic is unsafe given the evidence of severe abruption, hemorrhage, and DIC. This action demonstrates the nurse's understanding of the client's condition and the potential risks associated with the prescribed medication. The nurse should also suggest alternative interventions that are more appropriate for managing the client's condition, such as preparing for immediate delivery and continuing resuscitation efforts."

        "rationale": "Increasing the Lactated Ringer's infusion rate to a bolus is a correct and immediate action. The client's vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia) are clear indicators of hypovolemic shock, resulting from blood loss due to the placental abruption. The pathophysiology of hypovolemic shock involves a decrease in circulating blood volume, leading to reduced cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. Increasing the infusion rate of an isotonic crystalloid solution like Lactated Ringer's is a priority intervention to restore intravascular volume and improve hemodynamic stability. Lactated Ringer's is preferred because its electrolyte composition is similar to that of blood plasma, helping to maintain electrolyte balance during resuscitation. While awaiting blood products, fluid resuscitation helps to maintain organ perfusion and prevent further deterioration."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Applying oxygen at 10 L/min via a non-rebreather mask is a correct and priority action. The late decelerations in the fetal heart rate (FHR) indicate uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning that the fetus is not receiving adequate oxygen. Additionally, the client's low SpO2 and signs of shock indicate poor maternal perfusion and oxygenation. The pathophysiology behind this intervention is to maximize oxygen delivery to both the fetus and the mother's vital organs. A non-rebreather mask provides a high concentration of oxygen, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the maternal blood and improving oxygen transfer across the placenta to the fetus. This helps to alleviate fetal hypoxia and support maternal oxygenation during the resuscitation process."

        "rationale": "Placing the client in a high Fowler's position is incorrect. This position would decrease venous return to the heart and worsen hypotension, exacerbating the hypovolemic shock. The client should be placed in a left lateral position (or manually displaced if supine) to displace the gravid uterus off the vena cava and aorta. The gravid uterus can compress these major vessels, reducing cardiac output and placental perfusion. By relieving this compression, venous return to the heart is improved, increasing cardiac output and enhancing placental blood flow. This position optimizes maternal hemodynamics and fetal oxygenation."

        "rationale": "Notifying the blood bank of a potential massive transfusion is a correct and vital action. The client exhibits clinical and laboratory evidence of DIC and hemorrhagic shock, both life-threatening conditions requiring immediate intervention. DIC is characterized by the widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in uncontrolled bleeding. A massive transfusion protocol (MTP) is a coordinated approach to rapidly transfuse large volumes of blood products (PRBCs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate) to restore blood volume, correct coagulopathy, and improve oxygen-carrying capacity. Activating the blood bank early ensures that blood products are readily available for resuscitation, minimizing delays in treatment and improving the client's chances of survival."

While the client is experiencing pain, administering an oral analgesic is not a priority during a life-threatening hemorrhage and preparation for emergency surgery. The priority is hemodynamic stabilization and addressing the underlying cause of the pain, which is the placental abruption. Furthermore, pain is an important clinical indicator, and masking it could delay recognition of worsening status. The focus should be on interventions that directly address the hemorrhage and DIC, such as fluid resuscitation, blood product transfusion, and preparation for delivery."
