Placental abruption can trigger a massive release of thromboplastin, leading to widespread micro-clotting that consumes all clotting factors, particularly fibrinogen. A level below 100 mg/dL in this context is catastrophic and explains the oozing from the IV site and the rapid progression to hemorrhagic shock. This finding signals a consumptive coagulopathy, which is the most immediate threat to both maternal and fetal life and requires specific replacement with products like cryoprecipitate."
