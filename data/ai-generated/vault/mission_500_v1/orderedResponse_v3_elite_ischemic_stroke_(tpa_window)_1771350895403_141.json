Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, is contraindicated in clients with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/μL) due to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The pathophysiology behind this contraindication lies in the impaired ability to form blood clots, which is essential to stop bleeding. Administering alteplase in this situation could lead to uncontrolled bleeding in the brain, causing severe neurological damage or death.",

After notifying the provider and confirming that alteplase will be withheld, communicating this change in the plan of care to the family is essential. This manages expectations and allows for discussion of alternative treatments. Open communication with the family is crucial in stroke care. The pathophysiology of stroke involves disruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to ischemia and potential infarction. Alteplase aims to restore blood flow, but in the presence of thrombocytopenia, the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits.",

While the client's blood pressure of 182/104 mmHg is still above the target of <185/110 mmHg for alteplase administration, managing the blood pressure is still important for general stroke management. Hypertension in acute stroke can exacerbate cerebral edema and increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Labetalol, a beta-blocker, helps lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance without significantly affecting cerebral blood flow.",

Since the client is not a candidate for alteplase due to severe thrombocytopenia, calculating the dose is an unnecessary step.

However, in the presence of thrombocytopenia, the risk of bleeding outweighs the potential benefits of clot lysis.",
