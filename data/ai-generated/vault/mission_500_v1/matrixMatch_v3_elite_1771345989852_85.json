    "correct": "The client presents with signs and symptoms indicative of severe lithium toxicity, including confusion, ataxia, tremors, elevated BUN/Creatinine, hypotension, and ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U waves, prolonged QTc). The lithium level is critically elevated at 2.2 mEq/L (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). The client's recent use of an herbal diuretic likely exacerbated the toxicity by causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia).\n\nThe priority is to prevent further lithium absorption and enhance its excretion. IV normal saline helps restore fluid volume and promote renal excretion of lithium. Seizure precautions are necessary due to the neurotoxic effects of lithium. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential arrhythmias. Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity to rapidly remove the drug from the body.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early recognition of lithium toxicity is crucial. Mild to moderate toxicity can often be managed with IV fluids and supportive care, while severe toxicity requires emergent hemodialysis.",
    "incorrect": "Administering more lithium or furosemide would worsen the client's condition and could lead to life-threatening complications. Lithium would further elevate the toxic level, exacerbating neurological and cardiovascular effects. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, would worsen dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, further impairing lithium excretion.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always check lithium levels and renal function before administering lithium. Be aware of factors that can increase lithium levels, such as dehydration, sodium depletion, and certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors).",
