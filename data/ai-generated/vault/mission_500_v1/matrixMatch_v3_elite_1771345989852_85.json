The toxicity was likely precipitated by dehydration and sodium depletion from the use of an unregulated herbal diuretic. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent further harm and initiate life-saving interventions. This involves immediately withholding any further doses of lithium, protecting the client from injury (seizure precautions), initiating measures to enhance lithium excretion (IV normal saline), monitoring for life-threatening complications (cardiac monitoring), and escalating care by advocating for the definitive treatment for severe toxicity (hemodialysis).",
