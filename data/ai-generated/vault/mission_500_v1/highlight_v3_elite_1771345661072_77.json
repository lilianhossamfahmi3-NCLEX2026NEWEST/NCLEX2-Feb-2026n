Client is now minimally verbal and difficult to arouse. When awake, client is diaphoretic, disoriented, and tracks with his eyes but does not follow commands. During morning care, the unlicensed assistive personnel reported the client's arms and legs were 'stiff as a board.'\n\n### Vital Signs\n| Time | Temp (°C/°F) | HR (bpm) | RR (breaths/min) | BP (mmHg) | SpO2 (%) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 04:00 | 37.2 / 99.0 | 90 | 18 | 134/82 | 98% |\n| 08:00 | 38.6 / 101.5 | 112 | 22 | 168/98 | 95% |\n| 11:00 | 39.9 / 103.8 | 130 | 28 | 180/102 | 93% |\n\n### Laboratory Results (10:00)\n*   WBC: 16,500/mm³\n*   Potassium: 5.4 mEq/L\n*   BUN: 38 mg/dL\n*   Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL\n*   Creatine Kinase (CK): 9,500 U/L\n\n### Medication Administration Record (MAR)\n**Scheduled for 12:00:**\n*   Haloperidol 10 mg PO\n*   Lisinopril 20 mg PO\n*   Benztropine 1 mg PO",

        "correct": "The nurse must recognize the constellation of symptoms as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening emergency. The cardinal signs are severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile BP), and altered mental status. These symptoms are directly linked to the recent increase in the haloperidol dose. The massively elevated CK confirms rhabdomyolysis from muscle breakdown. Administering the next dose of haloperidol is contraindicated and would worsen this toxic state, potentially leading to renal failure, cardiac arrest, and death. The correct action is to withhold all medications, especially the antipsychotic, and immediately notify the provider.",
        "incorrect": "The distractors represent either less specific findings, expected findings from the client's history, or findings that are secondary to the primary life-threatening process. While concerning, they are not the most critical indicators that define the NMS emergency and drive the immediate action to withhold the causative agent.",
