    "correct": "The nurse must recognize the constellation of symptoms as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening emergency. The cardinal signs are severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile BP), and altered mental status. These symptoms are directly linked to the recent increase in the haloperidol dose. Haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, can cause a rapid reduction in dopamine activity in the brain, leading to hypothalamic and neuromuscular dysfunction. The resulting muscle rigidity causes increased heat production and rhabdomyolysis. The massively elevated CK confirms rhabdomyolysis from muscle breakdown. Myoglobin released from damaged muscle cells can cause acute kidney injury. Autonomic instability manifests as tachycardia and hyperthermia due to dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Administering the next dose of haloperidol is contraindicated and would worsen this toxic state, potentially leading to renal failure, cardiac arrest, and death. The correct action is to withhold all medications, especially the antipsychotic, and immediately notify the provider to initiate treatment, including dantrolene or bromocriptine, to reverse the effects of NMS.",
    "incorrect": "The distractors represent either less specific findings, expected findings from the client's history, or findings that are secondary to the primary life-threatening process. While concerning, they are not the most critical indicators that define the NMS emergency and drive the immediate action to withhold the causative agent.",
