    "correct": "The client's presentation (sudden abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, rigid uterus, fetal distress) strongly suggests placental abruption, a life-threatening condition where the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall. The vital sign changes (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) indicate hypovolemic shock due to blood loss. The lab results (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer) are indicative of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), a severe complication of placental abruption. In DIC, the body's clotting mechanisms are overactivated, leading to depletion of clotting factors and subsequent bleeding. The priority is to stabilize the mother by maximizing oxygenation to improve fetal oxygen supply and preparing for rapid fluid and blood product resuscitation to address hypovolemic shock. Monitoring urine output assesses kidney perfusion, a key indicator of organ function during shock. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial to assess fetal well-being and guide decisions regarding immediate delivery.",
    "incorrect": "Preparing for epidural analgesia is contraindicated due to the client's thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia, increasing the risk of spinal hematoma and paralysis. Tocolytics are contraindicated as they can worsen hemorrhage and mask clinical signs. While pain management is important, hemodynamic stability and end-organ perfusion take precedence. Placenta previa presents with painless, bright red bleeding, unlike the painful, dark red bleeding seen in this case. Uterine rupture often involves cessation of contractions and palpation of fetal parts, which are not present here. Amniotic fluid embolism typically presents with sudden hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy, but lacks the severe abdominal pain and rigid uterus. Magnesium sulfate is used for preeclampsia or tocolysis, neither of which are indicated in this scenario. A vaginal exam is contraindicated with vaginal bleeding until placenta previa is ruled out. Temperature and contraction frequency are less critical to monitor in this emergent situation.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The client's O2 saturation is 93%, and the fetus is showing late decelerations, indicating hypoxia. Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask maximizes oxygen delivery to both the mother and fetus. This is a critical intervention to improve fetal oxygenation and support maternal respiratory function during shock. The goal is to maintain an O2 saturation above 95%."

        "label": "B",
        "content": "Placenta Previa",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Placenta previa typically presents with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding. The client's presentation of severe abdominal pain and dark red bleeding is more consistent with placental abruption. In placenta previa, the placenta covers the cervix, leading to bleeding as the cervix dilates."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The client's rigid, tender uterus, dark red bleeding, and fetal distress are indicative of placental abruption. The vital signs show signs of hemorrhagic shock. The critically low platelets, low fibrinogen, and high D-dimer confirm DIC, a common complication of severe abruption. In placental abruption, the placenta separates prematurely from the uterine wall, leading to hemorrhage and potential fetal hypoxia. DIC is triggered by the release of tissue thromboplastin into the maternal circulation."

        "content": "Establish a second large-bore IV access.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The client is in hypovolemic shock and requires rapid fluid and blood product resuscitation. A single IV line is insufficient for the anticipated volume of fluids and blood products needed. Establishing a second large-bore IV (18-gauge or larger) allows for faster and more efficient administration of fluids and medications. This is a priority intervention to stabilize the client's hemodynamic status."

        "label": "E",
        "content": "Prepare for epidural analgesia placement.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. This is a dangerous action. The client's platelet count is <70,000/mm³ and fibrinogen is critically low, which are absolute contraindications for neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal). Proceeding with epidural placement would risk causing a spinal or epidural hematoma, leading to paralysis. The nurse must recognize this contraindication and immediately communicate this to the provider and anesthesia team. The risk of bleeding into the spinal canal is significantly increased with coagulopathy."

        "label": "F",
        "content": "Uterine Rupture",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. While uterine rupture can present with pain and fetal distress, key features are often the cessation of uterine contractions, loss of fetal station, and ability to palpate fetal parts through the abdomen. This client's uterus is rigid and tender, which is more specific to a severe abruption. Uterine rupture is a tear in the uterine wall, often occurring in women with previous uterine surgeries."

        "label": "G",
        "content": "Amniotic Fluid Embolism",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Amniotic fluid embolism typically presents with a sudden triad of hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy, but the primary trigger is often the rupture of membranes or labor itself, and it doesn't typically feature the severe, localized abdominal pain and rigid uterus seen here. Amniotic fluid embolism occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, causing a severe inflammatory response."

        "label": "H",
        "content": "Administer magnesium sulfate infusion.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia or as a tocolytic. While the client has a history of hypertension, there are no signs of imminent eclampsia, and tocolysis is contraindicated in a severe, hemodynamically unstable abruption. Magnesium sulfate can also worsen hypotension."

        "label": "I",
        "content": "Perform a sterile vaginal examination.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Performing a vaginal exam is contraindicated with vaginal bleeding until placenta previa is ruled out by ultrasound. Furthermore, it is not a priority and provides no therapeutic benefit in this emergent situation of shock and DIC. A vaginal exam could potentially worsen bleeding if a placenta previa is present."

        "label": "J",
        "content": "Continuous fetal heart rate.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The fetus is extremely vulnerable to hypoxia from uteroplacental insufficiency caused by the abruption and maternal shock. Continuous FHR monitoring is essential to assess fetal well-being and the immediate need for delivery. Fetal heart rate patterns can indicate the severity of fetal distress and guide decisions regarding the timing and mode of delivery."

      {
        "label": "K",
        "content": "Urine output.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Urine output is a critical indicator of end-organ perfusion, particularly renal perfusion. A decrease in urine output (<30 mL/hr) is one of the earliest signs that compensatory mechanisms in shock are failing. It is essential for titrating fluid resuscitation. Adequate urine output indicates that the kidneys are receiving sufficient blood flow and are functioning properly."

        "label": "L",
        "content": "Pain level on a 0-10 scale.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. While pain is a significant symptom, in the context of progressive shock and DIC, monitoring hemodynamic parameters and indicators of perfusion (urine output, FHR) takes precedence as they reflect life-threatening physiological changes. Addressing the underlying cause of the pain (hemorrhage and shock) is the priority."

        "label": "M",
        "content": "Client's temperature.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Temperature is not a primary indicator for monitoring the progression of hemorrhagic shock or DIC. The client is not at immediate risk for infection or hyperthermia. Temperature monitoring is more relevant in cases of suspected infection."
      },
      {
        "label": "N",
        "content": "Uterine contraction frequency.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. The uterus is already rigid and tender ('board-like'), making it difficult to palpate distinct contractions. Monitoring contraction frequency is less important than monitoring for signs of shock and fetal distress in this emergency. The focus should be on assessing the overall uterine tone and tenderness."
