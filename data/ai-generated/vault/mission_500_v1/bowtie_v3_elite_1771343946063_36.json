        "correct": "The clinical presentation—sudden tearing pain, rigid uterus, dark red bleeding, and fetal distress—strongly indicates a severe placental abruption. The vital signs trend (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) signifies progression into hypovolemic shock. Critically, the laboratory results (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer) are classic signs of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening complication of abruption. The nurse's priority actions are to stabilize the mother by maximizing oxygenation and preparing for massive fluid/blood product resuscitation. Monitoring focuses on organ perfusion (urine output) and fetal status (FHR), which are the most sensitive indicators of decompensation.",
        "incorrect": "The most critical 'SAFETY STOP' in this scenario is recognizing that preparing for epidural placement is contraindicated. The client's platelet count of 68,000/mm³ and low fibrinogen signify severe coagulopathy (DIC), which places her at high risk for an epidural or spinal hematoma, potentially leading to permanent paralysis. The nurse has an independent responsibility to recognize this contraindication and communicate immediately with the provider and anesthesia team. Other incorrect actions, like administering a tocolytic, are also contraindicated as they would worsen hemorrhage and mask clinical signs. Monitoring parameters like pain, while important, are secondary to assessing hemodynamic stability and end-organ perfusion.",

The vital signs show hemorrhagic shock. The lab results—critically low platelets, low fibrinogen, and high D-dimer—are the classic triad for DIC, a common sequela of severe abruption."

While uterine rupture can present with pain and fetal distress, key features are often the cessation of uterine contractions, loss of fetal station, and ability to palpate fetal parts through the abdomen.

Amniotic fluid embolism typically presents with a sudden triad of hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy, but the primary trigger is often the rupture of membranes or labor itself, and it doesn't typically feature the severe, localized abdominal pain and rigid uterus seen here."
