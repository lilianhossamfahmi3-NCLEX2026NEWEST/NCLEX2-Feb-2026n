Client is anxious and restless.\n\n<b>Time 14:45:</b> Provider performed right-sided thoracostomy, placing a 28 Fr chest tube in the 5th intercostal space. Chest tube connected to a drainage system set to -20 cm H2O suction. 20 mL of serosanguinous fluid noted in collection chamber. Small air leak observed in the water seal chamber with tidaling. Client reports pain relief to 5/10 after 4 mg IV morphine.\n\n<b>Time 15:15:</b> Client used call light. Reports sudden, severe shortness of breath and chest pain now 10/10. Client is extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and gasping for air. States, 'I can't breathe! Something is wrong!' Unilateral chest expansion noted on the left side only. Right side of chest appears distended. No tidaling or bubbling noted in chest tube drainage system."

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. The vital signs trend shows a rapid decline into obstructive shock (severe tachycardia, profound hypotension) and respiratory failure (tachypnea, severe hypoxia despite high-flow oxygen). The nurses' notes confirm this with extreme agitation, unilateral chest expansion, and a distended right chest. The sudden cessation of tidaling and bubbling in the chest tube system indicates an occlusion. The correct actions are to immediately troubleshoot the cause (assess the system), call for emergency help (RRT/provider), and anticipate the definitive life-saving intervention (needle decompression).",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options either cause direct harm or delay life-saving care. The primary 'SAFETY STOP' is recognizing that the client's agitation is a direct result of profound hypoxia and impending cardiovascular collapse, not a primary anxiety state. Sedating the client would suppress their already failing respiratory drive and lead to respiratory arrest. Treating the hypotension with fluids is incorrect because the cause is obstructive, not hypovolemic; fluids cannot fix the mechanical compression of the heart and great vessels. Increasing suction is futile if the tube is occluded and wastes critical time.",

                "explanation": "This is a life-threatening error. The client's agitation is a cardinal sign of severe hypoxia and air hunger due to the tension pneumothorax. Administering a benzodiazepine will suppress the client's respiratory drive, leading to respiratory arrest and death. The underlying physiological cause must be addressed immediately."

                "explanation": "This is a crucial and immediate independent nursing action. The sudden cessation of tidaling and bubbling strongly suggests a malfunction or occlusion (e.g., a kink in the tubing, a clot, or the client lying on the tube). Quickly identifying and resolving a simple occlusion could be life-saving. This assessment takes seconds and must be done while calling for help."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. The client's hypotension is caused by obstructive shock, not hypovolemia. The accumulating air in the pleural space is compressing the vena cava and the right side of the heart, preventing venous return (preload). A fluid bolus will not correct the mechanical obstruction and may worsen the situation by increasing pressure on the already compromised right ventricle."

A tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression to release the trapped air and restore circulation. The nurse should anticipate this by gathering the necessary equipment (large-bore needle/angiocath, antiseptic) to facilitate the procedure as soon as the provider or RRT arrives."

                "explanation": "This is an incorrect and ineffective action. If the chest tube is occluded, increasing the suction will have no effect as it cannot reach the pleural space. This action fails to address the root cause of the emergency and wastes critical time that should be spent on assessment and summoning help."
