      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. Nausea, anorexia (loss of appetite), and fatigue are classic early signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. These subjective findings are critical cues that should alert the nurse to a potential adverse drug reaction. Digoxin toxicity occurs because digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium. This disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart and affects gastrointestinal motility, causing these symptoms. Clinical Pearl: Always assess for early signs of digoxin toxicity, especially in elderly clients or those with renal impairment.",

    "opt2": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. This is a significant Social Determinant of Health (SDOH) finding that provides context for a potential dietary potassium deficiency. However, it is the resulting lab value (hypokalemia), not the social factor itself, that forms the direct contraindication. It is an important cue for analysis but not the primary clinical data point requiring immediate action. While access to fresh produce is important for overall health, it doesn't directly contraindicate digoxin administration. The hypokalemia resulting from poor diet is the direct concern. Clinical Pearl: Consider the impact of SDOH on medication management and patient outcomes.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "INCORRECT. While a blood pressure of 110/68 mmHg is on the lower end of normal and represents a slight downward trend for this client, it is not a specific or primary indicator of digoxin toxicity. The heart rate is a more direct and concerning vital sign in this context. Digoxin's primary effect on blood pressure is indirect, through its influence on cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Focus on the most direct indicators of drug toxicity when prioritizing assessment findings.",

    "opt4": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. A heart rate of 62 beats/minute, especially in the context of a downward trend, is a significant indicator of digoxin's negative chronotropic effect. An apical pulse less than 60 is a standard stop-and-notify parameter, and this value is approaching that critical threshold, contributing to the overall picture of toxicity. Digoxin slows the heart rate by increasing vagal tone and prolonging AV node conduction. This can lead to bradycardia and potentially heart block. Clinical Pearl: Always check the apical pulse before administering digoxin and hold the dose if it is below the prescribed parameter (usually 60 bpm).",

    "opt5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. This is a 'killer' lab value. Hypokalemia (normal: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L) is a critical finding because it potentiates the effect of digoxin on the heart's Na-K-ATPase pump, drastically increasing the risk of toxicity even with a therapeutic drug level. A potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L is a major contraindication to administering more digoxin. Hypokalemia increases digoxin's binding affinity to the Na-K-ATPase pump, leading to enhanced inhibition and increased intracellular calcium, which can trigger arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Monitor potassium levels closely in patients taking digoxin, especially those on diuretics.",

    },
    "opt6": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. An elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function. Since digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL (normal: ~0.6-1.2 mg/dL) signifies decreased clearance of the drug, leading to its accumulation and increasing the risk of toxicity. This is a crucial piece of the clinical puzzle. Impaired renal function reduces digoxin excretion, leading to increased serum levels and a higher risk of toxicity. Clinical Pearl: Adjust digoxin dosage based on renal function to prevent accumulation and toxicity.",

    "opt7": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "CORRECT. A digoxin level of 2.1 ng/mL is above the typical therapeutic range (0.8-2.0 ng/mL). When combined with hypokalemia, renal impairment, bradycardia, and subjective symptoms, this objectively confirms digoxin toxicity. Administering another dose would be a serious medication error. Elevated digoxin levels directly correlate with increased inhibition of the Na-K-ATPase pump, leading to the cascade of toxic effects. Clinical Pearl: Regularly monitor digoxin levels, especially when other factors that increase the risk of toxicity are present.",
