Disconnecting the client from the ventilator, which is delivering high pressures, and manually ventilating with a bag-valve-mask can be both a diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver.

The client's hypotension and oliguria are due to obstructive shock from the tension pneumothorax, which compresses the heart and great vessels, impairing venous return and cardiac output. Administering a diuretic would further deplete intravascular volume, drastically worsening the hypotension and leading to cardiovascular collapse."

Simply increasing the vasopressor without relieving the underlying obstruction (the tension pneumothorax) is a temporizing measure that will ultimately fail and delays the definitive, life-saving intervention."
