      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's condition (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, unequal chest rise, diminished breath sounds, high PIP) suggests a tension pneumothorax, a complication of high PEEP in ARDS.  A tension pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This compresses the lung, mediastinum, and great vessels, reducing venous return and cardiac output, resulting in obstructive shock.  Immediate notification ensures prompt intervention. Clinical Pearl: Always consider tension pneumothorax in ventilated patients with sudden respiratory and cardiovascular decline.",
      "pathophysiology": "Tension pneumothorax pathophysiology: Air enters pleural space, increasing pressure, collapsing lung, shifting mediastinum, compressing heart/vessels, decreasing venous return/cardiac output, leading to obstructive shock."
    },
    {
      "optionId": 2,
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. A stat portable chest x-ray is crucial for confirming a suspected pneumothorax.  While immediate intervention is paramount, radiographic confirmation guides definitive treatment. The x-ray will reveal the presence of air in the pleural space and mediastinal shift. Clinical Pearl:  Do not delay intervention for a crashing patient, but obtain imaging as soon as feasible.",
      "pathophysiology": "Chest X-ray confirms pneumothorax by visualizing air in the pleural space, lung collapse, and potential mediastinal shift due to increased intrathoracic pressure."
    },
    {
      "optionId": 3,
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression via needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube insertion.  Needle decompression converts the tension pneumothorax to a simple pneumothorax, relieving pressure on the mediastinum and improving cardiovascular function. Chest tube insertion provides continuous drainage of air and fluid, allowing the lung to re-expand. Clinical Pearl:  Be prepared to assist with or perform needle decompression if a tension pneumothorax is suspected.",
      "pathophysiology": "Needle thoracostomy releases trapped air in the pleural space, reducing pressure on the mediastinum and improving venous return and cardiac output. Chest tube facilitates continuous drainage, allowing lung re-expansion."

    {
      "optionId": 4,
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Disconnecting the client from the ventilator and manually ventilating with a bag-valve-mask can improve ventilation and oxygenation. The high pressures from the ventilator may be exacerbating the pneumothorax. Manual ventilation allows for controlled breaths and assessment of lung compliance.  The nurse will likely feel significant resistance due to the collapsed lung. Clinical Pearl:  Manual ventilation can be a temporizing measure while preparing for definitive treatment of a tension pneumothorax.",
      "pathophysiology": "Disconnecting from the ventilator reduces positive pressure exacerbating the pneumothorax. Manual ventilation allows controlled breaths and assessment of lung compliance, which will be decreased due to lung collapse."

    {
      "optionId": 5,
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. This is the 'SAFETY STOP'. The client's hypotension and oliguria are likely due to obstructive shock from the tension pneumothorax, which impairs venous return and cardiac output. Administering a diuretic would further deplete intravascular volume, worsening hypotension and potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. Clinical Pearl:  Treat the underlying cause of hypotension, not just the symptom.  In this case, the cause is the tension pneumothorax.",
      "pathophysiology": "Furosemide, a diuretic, reduces intravascular volume, exacerbating hypotension caused by decreased venous return from the tension pneumothorax, leading to further cardiovascular compromise."

    {
      "optionId": 6,
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client is pharmacologically paralyzed and sedated. The tachycardia is a compensatory response to severe hypotension and shock, not a sign of pain or agitation. Increasing sedation would be inappropriate, would not address the root cause, and could further mask the severity of the client's condition. Clinical Pearl:  Assess the underlying cause of tachycardia before administering medications.",
      "pathophysiology": "Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the setting of hypotension caused by the tension pneumothorax. Sedation will not address the underlying cause and may worsen hypotension."
    },
    {
      "optionId": 7,
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, the primary problem is mechanical obstruction of the heart and great vessels due to the tension pneumothorax, not vasodilation. Simply increasing the vasopressor without relieving the underlying obstruction is a temporizing measure that will ultimately fail and delays the definitive, life-saving intervention. Clinical Pearl:  Vasopressors are a temporizing measure in obstructive shock; definitive treatment is required.",
      "pathophysiology": "Norepinephrine increases vasoconstriction and blood pressure, but it does not address the underlying mechanical obstruction caused by the tension pneumothorax, which is compressing the heart and great vessels."
