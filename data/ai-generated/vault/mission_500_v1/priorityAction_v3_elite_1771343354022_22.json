Initial drainage 150 mL sanguineous fluid. Tidaling and gentle bubbling noted in water seal chamber. Client was alert, oriented, reporting pain 7/10. Morphine 2 mg IV administered. Upon return from CT scan, the unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) reports they had to help the client move back to the bed and may have briefly laid the drainage system on its side. Client is now extremely restless, pulling at linens, and appears agitated. No new drainage in the chest tube collection chamber for the past 30 minutes. Tidaling is now absent. Breath sounds are diminished on the left side. Trachea appears to be slightly deviated to the right."

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition. The absent tidaling, decreased breath sounds on the affected side, tracheal deviation, and sudden respiratory distress (RR 36, SpO2 85% on 4L NC, ABG showing respiratory acidosis) along with hemodynamic instability (HR 142, BP 84/52) suggest a build-up of air in the pleural space, compressing the lung and mediastinum. The UAP's report of potentially laying the drainage system on its side raises suspicion of a kink or obstruction in the chest tube. The priority action is to immediately assess the chest tube system from the insertion site to the drainage system to identify and relieve any obstruction, restoring proper drainage and alleviating the tension pneumothorax. This is the fastest and most direct intervention to address the immediate threat to the client's life.",

        "justification": "Administering a fluid bolus is contraindicated in this situation. The client's hypotension is likely due to impaired venous return caused by the compression of the great vessels in the mediastinum from the tension pneumothorax, not hypovolemia. Fluid administration could worsen pulmonary edema and further compromise respiratory function. The underlying pathophysiology is obstructive shock, not hypovolemic shock."

        "justification": "This is the priority action. The sudden cessation of tidaling and drainage, coupled with the client's rapid deterioration, strongly suggests a chest tube obstruction. Assessing the tubing for kinks, clots, or disconnections is a rapid and potentially life-saving intervention. Relieving the obstruction will allow the trapped air to escape, decompressing the lung and restoring hemodynamic stability. This addresses the root cause of the problem."

        "justification": "While increasing oxygen is important to address the client's hypoxemia, it does not address the underlying cause of the respiratory distress. The lung is being compressed by trapped air, preventing effective gas exchange. Increasing oxygen alone will not resolve the tension pneumothorax and could delay definitive treatment. This is a temporizing measure, not a solution."

The nurse should first assess the chest tube system for a simple obstruction, which can be corrected quickly. Needle decompression is a more invasive procedure performed by a provider and should be considered if the chest tube is functioning correctly and the tension pneumothorax persists. Delaying assessment of the chest tube wastes valuable time."

        "justification": "Administering morphine is contraindicated. The client's agitation is likely due to severe hypoxia and respiratory distress, not pain. Morphine, an opioid, will further depress the respiratory drive, worsen hypercapnia, and potentially lead to respiratory arrest. This could be a fatal error."
