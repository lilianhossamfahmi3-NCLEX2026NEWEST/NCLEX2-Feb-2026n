The client's presentation of sudden anxiety, throat tightness (airway compromise), flushing, pruritus, profound hypotension (88/50), tachycardia (128 bpm), tachypnea (26/min), and hypoxia (SpO2 91%) are classic signs of a severe Type I hypersensitivity reaction, or anaphylaxis, to the blood product. The ABG showing hypoxemia (PaO2 65) and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28, HCO3 18) confirms a state of shock and severe gas exchange impairment."

The onset might be less precipitous than seen here. The constellation of pruritus, flushing, and throat tightness strongly points towards an allergic/anaphylactic etiology rather than a septic one."

The absolute first priority in a suspected life-threatening transfusion reaction is to immediately stop the infusion of the offending agent (the PRBCs).

The root cause must be addressed first by stopping the transfusion. Applying oxygen should be done immediately after or concurrently with stopping the infusion."
