        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe Type I hypersensitivity reaction. The pathophysiology involves the following:\n\n*   **IgE-mediated response:** The client's immune system recognizes a protein in the transfused blood as an antigen. This triggers the production of IgE antibodies, which bind to mast cells and basophils.\n*   **Mast cell and basophil activation:** Upon subsequent exposure to the antigen, the antigen binds to the IgE antibodies on the mast cells and basophils, causing them to degranulate and release potent mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.\n*   **Systemic effects:** These mediators cause widespread vasodilation (leading to hypotension), increased capillary permeability (leading to edema and potential hypovolemic shock), bronchoconstriction (leading to airway obstruction and hypoxia), and increased mucus production. The patient's report of throat tightness, flushing, pruritus, hypotension (88/50), tachycardia (128 bpm), tachypnea (26/min), and hypoxia (SpO2 91%) are all manifestations of these systemic effects. The ABG results (pH 7.28, PaCO2 32 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 18 mEq/L) confirm respiratory compromise and metabolic acidosis due to hypoperfusion.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Anaphylactic reactions can occur rapidly, even with small amounts of the antigen. Patients with a history of allergies are at higher risk.",

        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. A febrile non-hemolytic reaction is characterized by a fever (an increase of 1°C or 2°F from baseline) and chills. It is caused by the recipient's antibodies reacting to donor leukocytes. While uncomfortable, it is not immediately life-threatening like anaphylaxis. The client's stable temperature and the presence of more severe symptoms (hypotension, airway compromise) rule out this reaction.",

      "opt1_3": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is caused by infusing blood products too quickly, leading to fluid volume overload. Signs and symptoms include hypertension, jugular venous distention, dyspnea, and pulmonary edema (crackles). The client's hypotension and clear lung sounds make TACO unlikely.",

      },
      "opt1_4": {
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Bacterial contamination of blood products can cause a septic transfusion reaction. This typically presents with high fever, chills, hypotension, and possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While hypotension is present in this case, the rapid onset of airway compromise and pruritus are more indicative of anaphylaxis.",

The nurse should then disconnect the blood tubing from the IV catheter and replace it with new IV tubing connected to 0.9% normal saline. This maintains venous access for administering emergency medications. Continuing the transfusion would exacerbate the reaction and could lead to death.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Remember the mnemonic **STOP** for suspected transfusion reactions: **S**top the transfusion, **T**ake vital signs, **O**xygenate the patient, **P**rescribe/Prepare medications (e.g., epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids).",
