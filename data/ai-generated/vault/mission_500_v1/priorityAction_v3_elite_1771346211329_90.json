  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client's clinical presentation (hypertension, headache, epigastric pain, visual disturbances) and laboratory results (thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes) are indicative of HELLP syndrome, a severe form of preeclampsia. HELLP syndrome involves Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. The critically low platelet count (45,000/mm³) poses a significant risk for bleeding. Ketorolac, an NSAID, inhibits platelet aggregation, further increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Administering ketorolac could lead to life-threatening complications such as subcapsular liver hematoma rupture or intracranial hemorrhage. The priority is to withhold the contraindicated medication and immediately notify the healthcare provider to discuss alternative pain management strategies that do not compromise the client's already impaired clotting ability. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm and addresses the most immediate threat to the client's life.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either directly harmful or fail to address the most urgent, life-threatening problem. Administering ketorolac is a catastrophic error. While assessing for magnesium toxicity and administering betamethasone are important components of care for this client, they are not the priority over preventing a massive hemorrhage from a contraindicated medication. The core of safe nursing practice is identifying and stopping actions that will cause immediate harm.",

        "justification": "This is the most dangerous action. Ketorolac, an NSAID, inhibits platelet aggregation. In a client with HELLP syndrome and a critically low platelet count of 45,000/mm³, administering ketorolac would significantly increase the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage, such as a subcapsular liver hematoma rupture or intracranial bleed. This action could be fatal. Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 are considered critically low and increase the risk of spontaneous bleeding."

        "content": "Prepare to administer the scheduled dose of betamethasone.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Betamethasone is administered to promote fetal lung maturity in anticipation of preterm delivery. While important, maternal stabilization is the absolute priority in HELLP syndrome. Delaying betamethasone briefly to address the immediate risk of hemorrhage from a contraindicated medication is the safer course of action. The safety issue must be resolved first. Betamethasone does not address the immediate threat to the mother's life."

        "content": "Assess the client’s deep tendon reflexes and respiratory status.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Assessing deep tendon reflexes and respiratory status is crucial for monitoring magnesium sulfate toxicity. However, the EHR data reveals a life-threatening contraindication in the MAR (ketorolac) given the client's thrombocytopenia. The priority is to prevent the iatrogenic harm of administering the contraindicated drug, not to perform a routine assessment. While important, this assessment does not address the immediate risk of hemorrhage. Magnesium sulfate toxicity can lead to respiratory depression and loss of DTRs, but preventing hemorrhage takes precedence."

        "content": "Withhold the ketorolac and notify the healthcare provider of the laboratory results.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the correct priority action. The nurse recognizes the critical safety risk by synthesizing the laboratory data (platelets 45,000/mm³) with the MAR (PRN ketorolac). The fundamental principle of 'do no harm' requires the nurse to act as a safety net, withhold the medication, and communicate the rationale and critical findings to the provider for a new, safer pain management plan. This prevents potential life-threatening complications associated with HELLP syndrome and thrombocytopenia. Prompt communication ensures timely intervention and appropriate management."

Prioritize maternal stabilization before other interventions, such as administering betamethasone. Always double-check medication orders against lab results and patient conditions, especially platelet counts, to prevent potentially fatal medication errors. Epigastric pain in a pregnant client with hypertension should raise suspicion for HELLP syndrome or liver capsule distension/rupture."
