The platelet count of 45,000/mm³ indicates critical thrombocytopenia. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that functions as a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Administering ketorolac to this client would severely impair the already limited clotting ability, creating a high risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. This could manifest as a subcapsular liver hematoma rupture (heralded by the severe epigastric pain) or an intracranial bleed (a risk with the severe headache and hypertension). The nurse's highest priority is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the dangerous medication, and immediately escalate to the provider. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm and addresses the most immediate threat to the client's life.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either directly harmful or fail to address the most urgent, life-threatening problem. Administering ketorolac is a catastrophic error. While assessing for magnesium toxicity and administering betamethasone are important components of care for this client, they are not the priority over preventing a massive hemorrhage from a contraindicated medication. The core of safe nursing practice is identifying and stopping actions that will cause immediate harm.",

Ketorolac inhibits platelet function, which would exacerbate the bleeding risk in a client who is already severely thrombocytopenic and at risk for liver rupture or stroke. This action could be fatal."

The nurse correctly synthesizes the laboratory data (platelets 45,000/mm³) with the MAR (PRN ketorolac) to identify a critical safety risk. The fundamental principle of 'do no harm' requires the nurse to act as a safety net, withhold the medication, and communicate the rationale and critical findings to the provider for a new, safer pain management plan."
