        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation is a classic, late-stage sign of severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) known as Cushing's Triad. This triad consists of: 1) Systolic hypertension with a widening pulse pressure (190/82 mmHg, pulse pressure of 108), 2) Bradycardia (HR 52 bpm), and 3) Irregular, decreased respirations (RR 10/min). This triad, combined with the decreased GCS, unilateral pupillary change, and CT scan showing a large epidural hematoma with midline shift, indicates the client is on the verge of brain herniation. The nurse's highest priority is to implement measures to decrease ICP and prevent this catastrophic event. Withholding the prescribed hypotonic 0.45% NaCl infusion is a critical 'SAFETY STOP' action, as this fluid would shift from the intravascular space into the brain cells, dramatically worsening cerebral edema and accelerating herniation. Preparing for Mannitol administration is a correct immediate action to osmotically draw fluid out of the brain tissue. Monitoring GCS and pupillary response provides the most direct assessment of brainstem function and neurological deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect actions either fail to address the life-threatening ICP or are actively harmful. Administering a hypotonic IV solution is a lethal error in this context. Preparing for a lumbar puncture is absolutely contraindicated as the rapid pressure change could cause brainstem herniation. Encouraging deep coughing would spike ICP. The incorrect monitoring parameters (urine output, temperature), while relevant to overall neuro care, are not the most critical indicators of impending herniation compared to direct neurological assessments like GCS and pupillary changes.",
