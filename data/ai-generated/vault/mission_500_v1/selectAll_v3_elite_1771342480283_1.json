        "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from multiple sources to identify several absolute contraindications to alteplase administration, which is a high-risk, time-sensitive therapy. The primary goal is to prevent the conversion of an ischemic stroke into a life-threatening hemorrhagic stroke. In this scenario, four 'STOP' signals are present: the time of symptom onset is outside the established therapeutic window, the blood pressure remains dangerously elevated despite intervention, the INR is supratherapeutic, and the platelet count is below the minimum threshold for safe administration. Recognizing any of these requires the nurse to halt the administration process and immediately notify the provider.",
        "incorrect": "The point-of-care glucose is elevated, which is common in acute stroke due to the stress response. While it should be managed, a level of 195 mg/dL is not an absolute contraindication to alteplase. The non-contrast head CT finding is actually a prerequisite for alteplase administration; it confirms the absence of hemorrhage, which is the primary purpose of the scan before giving a thrombolytic. The 'early ischemic changes' are an expected finding in a stroke, not a contraindication.",

                "justification": "This is a critical contraindication. The client was 'last seen normal' at 08:00 and arrived at 13:00, which is a 5-hour timeframe. The standard window for alteplase administration is 3 to 4.5 hours from the last known normal time. Administering alteplase outside this window significantly increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage without proven benefit."

                "justification": "This is a critical contraindication. Alteplase administration requires blood pressure to be consistently below 185/110 mmHg to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Despite one dose of IV labetalol, the client's blood pressure remains elevated above this critical threshold. The nurse cannot proceed until the blood pressure is controlled."
