This is evidenced by hypotension (MAP 62 mmHg), tachycardia (124 bpm), tachypnea (28/min), altered mental status (confusion), poor perfusion (cool/clammy skin, weak pulses, slow capillary refill, decreased urine output), elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L), and pulmonary congestion (bibasilar crackles, S3). The priority is to support hemodynamics, withhold medications that worsen shock, and escalate care.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either worsen the shock state, are not the immediate priority, or are contraindicated.

        "justification": "Correct. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that decreases heart rate and contractility (negative inotrope and chronotrope). In cardiogenic shock, the heart is already struggling. Administering metoprolol would further reduce cardiac output and worsen hypotension, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. This is a 'DON'T PROCEED' scenario. The nurse must recognize the contraindication. Pathophysiology: Cardiogenic shock results from the heart's inability to pump effectively, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Beta-blockers exacerbate this by reducing myocardial contractility and heart rate.",

Giving a beta-blocker to a client with a MAP of 62 mmHg, severe tachycardia, and signs of cardiogenic shock would severely worsen pump failure, leading to a life-threatening outcome. Pathophysiology: Beta-blockers decrease sympathetic nervous system stimulation of the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility.

The nurse must act on this order to increase vasoconstriction and improve blood pressure, thereby supporting vital organ perfusion. Pathophysiology: Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance, leading to increased blood pressure and improved organ perfusion. In cardiogenic shock, vasopressors are often necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure to perfuse vital organs.",

Furosemide is a diuretic that reduces preload. In a hemodynamically unstable client, aggressive diuresis can further decrease preload, reduce cardiac output, and worsen hypotension. Blood pressure must be stabilized before considering diuresis. Pathophysiology: Furosemide reduces blood volume by promoting diuresis. In cardiogenic shock, preload is often reduced due to impaired venous return and decreased cardiac output. Further reducing preload with a diuretic can worsen hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion.",

The client's life is threatened by hemodynamic collapse. The priority actions are stabilizing blood pressure, withholding harmful medications, and notifying the provider. The antiplatelets can be administered once the life-threatening shock state has been addressed. Pathophysiology: Aspirin and clopidogrel inhibit platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of thrombus formation. While important for long-term management post-PCI, they do not directly address the immediate hemodynamic instability of cardiogenic shock.",

The provider must be notified immediately to direct further advanced interventions, which may include escalating to additional vasopressors, initiating inotropic support (e.g., dobutamine), or considering mechanical circulatory support (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pump, Impella device).
