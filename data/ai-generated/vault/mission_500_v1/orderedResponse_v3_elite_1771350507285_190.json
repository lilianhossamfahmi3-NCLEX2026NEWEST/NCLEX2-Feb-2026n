    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of severe lithium toxicity (serum level 2.8 mEq/L), including confusion, coarse tremors, ataxia, and vomiting. This is a medical emergency. The toxicity was likely precipitated by the recent addition of lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and compounded by volume depletion (vomiting, hypotension) and hyponatremia, all of which decrease renal clearance of lithium. Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and ACE inhibitors can reduce renal blood flow, leading to decreased lithium clearance and increased serum levels. Volume depletion further concentrates lithium in the blood, exacerbating the toxicity. Hyponatremia causes the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium and lithium, as lithium is handled similarly to sodium in the kidneys. The prolonged QTc interval on the ECG indicates a disruption in the heart's electrical repolarization, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes. The priority actions follow a logical sequence: first, stop the cause of the harm; second, assess for and prevent immediate life-threatening complications; third, communicate for further orders; and finally, prepare to implement treatment. \n1. Withholding the lithium is the absolute first priority to prevent worsening the toxicity. This is a critical 'STOP' action. \n2. Placing the client on a cardiac monitor is the next priority, as the ECG shows QTc prolongation, indicating a high risk for fatal arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes. \n3. Implementing seizure precautions is third, as severe neurotoxicity (confusion, ataxia) places the client at high risk for seizures. \n4. Notifying the HCP is crucial for collaborative management and to obtain orders for treatment. \n5. Preparing for IV fluids is the final step in this sequence, as it is a dependent action to treat the dehydration and enhance lithium excretion, which will be ordered by the HCP.",

        "justification": "This is the highest priority. The client's lithium level is 2.8 mEq/L, which is severe toxicity. Administering more lithium would be life-threatening. This is the critical 'DON'T PROCEED' step that stops the progression of the toxic state. Lithium toxicity can rapidly escalate, leading to severe neurological and cardiovascular complications. Immediate cessation is crucial to prevent further accumulation and damage."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "This is the second priority. Lithium toxicity can cause severe cardiotoxicity. The ECG already shows a prolonged QTc interval, putting the client at immediate risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring is essential for early detection and intervention (ABCs). Lithium affects cardiac ion channels, prolonging repolarization and increasing the susceptibility to arrhythmias. Early detection allows for prompt treatment with medications like magnesium sulfate or temporary pacing."

        "justification": "This is the third priority. The client's neurological status (confusion, ataxia, coarse tremors) indicates significant neurotoxicity. At this level of toxicity, seizures and coma are imminent risks. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside) is a critical independent nursing action to ensure patient safety. Lithium-induced neurotoxicity can disrupt neuronal excitability, leading to seizures. Proactive measures minimize the risk of injury during a seizure."

        "justification": "This is the fourth priority. While essential, direct patient safety interventions (stopping the offending agent, cardiac monitoring, seizure precautions) take precedence. The nurse must take immediate action to stabilize the client before communicating. The SBAR report to the HCP will include the critical lab, ECG, and assessment findings to obtain orders for definitive treatment (e.g., IV fluids, hemodialysis). Prompt communication ensures timely medical intervention and prevents further deterioration."

        "justification": "This is the last priority in this sequence. Rehydration with isotonic saline is a key treatment to correct volume depletion and enhance renal excretion of lithium. However, this is a dependent nursing action that requires an HCP order. The nurse should anticipate this order and prepare, but it can only be implemented after the HCP has been notified and prescribed the intervention. IV fluids help restore renal perfusion and promote lithium excretion. Normal saline is preferred to avoid electrolyte imbalances."

Volume depletion (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea) and hyponatremia also increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Early signs of lithium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tremors. Severe toxicity can lead to confusion, ataxia, seizures, coma, and cardiac arrhythmias. QTc prolongation is a serious complication of lithium toxicity and can lead to Torsades de Pointes.
