    "correct": "The client's clinical presentation—pain out of proportion to injury and unrelieved by opioids, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness (faint), and pressure—are classic signs of acute compartment syndrome (ACS). The delay in seeking care is a significant risk factor. The laboratory results confirm a life-threatening systemic complication: rhabdomyolysis (CK > 45,000) leading to severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.2) and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr). The hyperkalemia poses an immediate risk for fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The elevated lactate indicates profound tissue ischemia. The only appropriate actions are to prepare for the definitive treatment to save the limb (emergent fasciotomy) and to implement immediate safety measures for the life-threatening complications (continuous cardiac monitoring for hyperkalemia).\n\n**SBAR Communication (15:15):**\n*   **Situation:** 34-year-old male admitted with right tibia/fibula fracture, now exhibiting signs of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) and rhabdomyolysis.\n*   **Background:** Fell from ladder, long leg cast applied in ED. Waited >24 hrs for care. Pain 10/10 unrelieved by morphine, tight pressure, diminished sensation, cool/pale foot, faint pulses.\n*   **Assessment:** Suspect ACS and rhabdomyolysis. K+ 6.2, CK 45,000, BUN 35, Creatinine 2.1, Lactate 4.8. HR 124, RR 24. High risk for cardiac dysrhythmia and kidney failure.\n*   **Recommendation:** STAT surgical consult for emergent fasciotomy. Continuous cardiac monitoring. Immediate interventions for hyperkalemia (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose). Prepare for potential dialysis.",
    "incorrect": "Actions that are contraindicated would actively harm the client. Administering more opioids would mask the cardinal symptom of ACS, providing a false sense of reassurance and delaying definitive treatment. Elevating the limb is a critical error; in ACS, elevation reduces arterial inflow, worsening ischemia and accelerating tissue death. The limb should be kept at the level of the heart. Applying ice is also contraindicated as it causes vasoconstriction, further impairing already compromised circulation. Non-essential actions, while potentially appropriate in other contexts, are incorrect because they fail to address the immediate life-and-limb-threatening priorities.",
