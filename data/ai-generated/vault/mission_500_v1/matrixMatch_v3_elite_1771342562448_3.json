        "correct": "This client is exhibiting classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency common in individuals with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury, causing an imbalanced sympathetic nervous system response. This leads to profound vasoconstriction below the injury level, resulting in severe hypertension. The body attempts to compensate via the parasympathetic system above the injury level, causing bradycardia, vasodilation (flushing, diaphoresis), and nasal congestion. The primary nursing goals are to lower the blood pressure and eliminate the noxious stimulus immediately.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either worsen the client's condition or delay critical, life-saving interventions. Administering a beta-blocker to a client who is already severely bradycardic is a critical safety error that could lead to cardiovascular collapse. Placing the client flat or in Trendelenburg would exacerbate the already dangerously high blood pressure. Non-essential actions, while potentially useful later, are not the immediate priority in this emergency situation.",

                "justification": "This is the first and most critical independent nursing action. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position utilizes gravity (orthostatic hypotension) to help immediately lower cerebral blood pressure and reduce the risk of a hypertensive stroke while other interventions are initiated."

                "justification": "The most common cause of AD (in over 85% of cases) is a noxious stimulus from the bladder, such as distention from a blocked catheter. Immediately assessing for and correcting this issue (e.g., unkinking tubing, irrigating for a blockage) is a priority action to remove the trigger and resolve the AD episode."

                "justification": "This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' / 'SAFETY STOP' moment. The client's heart rate is dangerously low (46 bpm) due to the parasympathetic response in AD. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that will further decrease the heart rate and contractility, potentially leading to severe bradycardia, heart block, or asystole. This action is absolutely contraindicated and life-threatening."

While searching for the cause, pharmacological intervention is necessary if the BP does not decrease rapidly with non-pharmacological measures. Hydralazine is a rapid-acting vasodilator appropriate for this situation. The nurse should prepare it for immediate administration per the provider's order."

                "justification": "This action is extremely dangerous and would dramatically worsen the client's condition. The Trendelenburg position would increase blood flow to the head, further elevating the already critically high blood pressure and increasing the risk of cerebral hemorrhage or seizure."
