    "correct": "The correct action is to withhold the furosemide and immediately notify the provider. The client is exhibiting signs of worsening cardiogenic shock, evidenced by increasing tachycardia (HR 126 bpm), hypotension (BP 78/52 mmHg, MAP 61 mmHg) despite norepinephrine, elevated lactate (4.8 mmol/L) indicating tissue hypoperfusion, and acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated BUN (48 mg/dL), creatinine (2.9 mg/dL), and severely decreased urine output (<10 mL/hr). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes fluid excretion by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle within the kidneys. However, its effectiveness depends on adequate renal perfusion and function. In cardiogenic shock, decreased cardiac output leads to reduced renal blood flow, causing AKI. Administering furosemide in this state is not only ineffective due to impaired renal function but also potentially harmful. It can worsen hypovolemia, further compromise renal perfusion, and lead to electrolyte imbalances and ototoxicity. The nurse's priority is to recognize the contraindication, prevent harm by withholding the medication, and promptly inform the provider to re-evaluate the treatment plan and address the underlying shock and AKI.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options reflect a failure to recognize the severity of the client's condition and the contraindication for furosemide administration. They also demonstrate a lack of prioritization in addressing the most immediate life-threatening issue.",

        "justification": "This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. While the client has pulmonary edema (crackles), the primary problem is cardiogenic shock and AKI. Furosemide requires adequate renal function to be effective. In the presence of AKI and hypoperfusion, furosemide will not produce diuresis and can worsen hypovolemia and renal function. Administering it could exacerbate the client's condition and cause further harm."

        "justification": "While increasing the norepinephrine infusion might be considered to improve blood pressure and MAP, it is not the priority action. The nurse's immediate concern should be preventing harm by withholding the contraindicated furosemide. Addressing the medication error takes precedence over adjusting the vasopressor infusion. The provider should be notified of the client's overall condition, including the need for potential vasopressor adjustments, after the furosemide issue is addressed."

The client's worsening vital signs, elevated lactate, and signs of AKI (elevated BUN/creatinine, decreased urine output) indicate that furosemide is contraindicated. Administering furosemide in this situation could worsen hypovolemia and further compromise renal function. Withholding the medication prevents potential harm, and notifying the provider allows for a timely re-evaluation of the treatment plan."

        "justification": "While the client's potassium is slightly low (3.4 mEq/L), addressing this is not the priority. The primary concern is the client's cardiogenic shock and AKI, which contraindicate furosemide administration. Focusing solely on the potassium level distracts from the more critical issue of preventing harm from a contraindicated medication. Addressing the potassium level can be considered after the immediate threat of worsening shock and AKI is addressed."
