Client reports running out of his prescribed furosemide and lisinopril a week ago, stating he \"had to choose between the medication and groceries this month.\" He appears anxious and restless. Skin is cool to the touch and diaphoretic. Coarse crackles auscultated in bilateral lower lung bases. 2+ pitting edema noted in lower extremities. Urine output via indwelling catheter 40 mL in the last 2 hours."

This requires prioritizing the 'Don't Proceed' safety action over treating the symptomatic tachycardia.",
