While the acute subdural hematoma is the underlying pathology and the headache is a significant symptom, these findings do not represent the immediate threat of brain herniation as directly as the vital sign changes. The hematoma is the *cause*, but Cushing's triad indicates the *effect* of life-threatening increased ICP.",

Widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations constitute Cushing's triad, a late and ominous sign of severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and impending brain herniation. This reflects the brainstem's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of escalating pressure. The hypertension increases mean arterial pressure (MAP) to force blood into the brain, while bradycardia is a reflex response to the hypertension. Irregular respirations result from pressure on the brainstem's respiratory centers.",

Rapidly lowering the blood pressure with Labetalol could drastically reduce CPP, leading to cerebral ischemia, worsening herniation, and potentially death.
