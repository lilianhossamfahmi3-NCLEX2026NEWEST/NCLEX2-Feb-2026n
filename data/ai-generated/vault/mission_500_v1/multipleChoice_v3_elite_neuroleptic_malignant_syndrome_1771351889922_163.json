The key features present are hyperthermia (fever >40°C), severe muscle rigidity ('lead pipe'), altered mental status, and autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile blood pressure, tachypnea, diaphoresis). Laboratory results confirm this diagnosis with a massively elevated Creatine Kinase (CK) from rhabdomyolysis, leukocytosis, and evidence of acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Creatinine). The causative agent is the recently started risperidone. The absolute priority in managing NMS is to immediately discontinue the offending drug.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. While treating the hyperthermia is a component of NMS management, it is not the immediate priority. The fever in NMS is centrally mediated and often unresponsive to standard antipyretics like acetaminophen. The priority is to stop the cause of the syndrome, which is the antipsychotic medication."

                "rationale": "Correct. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The client is exhibiting all the hallmark signs of NMS, a medical emergency directly caused by the risperidone. Continuing to administer the causative agent would be catastrophic and would worsen the hypermetabolic state, leading to further muscle breakdown, renal failure, and cardiovascular collapse. Withholding the drug and notifying the provider for orders for supportive care (e.g., dantrolene, bromocriptine, IV fluids, cooling measures) is the life-saving priority."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's altered mental status, hypoxia, and metabolic derangements do place them at risk for seizures. Implementing seizure precautions and monitoring oxygenation are appropriate supportive nursing actions. However, they are secondary interventions. The primary, life-saving action is to address the root cause by stopping the offending medication."

                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. This is a dangerous action that misinterprets a medical emergency as a primary psychiatric problem. The client's altered mental status and agitation are symptoms of NMS, not a worsening of their underlying dementia-related psychosis. Involving psychiatry without first addressing the medical crisis would delay essential treatment and could lead to the erroneous and potentially fatal recommendation of administering more antipsychotic medication."
