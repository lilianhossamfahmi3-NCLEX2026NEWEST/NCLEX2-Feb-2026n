        "correct": "The correct response is to first **stop the insulin infusion and notify the provider** because the **serum potassium of 2.4 mEq/L with ECG changes** poses the greatest immediate risk. The client's clinical picture indicates severe, life-threatening hypokalemia. Insulin therapy drives potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, which has caused the client's initially borderline potassium (3.5 mEq/L) to drop to a critical level (2.4 mEq/L). The ECG findings of flattened T-waves and prominent U-waves are classic signs of severe hypokalemia and indicate myocardial instability. Continuing, and especially increasing, the insulin infusion would exacerbate the hypokalemia, potentially inducing fatal cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, the priority and safest action is to immediately stop the agent causing the potassium shift (insulin), and urgently contact the provider for orders for aggressive intravenous potassium replacement. Standard DKA protocols are contraindicated when serum potassium is less than 3.3 mEq/L; this client is well below that threshold.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they fail to address the immediate life-threatening condition. Increasing the insulin based on the glucose level would be catastrophic. Administering potassium is a necessary subsequent action, but the *first* action is to stop the causative agent (insulin). Waiting for a potassium order before stopping the insulin unnecessarily prolongs the period of extreme cardiac risk. Addressing the still-present acidosis with bicarbonate or focusing on the glucose or blood pressure would ignore the imminent threat of cardiac arrest from hypokalemia.",

Although the glucose has not fallen by 50-75 mg/dL per hour, the presence of critical hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) and associated ECG changes is an absolute contraindication to administering more insulin. This action would worsen hypokalemia and likely precipitate a lethal arrhythmia."

Bicarbonate administration is controversial in DKA and typically reserved for severe, life-threatening acidosis (pH < 6.9), which is not indicated here.

A potassium level below 2.5 mEq/L is critically low and associated with a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory muscle weakness, and ileus.
