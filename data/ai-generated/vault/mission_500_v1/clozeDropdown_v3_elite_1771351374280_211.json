    "correct": "The correct response is to first **stop the insulin infusion and notify the provider** because the **serum potassium of 2.4 mEq/L with ECG changes** poses the greatest immediate risk. In DKA, hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, causing electrolyte losses, including potassium. Insulin administration further exacerbates hypokalemia by driving potassium intracellularly. The client's initial potassium of 3.5 mEq/L has dropped to a critically low 2.4 mEq/L, and the ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U-waves) indicate significant myocardial instability. Continuing the insulin infusion would worsen the hypokalemia, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, the priority is to immediately stop the insulin infusion, the causative agent, and notify the provider for urgent potassium replacement. DKA protocols are contraindicated when serum potassium is less than 3.3 mEq/L.",
    "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they fail to address the immediate life-threatening hypokalemia. Increasing the insulin infusion would be catastrophic. Administering potassium is necessary but *after* stopping the insulin. Waiting for a potassium order before stopping the insulin prolongs the cardiac risk. Addressing the acidosis or blood pressure ignores the imminent threat of cardiac arrest.",

        "justification": "Increasing the insulin infusion rate is contraindicated due to the client's severe hypokalemia. Insulin drives potassium into cells, further lowering serum potassium levels and increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. This action would be detrimental to the client's cardiac stability. **Clinical Pearl:** Always check potassium levels before initiating or increasing insulin infusions in DKA."

        "justification": "This is the priority action. The insulin infusion is contributing to the worsening hypokalemia. Stopping the infusion is the most critical independent nursing action to prevent further potassium shift and potential cardiac arrest. Notifying the provider ensures prompt intervention with potassium replacement. **Clinical Pearl:** In DKA management, always prioritize addressing electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia, before focusing solely on hyperglycemia."

        "justification": "While potassium administration is urgently needed, the question assumes there is no current order for it, or if there is, the *first* action is to remove the offending agent. Stopping the insulin infusion must be done immediately and can be done independently, while administering a medication requires an active order. The primary nursing action is to stop the process that is actively harming the client. **Clinical Pearl:** Remember the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Hypokalemia significantly impacts cardiac function (circulation) and can lead to respiratory muscle weakness (airway/breathing)."

        "justification": "The client's acidosis is improving (bicarbonate has risen from 8 to 14) with fluid and insulin therapy. Bicarbonate administration is controversial in DKA and typically reserved for severe, life-threatening acidosis (pH < 6.9), which is not indicated here. Furthermore, administering bicarbonate can also worsen hypokalemia, making it a dangerous choice in this context. **Clinical Pearl:** Bicarbonate administration in DKA is generally avoided unless the acidosis is extremely severe due to potential complications like paradoxical CNS acidosis and worsening hypokalemia."

Prioritizing the hyperglycemia over the critical hypokalemia is a life-threatening error. **Clinical Pearl:** In DKA, address the most immediate threats first. Electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia, can be fatal if not corrected promptly."

        "justification": "This is the correct rationale. A potassium level below 2.5 mEq/L is critically low and associated with a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory muscle weakness, and ileus. The presence of confirmatory ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U-waves) indicates myocardial irritability and elevates this finding to the highest priority, representing an immediate threat to life (Airway, Breathing, *Cardiac/Circulation*). **Clinical Pearl:** ECG changes are crucial indicators of the severity of hypokalemia.

It is a positive finding and not the reason for taking urgent, life-saving action. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor trends in bicarbonate levels to assess the effectiveness of DKA treatment.

This indicates a positive response to fluid resuscitation. It is not the most critical finding when compared to the risk of imminent cardiac arrest. **Clinical Pearl:** Hypotension in DKA is often due to dehydration.
