        "correct": "The client's updated data reveals a critical drop in serum potassium to 2.4 mEq/L, accompanied by ECG changes (flattened T-waves, U-waves, PVCs) indicative of severe hypokalemia and cardiac instability. This is a life-threatening complication of HHS treatment. Insulin drives potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, and fluid resuscitation can cause dilutional hypokalemia. The initial 'normal' potassium of 3.6 mEq/L was misleading, as it masked a significant total body potassium deficit due to osmotic diuresis. The immediate priorities are to (1) stop the intervention causing the electrolyte shift (the insulin infusion) to prevent further worsening of hypokalemia, and (2) immediately notify the provider to obtain orders for aggressive intravenous potassium replacement. Delaying these actions places the client at imminent risk for fatal cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options either fail to address the life-threatening hypokalemia, worsen it, or introduce a new error. Increasing the insulin infusion is the most dangerous action as it would accelerate the intracellular potassium shift and likely precipitate a cardiac arrest. Increasing saline without potassium replacement does not address the primary problem. Administering dextrose is inappropriate for a hyperglycemic state and would be a medication error. Delaying action by documenting and waiting is unsafe given the critical lab value and ECG changes, which represent a medical emergency.",

The nurse must stop this infusion immediately as an independent nursing action to prevent further harm."
