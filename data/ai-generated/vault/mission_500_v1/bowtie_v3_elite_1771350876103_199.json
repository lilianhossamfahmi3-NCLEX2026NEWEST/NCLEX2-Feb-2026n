    "correct": "The client is at highest risk for hemorrhagic conversion due to uncontrolled hypertension. Alteplase (tPA) is contraindicated with a BP >185/110 mmHg. Despite labetalol administration at 0830, the BP at 0845 remains elevated at 198/108 mmHg. The nurse must withhold alteplase and notify the provider immediately. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of bleeding into the infarcted area of the brain after tPA administration. Continuous monitoring of BP and neurological status is crucial to detect any changes. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Ischemic stroke causes damage to the blood-brain barrier. Alteplase, a thrombolytic, dissolves clots but also increases the risk of bleeding. In the presence of uncontrolled hypertension, the pressure within the cerebral vessels is elevated, increasing the likelihood of vessel rupture and hemorrhagic conversion. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always check BP before administering tPA. If BP is elevated, follow stroke protocol to lower BP to <185/110 mmHg before tPA administration.",
