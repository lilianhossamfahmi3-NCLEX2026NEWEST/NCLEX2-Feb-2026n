The constellation of new-onset severe headache, mental fogginess, nausea, severe hypertension, and bradycardia (Cushing's reflex) is alarming. In a client with a very high BUN (142 mg/dL), this presentation is highly suggestive of evolving, severe Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS), which involves cerebral edema. Initiating hemodialysis would rapidly decrease the serum osmolality by removing urea, creating an osmotic gradient that pulls fluid into the brain, catastrophically worsening cerebral edema and potentially leading to seizure, coma, or brainstem herniation. The only safe course of action is to immediately stop the planned procedure and urgently notify the provider for a change in plan, which may include admission for neurological assessment and a much gentler form of renal replacement therapy if needed.",
