The laboratory results confirm this with massive rhabdomyolysis (CK > 15,000 U/L), leukocytosis, and acute kidney injury from myoglobinuria. NMS is a medical emergency. The absolute first and most critical nursing action is to recognize this syndrome and immediately withhold the offending agent (haloperidol). Any delay or further administration of the drug would be fatal. Notifying the provider is the immediate next step to initiate emergency supportive care (e.g., ICU transfer, cooling measures, dantrolene or bromocriptine administration).",
