        "rationale": "This is the highest priority action. The client's clinical picture (tense, distended abdomen, rising peak inspiratory pressures, decreasing MAP and urine output despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, elevated lactate) strongly suggests the development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) progressing to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS is a life-threatening condition where increased pressure within the abdominal cavity compromises organ perfusion and respiratory function. The pathophysiology involves the compression of abdominal vasculature, leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output, as well as impaired renal and splanchnic perfusion. The elevated peak inspiratory pressures are due to the diaphragm being pushed upwards, restricting lung expansion. Continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation will exacerbate IAH and ACS, leading to further organ damage and potential cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, the immediate priority is to halt the fluid infusion to prevent further increases in intra-abdominal pressure.",
        "clinicalPearl": "In burn patients receiving large-volume fluid resuscitation, be vigilant for signs of IAH/ACS. Monitor abdominal distension, respiratory parameters (peak inspiratory pressure), urine output, and hemodynamic status closely. Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent life-threatening complications. Remember the 'safety stop' when the patient's condition deviates from the expected response to fluid resuscitation.",

        "rationale": "After pausing the fluid resuscitation, the next priority is to objectively assess the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to confirm the diagnosis of IAH/ACS. Measuring bladder pressure via the indwelling urinary catheter is a non-invasive and reliable method to estimate IAP. Elevated IAP levels (typically >20 mmHg with organ dysfunction) confirm the diagnosis of ACS. This measurement provides crucial data to guide further interventions and assess the effectiveness of treatment. The pathophysiology behind using bladder pressure as an indicator of IAP relies on the fact that the bladder wall is compliant and transmits pressure changes within the abdominal cavity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Bladder pressure monitoring is a simple and effective method for assessing IAP. Ensure proper technique, including zeroing the transducer at the level of the symphysis pubis and using a standardized volume of saline (e.g., 25 mL) to instill into the bladder. Consistent and accurate monitoring is essential for timely diagnosis and management of IAH/ACS.",

        "rationale": "Once IAH/ACS is suspected or confirmed, prompt notification of the burn surgeon and respiratory therapist is essential for timely intervention. The burn surgeon needs to evaluate the client for potential surgical decompression, such as escharotomy or laparotomy. The respiratory therapist is crucial for managing the client's respiratory status, as ACS can significantly impair lung function and increase the risk of barotrauma. The pathophysiology involves the upward displacement of the diaphragm, leading to decreased lung compliance, increased airway pressures, and impaired gas exchange. Collaboration between the surgical and respiratory teams is critical for optimizing the client's care and preventing further complications.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Effective communication and collaboration are paramount in managing ACS. Provide the surgical and respiratory teams with a concise and accurate report of the client's clinical status, including vital signs, laboratory results, and IAP measurements. Early involvement of these specialists can significantly improve patient outcomes.",

        "rationale": "This action anticipates the definitive treatment for ACS. Circumferential torso burns can restrict chest wall expansion, contributing to respiratory compromise. An escharotomy (surgical incision through the eschar) can release this constriction and improve ventilation. However, if IAH/ACS persists despite escharotomy, a decompressive laparotomy (surgical opening of the abdominal cavity) may be necessary to relieve pressure on abdominal organs and improve perfusion. The pathophysiology behind decompressive laparotomy involves reducing the pressure on abdominal vasculature, improving venous return, and restoring organ perfusion. The nurse's role in preparing the client includes ensuring informed consent (if possible), gathering necessary equipment, and coordinating with the surgical team.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Decompressive laparotomy is a life-saving procedure for ACS. Prompt preparation and coordination are essential for a successful outcome. Ensure that the operating room is prepared, and all necessary equipment (e.g., laparotomy tray, suction) is readily available. Anticipate the need for post-operative management, including wound care and monitoring for complications.",

The pathophysiology involves the increased hydrostatic pressure within the abdominal cavity, which compresses abdominal vasculature and impairs organ perfusion. This action reflects a failure to recognize the change in the client's condition from hypovolemic shock to obstructive shock due to ACS.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Blindly following fluid resuscitation protocols without considering the patient's response can be detrimental.

Reverse Trendelenburg may be considered as an adjunct therapy after addressing the more critical issues.",
