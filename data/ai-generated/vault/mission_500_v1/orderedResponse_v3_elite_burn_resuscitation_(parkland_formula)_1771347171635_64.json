The client's data (tense abdomen, rising peak inspiratory pressures, falling MAP and urine output despite high fluid rates, rising lactate) strongly indicates developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) progressing to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS creates an obstructive shock state by compressing the vena cava and abdominal organs. Continuing to blindly infuse massive fluid volumes will worsen the IAH, exacerbate organ failure, and precipitate cardiovascular collapse. The nurse must recognize that the 'more fluids' algorithm for burn shock is now actively harmful and must be paused to allow for immediate reassessment and intervention."

The respiratory therapist must be notified due to the critically high peak inspiratory pressures (45 cm H2O), which indicate severe pulmonary compromise from the diaphragm being pushed upwards, increasing the risk of barotrauma and hypoxemia. This is a collaborative emergency."

However, the intra-abdominal signs point toward the need for a decompressive laparotomy, the only definitive treatment for ACS.
