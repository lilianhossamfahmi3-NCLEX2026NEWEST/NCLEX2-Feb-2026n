    "feedback": "The nurse must recognize the constellation of findings that make proceeding with prone positioning unsafe at this time. These include hemodynamic instability (hypotension despite vasopressors, lactic acidosis), severe thrombocytopenia (high risk of bleeding), and signs of intra-abdominal hypertension. The nurse's independent action is to withhold the intervention and immediately communicate these critical contraindications to the provider to re-evaluate the plan of care and stabilize the patient first.",

        "id": "opt_1",
        "text": "Neuromuscular blockade initiated with cisatracurium 2 hours ago",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Cisatracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) used to induce paralysis, often necessary in ARDS to optimize ventilation and reduce oxygen consumption. NMBAs prevent patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, allowing for better control of respiratory parameters and improved gas exchange. Paralysis facilitates lung-protective ventilation strategies. It is a prerequisite for, not a contraindication to, prone positioning. Clinical Pearl: Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia are administered concurrently with NMBAs to prevent awareness and discomfort.",

        "text": "Abdomen is distended and firm.",
        "rationale": "Correct. Abdominal distension and firmness are cardinal signs of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). In ARDS, IAH can be exacerbated by mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and decreased abdominal wall compliance. Prone positioning can further increase intra-abdominal pressure, compromising venous return, cardiac output, and renal perfusion. Increased IAP can also impede diaphragmatic excursion, worsening ventilation. Clinical Pearl: Monitor abdominal pressure via bladder pressure monitoring in high-risk patients. Report IAP >12 mmHg.",

        "id": "opt_3",
        "text": "85/50 (62) on norepinephrine 10 mcg/min",
        "rationale": "Correct. A MAP of 62 mmHg despite a high dose of norepinephrine (10 mcg/min) indicates profound hemodynamic instability and refractory hypotension. In ARDS, hypotension can result from sepsis, hypovolemia, or impaired cardiac function. Prone positioning can cause transient but significant hemodynamic shifts due to altered venous return and increased intrathoracic pressure. Initiating prone positioning in an unstable patient increases the risk of cardiac arrest. Clinical Pearl: Optimize fluid status and vasopressor support before considering prone positioning.",

        "id": "opt_4",
        "text": "PaO2 54 mmHg",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Severe hypoxemia (PaO2 54 mmHg on FiO2 1.0) is the *primary indication* for prone positioning in ARDS. Prone positioning improves oxygenation by redistributing lung perfusion, reducing atelectasis, and improving ventilation-perfusion matching. While this value is critically low and life-threatening, it is the reason to consider the therapy, not a reason to withhold it, assuming the patient is stable enough for the procedure. Clinical Pearl: Prone positioning is typically considered when PaO2/FiO2 ratio remains <150 mmHg despite optimal ventilator settings.",

        "text": "Lactate: 4.8 mmol/L",
        "rationale": "Correct. An elevated lactate level (4.8 mmol/L) indicates anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoperfusion, suggesting shock. In ARDS, shock can be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac dysfunction. Elevated lactate reflects inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Prone positioning can exacerbate hypoperfusion if hemodynamic instability is not addressed. Clinical Pearl: Serial lactate measurements are crucial to assess response to resuscitation efforts.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 45,000/mm³) increases the risk of bleeding complications. In ARDS, thrombocytopenia can be caused by sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Prone positioning involves significant patient manipulation, increasing the risk of bleeding from invasive lines or pressure points. Clinical Pearl: Transfuse platelets to maintain a platelet count >50,000/mm³ before initiating prone positioning.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Elevated BUN and creatinine indicate acute kidney injury (AKI), a common complication of ARDS and sepsis. AKI results from renal hypoperfusion and inflammation. While AKI requires careful management, it does not directly contraindicate prone positioning if the patient is otherwise stable. It is part of the overall multi-organ dysfunction syndrome picture but is not a primary factor in the immediate procedural safety decision. Clinical Pearl: Monitor urine output and renal function closely in ARDS patients.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. This is the provider's order. While the nurse must question this order, the clinical judgment task is to identify the *clinical data* that makes the order unsafe to follow. Highlighting the order itself does not demonstrate an analysis of the patient's physiological status. The nurse must use clinical reasoning to determine if the order is appropriate based on the patient's current condition.",
