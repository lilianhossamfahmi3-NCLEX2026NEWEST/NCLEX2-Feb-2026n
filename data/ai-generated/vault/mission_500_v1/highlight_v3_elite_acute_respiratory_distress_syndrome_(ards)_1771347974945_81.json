        "feedback": "The nurse must recognize the constellation of findings that make proceeding with prone positioning unsafe at this time. These include hemodynamic instability (hypotension despite vasopressors, lactic acidosis), severe thrombocytopenia (high risk of bleeding), and signs of intra-abdominal hypertension. The nurse's independent action is to withhold the intervention and immediately communicate these critical contraindications to the provider to re-evaluate the plan of care and stabilize the patient first.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. The use of a neuromuscular blocking agent (paralytic) is an expected and often necessary intervention to facilitate effective mechanical ventilation, prevent ventilator dyssynchrony, and reduce oxygen consumption in severe ARDS. It is a prerequisite for, not a contraindication to, prone positioning."

                "rationale": "Correct. This physical assessment finding is highly suggestive of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). IAH is a relative contraindication to prone positioning as turning the patient prone can further increase intra-abdominal pressure, which can compromise cardiac output, renal perfusion, and ventilation, negating the potential benefits of the maneuver."

                "rationale": "Correct. This finding indicates significant hemodynamic instability. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is below the goal of 65 mmHg, even with an increasing vasopressor requirement. Prone positioning can cause transient but significant hemodynamic shifts. Initiating the maneuver in an unstable patient places them at high risk for profound hypotension or cardiac arrest."

                "text": "PaO2 54 mmHg",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Severe, refractory hypoxemia (a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 54) is the primary *indication* for initiating prone positioning in ARDS. While this value is critically low and life-threatening, it is the reason to consider the therapy, not a reason to withhold it, assuming the patient is stable enough for the procedure."

                "rationale": "Correct. An elevated lactate level is a key indicator of systemic hypoperfusion and metabolic acidosis (shock). This finding corroborates the vital signs data, confirming that the patient is in a state of shock. This level of instability is a critical reason to pause and notify the provider before proceeding with a high-risk maneuver like proning."

                "rationale": "Correct. This represents severe thrombocytopenia (a sharp drop from the previous day), which is a significant relative contraindication for prone positioning. The physical act of turning the patient involves multiple staff members and significant manipulation, which increases the risk of dislodging central lines, arterial lines, or endotracheal tubes, potentially leading to life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient with a severely impaired ability to clot."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. These values indicate acute kidney injury (AKI), which is a common and serious complication of shock and ARDS. However, AKI itself does not directly contraindicate the prone positioning maneuver. It is part of the overall multi-organ dysfunction syndrome picture but is not a primary factor in the immediate procedural safety decision."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. This is the provider's order. While the nurse must question this order, the clinical judgment task is to identify the *clinical data* that makes the order unsafe to follow. Highlighting the order itself does not demonstrate an analysis of the patient's physiological status."
