Hypokalemia significantly increases the risk of digoxin toxicity by enhancing its binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in myocardial cells, leading to dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

A drop to 52 bpm, especially with a new irregular rhythm, is a hallmark sign of digoxin toxicity (brady-dysrhythmia) and is a contraindication for administration. Bradycardia reduces cardiac output, potentially leading to hypotension and decreased tissue perfusion.",

The rise in creatinine from 1.7 to 2.1 mg/dL indicates worsening renal function (acute kidney injury), which will decrease the clearance of digoxin, leading to its accumulation and increasing the risk of toxicity.
