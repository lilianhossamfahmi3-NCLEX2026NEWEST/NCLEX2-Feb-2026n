The nurse's highest priority is to recognize and act on immediate threats to safety. The combination of critically low fibrinogen, low platelets, and markedly elevated D-dimer confirms a consumptive coagulopathy (DIC). Placing an epidural or spinal catheter in a client with DIC is an absolute contraindication due to the high risk of a spinal-epidural hematoma, which can cause permanent paralysis. Therefore, the nurse must immediately communicate this critical safety concern to the team to STOP the planned procedure (Action A). Concurrently, recognizing the client is in hemorrhagic shock, the nurse must act to facilitate massive transfusion and resuscitation. The order for two large-bore IVs is appropriate, and if only one is present, placing the second is a critical, independent nursing action to prepare for rapid administration of fluids and blood products (Action E).",

Administering a fluid bolus (B) is necessary but does not address the primary safety issue of the contraindicated procedure. Preparing for a C-section (C) is the definitive treatment, but the nurse's priority is to ensure the *mode of anesthesia* is safe; this requires communication first. Administering morphine (D) is inappropriate as it can mask worsening symptoms and cause maternal/fetal respiratory depression in this unstable client.
