    "correct": "The synthesis of the client's clinical data indicates a severe placental abruption leading to hemorrhagic shock and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). The nurse's highest priority is to recognize and act on immediate threats to safety. The combination of critically low fibrinogen, low platelets, and markedly elevated D-dimer confirms a consumptive coagulopathy (DIC). In DIC, the body's clotting factors are consumed faster than they can be produced, leading to both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Placing an epidural or spinal catheter in a client with DIC is an absolute contraindication due to the high risk of a spinal-epidural hematoma, which can cause permanent paralysis. The impaired clotting ability increases the risk of bleeding into the spinal space, compressing the spinal cord. Therefore, the nurse must immediately communicate this critical safety concern to the team to STOP the planned procedure (Action A). Concurrently, recognizing the client is in hemorrhagic shock due to blood loss from the placental abruption, the nurse must act to facilitate massive transfusion and resuscitation. The order for two large-bore IVs is appropriate, and if only one is present, placing the second is a critical, independent nursing action to prepare for rapid administration of fluids and blood products (Action E). Large-bore IVs (16-18 gauge) are essential for rapid infusion to restore circulating volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.",
    "incorrect": "While several other actions are relevant to the client's care, they are not the immediate priority, or they are unsafe. Administering a fluid bolus (B) is necessary but does not address the primary safety issue of the contraindicated procedure. Preparing for a C-section (C) is the definitive treatment, but the nurse's priority is to ensure the *mode of anesthesia* is safe; this requires communication first. Administering morphine (D) is inappropriate as it can mask worsening symptoms and cause maternal/fetal respiratory depression in this unstable client. Opioids can further compromise blood pressure and oxygenation. Simply documenting and monitoring (F) is passive and fails to address the life-threatening emergency and iatrogenic risk. The client's condition is rapidly deteriorating, and immediate intervention is required.",

        "justification": "This is a critical 'STOP' action. The laboratory results (fibrinogen <150 mg/dL, platelets 115,000/mm³, high D-dimer) are pathognomonic for DIC. Performing neuraxial anesthesia in this state carries a high risk of spinal hematoma and paralysis. The nurse's primary responsibility is to identify this contraindication and prevent harm. The rapid consumption of clotting factors in DIC increases the risk of bleeding into the epidural space, leading to spinal cord compression and permanent neurological damage."
