On arrival, the client reports a 'pounding, 10/10 headache' that started suddenly about an hour ago. Client is visibly flushed with profuse diaphoresis noted on the forehead, face, and neck. Skin below the level of the T4 injury is pale, cool, and has notable piloerection ('goosebumps'). The client also reports blurred vision and significant nasal congestion. He denies chest pain but states, 'I feel like my heart is going to explode out of my chest.'"

The constellation of severe hypertension, pounding headache, diaphoresis above the injury level, and paradoxical bradycardia is pathognomonic. The immediate nursing priorities are to lower the blood pressure and eliminate the underlying noxious stimulus. The correct actions directly address these priorities: placing the client upright uses gravity to help lower BP, checking the catheter and loosening clothing are primary assessments to find and remove the stimulus, and administering a rapid-acting vasodilator (Hydralazine) is the appropriate pharmacological intervention for severe hypertension in AD.",

Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is contraindicated as it will worsen the severe, unopposed parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation causing the bradycardia, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. This is a classic 'Don't Proceed' / 'Safety Stop' scenario. Preparing for a Head CT is not the immediate priority; it delays life-saving interventions aimed at resolving the cause of the hypertensive crisis.
