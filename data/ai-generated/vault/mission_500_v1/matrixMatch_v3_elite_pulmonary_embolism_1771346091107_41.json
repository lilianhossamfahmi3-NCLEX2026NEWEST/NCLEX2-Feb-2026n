Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, works by activating plasminogen, leading to the breakdown of fibrin clots. In a patient with thrombocytopenia, the risk of bleeding is significantly increased because the body's natural clotting mechanisms are already compromised. The nurse must withhold the medication and immediately notify the prescribing provider of this critical laboratory value. This is a primary safety stop.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mmHg) is a defining feature of a massive PE and is an *indication* for thrombolytic therapy, not a contraindication. However, it also signifies obstructive shock and severe hemodynamic instability. The nurse may need to take action by ensuring large-bore IV access is available, preparing for potential vasopressor administration (e.g., norepinephrine) to support blood pressure, and increasing the frequency of monitoring (e.g., vital signs every 5-15 minutes). Hypotension in PE results from right ventricular failure and decreased cardiac output. While thrombolytics address the underlying cause, immediate support is crucial. This finding does not warrant withholding the life-saving medication.",

Major surgery within the preceding 3 weeks, particularly a major abdominal surgery, is a strong contraindication to thrombolytic therapy due to the high risk of severe bleeding from the surgical site. The surgical site is vulnerable to disruption of newly formed clots, and the systemic thrombolysis induced by alteplase can lead to uncontrolled hemorrhage. This finding represents an unacceptable risk for hemorrhage. The nurse must withhold the alteplase and immediately clarify the order with the provider, highlighting this critical piece of the client's history. This is a primary safety stop.",

The right ventricle struggles to pump against the increased pulmonary vascular resistance caused by the emboli, leading to ischemia and release of troponin. This finding supports the severity of the diagnosis and the need for urgent intervention; it does not require any specific nursing action prior to administering the alteplase.",

The emboli obstruct pulmonary blood flow, preventing oxygen exchange in the affected lung regions. This finding is the reason for the emergency treatment, not a reason to withhold it. The appropriate action (administering high-flow oxygen) has already been taken. This finding reinforces the urgency of administering the alteplase.",
