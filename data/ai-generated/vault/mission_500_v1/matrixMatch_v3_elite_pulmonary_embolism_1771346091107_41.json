The provider has ordered a STAT infusion of alteplase. The nurse reviews the client's most current electronic health record data before initiating the infusion. For each finding, specify if the nurse must take action, may need to take action, or if no action is needed before administering the alteplase.",

The nurse may need to take action by ensuring large-bore IV access is available, preparing for potential vasopressor administration, and increasing the frequency of monitoring, but this finding does not warrant withholding the life-saving medication."
