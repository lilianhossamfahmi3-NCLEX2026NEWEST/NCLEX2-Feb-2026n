Parents report the child was seen at an urgent care center yesterday, diagnosed with 'a virus,' and sent home. They could not get an earlier appointment with their primary care provider due to scheduling conflicts. Child is sitting upright on the gurney, leaning forward in a tripod position, with significant drooling and chin thrust forward. Voice is muffled and thick. Appears anxious and is making audible inspiratory sounds (stridor). He is becoming increasingly restless and irritable over the last 30 minutes, now appearing lethargic."

The combination of inspiratory stridor, tripod positioning, x-ray findings of critical narrowing, and deteriorating vital signs (especially the decreasing respiratory rate from 45 to 28, indicating respiratory fatigue) signifies impending airway failure.
