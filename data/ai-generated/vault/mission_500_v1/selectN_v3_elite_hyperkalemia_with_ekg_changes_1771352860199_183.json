Calcium gluconate is the priority to stabilize the cardiac membrane by raising the threshold potential, protecting against arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. It doesn't lower potassium but buys time for other treatments. **Clinical Pearl:** Administer slowly to avoid hypotension. Monitor ECG during administration.",
          "pathophysiology": "Hyperkalemia reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential, counteracting this effect and stabilizing the myocardium."

Administering it with a K+ of 7.8 mEq/L could be fatal. This is a critical safety stop. **Clinical Pearl:** Always review medications for potassium-elevating effects in hyperkalemic patients.",
          "pathophysiology": "ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone normally stimulates sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubules of the kidneys. Its inhibition leads to potassium retention."

Continuous monitoring allows immediate detection of deterioration (e.g., sine wave, VT, asystole) for prompt intervention. **Clinical Pearl:** Have emergency equipment (defibrillator, pacing) readily available.",

However, the client has acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr) and oliguria (15 mL/2 hours) likely from rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK). Furosemide will be ineffective and is not the priority for life-threatening cardiotoxicity. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess renal function before administering diuretics, especially in crush injuries.",
          "pathophysiology": "Rhabdomyolysis releases intracellular contents, including myoglobin, into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can precipitate in the renal tubules, causing acute tubular necrosis and kidney injury. Impaired kidney function reduces the effectiveness of diuretics."

IV regular insulin (which stimulates the Na-K-ATPase pump) followed by dextrose (to prevent hypoglycemia) rapidly lowers serum potassium. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood glucose closely after insulin administration to prevent hypoglycemia.",
          "pathophysiology": "Insulin stimulates the Na-K-ATPase pump in cell membranes, promoting the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular fluid. Dextrose is administered to prevent hypoglycemia, which can occur due to the effects of insulin."

IV medications are the priority. **Clinical Pearl:** Consider bowel function before administering; contraindicated in bowel obstruction.",
          "pathophysiology": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the large intestine, promoting potassium excretion in the feces. This process is relatively slow compared to other methods of potassium reduction."

The client will likely be NPO for procedures like dialysis. **Clinical Pearl:** Educate patients on potassium-rich foods for long-term management after the acute phase.",
          "pathophysiology": "Dietary potassium restriction is a long-term strategy to manage hyperkalemia by reducing potassium intake. However, it does not provide immediate relief in acute situations."
