Calcium gluconate is the first-line, priority intervention to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. It does not lower the serum potassium level but protects the heart while other treatments take effect."

Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, a class of drugs known to cause hyperkalemia by decreasing aldosterone secretion. Administering this medication to a client with a potassium of 7.8 mEq/L would be life-threatening, as it would worsen the hyperkalemia and increase the risk of cardiac arrest."

Given the severe hyperkalemia and active ECG changes (bradycardia, widened QRS), the client is at extremely high risk for sudden, lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection of any deterioration, such as progression to a sine wave pattern, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole, allowing for prompt intervention."

However, this client is experiencing an acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr) secondary to rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK), as evidenced by oliguria (15 mL output in 2 hours). The medication will be ineffective in a non-functioning kidney and is not the priority intervention for life-threatening cardiotoxicity."

A combination of IV regular insulin (which activates the Na-K-ATPase pump) followed by dextrose (to prevent hypoglycemia) is a rapid and effective method to temporarily lower the serum potassium level."

While it is a valid treatment for hyperkalemia, its onset of action is very slow (several hours) and it is not appropriate for treating an acute, life-threatening cardiac emergency. The priority is IV medications that act within minutes."

While a potassium-restricted diet is a standard part of managing chronic or resolving hyperkalemia, it is not an immediate priority action for a client with critical cardiotoxicity. The client's life is at immediate risk, requiring pharmacological intervention, not dietary changes. The client is also likely to be made NPO in anticipation of further procedures like dialysis."
