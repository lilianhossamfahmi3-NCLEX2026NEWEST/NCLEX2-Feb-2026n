        "correct": "The client's presentation of cardiac arrest is a direct result of life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 8.5 mEq/L), a common complication for clients with ESRD who miss dialysis treatments. This severe electrolyte imbalance destabilizes the cardiac membrane potential, leading to bradycardia, conduction blocks, and ultimately ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). The immediate, life-saving actions for V-Fib are to restore perfusion via high-quality chest compressions and to terminate the chaotic electrical activity with defibrillation, per ACLS guidelines. Monitoring ETCO2 provides real-time feedback on the effectiveness of chest compressions and is an early indicator of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC). Monitoring serum potassium is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at correcting the underlying cause of the arrest (e.g., IV calcium, insulin/dextrose, bicarbonate).",
        "incorrect": "Selecting the wrong condition, actions, or monitoring parameters could result in delayed or harmful interventions. Administering potassium chloride is a lethal action that would worsen the hyperkalemia and ensure resuscitation failure. Transcutaneous pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardias, not V-Fib. Monitoring urine output or pupillary response are secondary assessments and not the most immediate indicators of resuscitation effectiveness during a code.",
