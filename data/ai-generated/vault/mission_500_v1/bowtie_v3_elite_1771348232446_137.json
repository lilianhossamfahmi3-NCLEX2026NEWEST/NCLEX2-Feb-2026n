    "correct": "**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 58-year-old male, ESRD, unresponsive, apneic, pulseless in V-Fib.\n*   **Background:** Missed dialysis x2, weakness, palpitations, K+ 8.5 mEq/L.\n*   **Assessment:** Cardiac arrest likely due to severe hyperkalemia-induced V-Fib.\n*   **Recommendation:** Continue CPR, defibrillate, monitor ETCO2 and K+ levels.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Severe hyperkalemia (K+ > 6.0 mEq/L) disrupts the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells. Normally, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a higher concentration of potassium inside the cell and sodium outside. Hyperkalemia reduces the gradient, making cells more excitable initially, but eventually leading to depolarization block. This manifests as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately, ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) or asystole. In ESRD, the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium, coupled with missed dialysis, leads to rapid and dangerous potassium accumulation.\n\n**Actions:**\n*   **Initiate high-quality chest compressions:** Essential to provide artificial circulation, delivering oxygen to vital organs until the heart can be restarted. Compressions should be at least 2 inches deep and at a rate of 100-120 per minute.\n*   **Defibrillate with 200 joules (biphasic):** V-Fib is a chaotic electrical rhythm requiring immediate defibrillation to depolarize the myocardium simultaneously, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker to regain control.\n\n**Parameters:**\n*   **End-tidal CO2 (ETCO2):** Reflects the CO2 level exhaled with each breath. During CPR, it indicates the effectiveness of chest compressions (aim for >10 mmHg). A sudden increase suggests Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC).\n*   **Serum potassium level:** Crucial to monitor the effectiveness of hyperkalemia treatment (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, dialysis). Serial measurements guide further interventions.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, consider administering calcium gluconate IV push *before* defibrillation to stabilize the cardiac membrane and increase the likelihood of successful defibrillation. Also, anticipate the need for emergent dialysis if medical management fails to correct the hyperkalemia.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting the wrong condition, actions, or monitoring parameters could result in delayed or harmful interventions. Administering potassium chloride is a lethal action that would worsen the hyperkalemia and ensure resuscitation failure. Transcutaneous pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardias, not V-Fib. Monitoring urine output or pupillary response are secondary assessments and not the most immediate indicators of resuscitation effectiveness during a code.",
