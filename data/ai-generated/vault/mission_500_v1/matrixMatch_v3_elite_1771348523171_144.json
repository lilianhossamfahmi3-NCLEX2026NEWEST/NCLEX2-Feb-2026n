The client is awake, alert, and oriented x4 but is in significant distress and reports severe pain and chest tightness. Full- and partial-thickness burns are noted to the entire anterior torso and the full circumference of the right arm. Soot is present around the nares and in sputum. The client states, 'My chest feels like an elephant is sitting on it.' He reports a history of hypertension and 'recreational' cocaine use but has not seen a doctor in over 10 years."

    "correct": "The client's presentation indicates a critical situation requiring immediate intervention. While burn management is important, the ECG and troponin levels reveal an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The client's chest pain, ST-segment elevation, and elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial damage. The progressive hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia despite fluid administration suggest cardiogenic shock, where the heart cannot effectively pump blood. Continuing fluid resuscitation as per the Parkland formula, designed for hypovolemic shock from burns, is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock. The failing heart cannot handle the increased fluid volume, leading to pulmonary edema and further cardiovascular compromise. The priority is to immediately notify the provider of the STEMI to initiate appropriate cardiac interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or thrombolytic therapy, to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. This addresses the primary life-threatening condition.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to recognize the STEMI and continuing with standard burn care protocols will worsen the client's condition and increase the risk of mortality. Prioritizing or indicating fluid resuscitation will exacerbate the cardiogenic shock, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Delaying notification to the provider to perform other tasks, such as wound care or catheter insertion, wastes critical time in the 'time is muscle' window for myocardial reperfusion. These actions, while potentially indicated later, are secondary to addressing the acute myocardial infarction.",

        "classification": "Contraindicated",
        "justification": "Continuing fluid resuscitation at this rate is contraindicated due to the client's STEMI and developing cardiogenic shock. The failing heart cannot handle the increased fluid volume, leading to pulmonary edema, worsening hypoxia, and hemodynamic collapse. This action will increase preload on an already failing ventricle, exacerbating the cardiogenic shock."

        "label": "Immediately notify the provider of the ECG and troponin results.",
        "classification": "Priority Action",
        "justification": "This is the priority action. The provider must be immediately alerted to the STEMI diagnosis based on the ECG and troponin results. This will facilitate the activation of the cardiac catheterization lab or the initiation of thrombolytic therapy to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. Addressing the acute myocardial infarction is paramount to stabilizing the client's condition."

        "label": "Administer prescribed morphine for chest pain and burn pain.",
        "classification": "Indicated, Not Priority",
        "justification": "Morphine is indicated for pain management in both burn injuries and STEMI. It can reduce pain, anxiety, and myocardial oxygen demand. However, it can also cause hypotension, which is a concern given the client's current hemodynamic instability. While morphine should be administered, it is not the priority over addressing the life-threatening STEMI. This action can be prepared while another team member contacts the provider."

      {
        "label": "Prepare for escharotomy of the right arm.",
        "classification": "Indicated, Not Priority",
        "justification": "Escharotomy may be necessary to relieve pressure and restore circulation in the right arm due to the circumferential full-thickness burn. However, this is not the immediate priority. The client must be hemodynamically stabilized before or during any surgical procedures. Addressing the STEMI and cardiogenic shock takes precedence over this intervention."

      {
        "label": "Request a prescription for an indwelling urinary catheter.",
        "classification": "Indicated, Not Priority",
        "justification": "An indwelling urinary catheter is indicated for accurate monitoring of urine output, which is crucial for assessing fluid resuscitation adequacy and renal perfusion. However, this is not the immediate life-saving action. The priority is to address the cardiogenic shock that is causing the renal hypoperfusion in the first place. Inserting the catheter can be done after the client is stabilized."

    "clinicalPearls": "*   **STEMI Mimics:** Be vigilant for atypical presentations of STEMI, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities or confounding factors like burn injuries. Always consider cardiac involvement in patients presenting with chest pain, even if other conditions seem more obvious.\n*   **Cardiogenic Shock vs. Hypovolemic Shock:** Differentiate between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. Fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of hypovolemic shock treatment but is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock. Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema, during fluid resuscitation.\n*   **Time is Muscle:** In STEMI, rapid intervention is crucial to minimize myocardial damage. Prompt notification of the provider and activation of the cardiac catheterization lab or initiation of thrombolytic therapy are essential.\n*   **SBAR Communication:** Use SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) for clear and concise communication with the provider. Clearly articulate the client's critical findings and your recommendations for immediate intervention.\n*   **Burn Resuscitation Caveats:** While the Parkland formula is a standard guideline for burn resuscitation, it should be adjusted based on the client's individual response and underlying conditions. Be prepared to modify the resuscitation plan based on the client's evolving clinical status."
