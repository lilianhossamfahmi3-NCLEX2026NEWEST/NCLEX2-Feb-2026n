The client is awake, alert, and oriented x4 but is in significant distress and reports severe pain and chest tightness. Full- and partial-thickness burns are noted to the entire anterior torso and the full circumference of the right arm. Soot is present around the nares and in sputum. The client states, 'My chest feels like an elephant is sitting on it.' He reports a history of hypertension and 'recreational' cocaine use but has not seen a doctor in over 10 years."

        "correct": "The synthesis of clinical data reveals a life-threatening condition that supersedes the standard burn resuscitation protocol. The client's chest pain, ST-segment elevation on ECG, and markedly elevated troponin are definitive signs of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The progressive hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening hypoxia, despite fluid administration, are signs of developing cardiogenic shock, not just hypovolemic shock from the burn. The Parkland formula is designed to treat hypovolemia. Administering large fluid volumes to a client with a failing cardiac pump (cardiogenic shock) will precipitate acute pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, the absolute priority is to recognize this contraindication, STOP the aggressive fluid infusion, and immediately notify the provider of the critical cardiac findings to initiate STEMI protocol.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to identify the STEMI and continuing with standard burn care places the client at risk for imminent death. Classifying fluid resuscitation as a priority or indicated is a fatal error, as it directly worsens the underlying cardiogenic shock. Delaying notification to the provider to perform other 'indicated' tasks like wound care or catheter insertion wastes critical time in the 'time is muscle' window for myocardial reperfusion.",
