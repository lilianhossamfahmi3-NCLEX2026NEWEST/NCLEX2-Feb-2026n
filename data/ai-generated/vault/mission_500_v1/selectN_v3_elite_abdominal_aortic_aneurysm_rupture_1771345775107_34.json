Skin is noted to be pale, cool, and diaphoretic. Spouse reports client has a history of hypertension and a 5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that is monitored by a vascular specialist three hours away.

The initial BP of 155/90 was a temporary compensatory response. The vital sign trend clearly shows a falling blood pressure (110/70) and rising heart rate (138). Administering an antihypertensive like labetalol would eliminate the client's compensatory vasoconstriction, leading to profound hypotension and cardiovascular collapse."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The nurse must recognize that the order for Labetalol, while seemingly appropriate based on the initial triage BP, is now contraindicated and dangerous. The client's clinical picture (falling BP, tachycardia, elevated lactate, low hemoglobin) indicates active hemorrhage and shock. The nurse has a duty to withhold the medication and immediately communicate these critical findings to the provider."

        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's SpO2 is decreasing (93%), and the respiratory rate is increasing (28), indicating respiratory distress and poor tissue perfusion. Maximizing oxygen delivery is a critical intervention in any shock state to support cellular function and prevent further decompensation."

        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position would cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, further decreasing venous return and exacerbating hypotension. The client should be kept supine, and if tolerated, the legs may be elevated to promote venous return to the core."

            "isCorrect": true,

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting clear signs of hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage. Administering an isotonic crystalloid bolus is an appropriate initial step to expand intravascular volume and support blood pressure while awaiting blood products."

        "opt_7": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is in severe pain, hemodynamic stabilization is the absolute priority. Morphine is a vasodilator and can cause respiratory depression, both of which would worsen the client's shock state. Pain management should be addressed, but only after critical life-saving interventions (IV access, fluids, oxygen, questioning the labetalol order) are initiated."
