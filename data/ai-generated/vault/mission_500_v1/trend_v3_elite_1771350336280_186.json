The client reports living alone and mentions difficulty arranging transportation for follow-up appointments, which is a source of stress. On admission, the client was anxious, pale, and diaphoretic. An IV heparin infusion was initiated per protocol upon arrival. The client is currently alert and oriented x4, reporting ongoing chest pain rated 6/10. No visible bleeding noted at this time.

    "correct": "The nurse must synthesize the trend data to identify a life-threatening contraindication to the ordered therapy. The client's platelet count has critically dropped from 195,000/mm³ to 45,000/mm³ in just three hours. This severe thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication for administering alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, due to an extremely high risk of fatal hemorrhage. This drop may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Administering a thrombolytic in this state could lead to catastrophic bleeding (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage). The only safe and correct priority action is to withhold the medication and immediately inform the provider of this critical change, as the entire treatment plan must be re-evaluated. \n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Alteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In the presence of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), the body's ability to form new clots to stop bleeding is severely compromised. Administering alteplase further impairs clot formation, leading to an unacceptably high risk of hemorrhage. If the thrombocytopenia is due to HIT, heparin causes an antibody-mediated reaction that activates platelets, leading to thrombosis and consumption of platelets, resulting in a low platelet count. Giving alteplase in this situation exacerbates the bleeding risk due to the already compromised clotting ability.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that either proceed with a dangerous intervention, misinterpret the priority, or cause an unsafe delay. Administering the alteplase would be a lethal error. Requesting platelets does not address the urgent need to halt the dangerous plan and may worsen thrombosis if HIT is the cause. Stopping heparin is part of the correct management, but simply redrawing labs without notifying the provider of the contraindication to the imminent alteplase dose is an unsafe delay in communication.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale for Incorrect Options:*\n*   Administering Alteplase: Directly contradicts the principle of 'do no harm.' It ignores the critical lab value indicating a high risk of bleeding.\n*   Requesting Platelets: If HIT is present, platelet transfusion can worsen the thrombotic process. The underlying cause of thrombocytopenia must be addressed first.\n*   Stopping Heparin and Redrawing Labs: While stopping heparin might be necessary if HIT is suspected, it delays the immediate need to prevent alteplase administration. The priority is to prevent harm from the thrombolytic.",

The risk of life-threatening bleeding far outweighs the benefit of clot lysis at this point. The nurse's priority is to prevent harm by stopping a dangerous intervention and communicating the critical data to the provider for a change in plan."

If the thrombocytopenia is due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), transfusing platelets can paradoxically increase the risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, this action incorrectly assumes the plan to give alteplase should continue and delays the urgent communication needed to stop the current plan and re-evaluate the client's coagulopathy."
