The client's platelet count has critically dropped from 195,000/mm³ to 45,000/mm³ in just three hours. This severe thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication for administering alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, due to an extremely high risk of fatal hemorrhage. This drop may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Administering a thrombolytic in this state could lead to catastrophic bleeding (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage). The only safe and correct priority action is to withhold the medication and immediately inform the provider of this critical change, as the entire treatment plan must be re-evaluated.",

Administering the alteplase would be a lethal error. Requesting platelets does not address the urgent need to halt the dangerous plan and may worsen thrombosis if HIT is the cause. Stopping heparin is part of the correct management, but simply redrawing labs without notifying the provider of the contraindication to the imminent alteplase dose is an unsafe delay in communication.",

The critical drop in platelets to 45,000/mm³ constitutes severe thrombocytopenia, which is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. The risk of life-threatening bleeding far outweighs the benefit of clot lysis at this point. The nurse's priority is to prevent harm by stopping a dangerous intervention and communicating the critical data to the provider for a change in plan."

While the PE is life-threatening, administering a thrombolytic to a client with a platelet count of 45,000/mm³ creates a new, more immediate life-threat: massive, uncontrollable hemorrhage. The nurse must recognize when a previously appropriate order becomes contraindicated by new data."

If the thrombocytopenia is due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), transfusing platelets can paradoxically increase the risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, this action incorrectly assumes the plan to give alteplase should continue and delays the urgent communication needed to stop the current plan and re-evaluate the client's coagulopathy."
