    "correct": "The client's persistently elevated blood pressure (BP >185/110 mmHg) is the primary concern. Alteplase (tPA) administration is contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension due to the increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion. The pathophysiology behind this contraindication lies in the fact that tPA, a thrombolytic agent, dissolves clots but also increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain. Pre-existing hypertension weakens blood vessel walls, making them more susceptible to rupture when exposed to tPA's fibrinolytic effects. The non-contrast head CT rules out hemorrhage, and the client is within the tPA window. However, the elevated BP poses an immediate threat. The nurse should withhold alteplase to prevent potential intracranial hemorrhage and administer labetalol IV per PRN order to lower the BP to a safe range (<185/110 mmHg). Post-labetalol, continuous BP monitoring is crucial to assess the drug's effectiveness. Neurological status monitoring using NIHSS helps detect any deterioration or improvement. Monitoring for bleeding is essential as both hypertension and thrombolysis increase bleeding risk.",
    "incorrect": "Administering alteplase with uncontrolled hypertension is a critical error. Trendelenburg position increases intracranial pressure, worsening the condition. While hyperglycemia should be addressed, it's not the immediate priority. Urine output and potassium levels are not directly related to the acute risk of hemorrhagic conversion.",
