The non-contrast head CT has ruled out an active hemorrhage, and the time since last known well (within the 3-4.5 hour window) makes the client a potential candidate for thrombolysis. However, administering tPA in the setting of severe, uncontrolled hypertension poses an extremely high risk of converting the ischemic stroke into a life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The correct nursing actions are to first 'stop the line' and withhold the alteplase (a critical safety action) and then to take action to correct the contraindication by administering the PRN IV labetalol to lower the blood pressure to the target of <185/110 mmHg. Following this intervention, the nurse must closely monitor the blood pressure to assess treatment efficacy, continue to monitor neurological status for any improvement or deterioration, and watch for signs of bleeding, which remains a risk even with blood pressure control.",

Placing the client in Trendelenburg position would dangerously increase intracranial pressure. Addressing the mildly elevated glucose is not the priority over the life-threatening risk of uncontrolled hypertension. Monitoring urine output and serum potassium are not the most critical parameters directly related to the immediate safety risk.",
