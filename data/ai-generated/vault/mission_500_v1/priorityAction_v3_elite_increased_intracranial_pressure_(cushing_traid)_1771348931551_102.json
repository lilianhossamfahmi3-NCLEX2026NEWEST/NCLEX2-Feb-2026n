The hypertension is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). While the blood pressure must be managed carefully, aggressively lowering it without addressing the underlying cause can decrease CPP and worsen brain ischemia. The most critical action is to prevent further harm by addressing the cause of the rising ICP, which is the active hemorrhage.",
