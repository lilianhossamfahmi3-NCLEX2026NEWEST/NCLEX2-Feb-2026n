The client is exhibiting signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including a severe headache, decreased level of consciousness, vomiting, sluggish pupil reaction, bradycardia, and irregular respirations (Cushing's triad). The hypertension is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Aggressively lowering the blood pressure without addressing the underlying cause of increased ICP can further compromise CPP and worsen brain ischemia. The priority is to prevent further harm by addressing the cause of the rising ICP, which is the active hemorrhage. Clinical Pearl: Recognize Cushing's Triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) as a late sign of increased ICP and impending herniation.",

However, it is not the highest priority in this situation. The nurse's immediate priority is to recognize and act on a life-threatening contraindication to prevent catastrophic iatrogenic harm.

The STAT Head CT shows significant mass effect and midline shift, indicating a high risk of brain herniation. Performing a lumbar puncture in a client with high ICP can cause a rapid decrease in pressure in the spinal column, leading to downward herniation of the brainstem through the foramen magnum, resulting in respiratory arrest and death. Clinical Pearl: Lumbar punctures are contraindicated in patients with suspected increased ICP due to the risk of precipitating brain herniation.",

Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) that inhibits clotting factors, preventing thrombus formation. Administering an anticoagulant like enoxaparin is absolutely contraindicated as it would worsen the active bleeding, increase the size of the hematoma, exacerbate the ICP crisis, and accelerate brain herniation. The nurse's most critical independent action is to recognize this life-threatening contraindication and withhold the medication to prevent causing irreversible harm. Clinical Pearl: Always review contraindications before administering medications, especially anticoagulants in patients with known or suspected bleeding.",

Applying oxygen is a necessary supportive measure to prevent secondary brain injury from hypoxia. However, it treats a symptom, not the cause. The highest priority is to prevent the underlying cause (the hemorrhage) from worsening due to a medication error. Withholding the enoxaparin is the primary action to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.
