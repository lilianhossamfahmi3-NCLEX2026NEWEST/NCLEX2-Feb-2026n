    "itemStem": "A nurse is preparing to administer 0900 medications to a 35-year-old client with a T4 spinal cord injury who is two days post-operative from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The client uses the call light and reports feeling unwell. The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record.",
    "prompt": "The nurse should identify which findings are the **most** concerning and require **immediate** intervention. **Highlight** the three most critical findings in the client's record.",
    "textToHighlight": "### Nurses' Note\n**0845:** Client reports a sudden, severe, pounding headache and states, \"I feel like my head is going to explode.\" Also reports blurry vision. Client is diaphoretic on the face and neck. Skin is flushed and red above the T4 level; pale and cool with goosebumps below. Client reports a new, deep, aching pain in the right upper abdomen, which they state is 'different from the surgery pain.' Bladder is not distended on palpation; client had 150 mL of clear yellow urine returned via straight catheterization 30 minutes ago.\n\n### Vital Signs\n| Time | BP (mmHg) | HR (bpm) | RR (/min) | SpO2 (%) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0400 | 110/68 | 56 | 16 | 99% RA |\n| 0800 | 142/90 | 52 | 18 | 98% RA |\n| 0845 | 198/112 | 48 | 22 | 98% RA |\n\n### Laboratory Results (0600)\n- **WBC:** 12,800/mm³ (5,000-10,000/mm³)\n- **Troponin I:** <0.03 ng/mL (<0.04 ng/mL)\n- **Creatinine:** 0.9 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL)\n\n### Medication Administration Record (MAR)\n- **Scheduled:** Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily at 0900\n- **PRN:** Hydralazine 10 mg IV push for SBP > 180 mmHg",

        "rationale": "This client is experiencing an autonomic dysreflexia (AD) crisis, a life-threatening emergency in individuals with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury. The nurse must immediately recognize the signs of a hypertensive crisis (headache, blurred vision, extremely high BP with reflex bradycardia) and simultaneously identify the probable cause to remove it. In this post-operative client, with the bladder ruled out as a cause, the new, specific abdominal pain is a critical clue pointing to a surgical complication (e.g., abscess, hematoma) as the noxious stimulus. The nurse's immediate actions should be to sit the client upright, investigate the source of pain, and prepare to administer the PRN IV antihypertensive, while notifying the provider. Proceeding with a routine oral medication like Lisinopril would be a serious error due to its slow onset and inadequacy for this emergency.",

            {
                "answer": "sudden, severe, pounding headache and states, \"I feel like my head is going to explode.\" Also reports blurry vision",
                "justification": "These are classic symptoms of a hypertensive crisis and indicate significant intracranial pressure and potential end-organ damage to the central nervous system. This signals a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) or seizure."
            },
            {
                "answer": "198/112",
                "justification": "This blood pressure reading represents malignant hypertension. It is the primary objective finding that quantifies the severity of the AD crisis and the immediate risk of life-threatening complications like stroke, myocardial infarction, or retinal hemorrhage. This finding, combined with the bradycardia, is pathognomonic for AD."
            },
            {
                "answer": "new, deep, aching pain in the right upper abdomen",
                "justification": "This is the most critical diagnostic clue. Since bladder distention (the most common cause of AD) has been ruled out, this new, localized pain in a post-operative client strongly suggests an intra-abdominal complication from the cholecystectomy is the noxious stimulus. Identifying and addressing the *cause* is the definitive treatment for AD, not just managing the blood pressure. Ignoring this clue would lead to a failure to resolve the crisis."

        "incorrect": [
            {
                "answer": "diaphoretic on the face and neck. Skin is flushed and red above the T4 level; pale and cool with goosebumps below",
                "justification": "While these are classic and expected signs of autonomic dysreflexia, they are manifestations of the underlying crisis. They confirm the diagnosis but are less critical than the hemodynamic numbers and CNS symptoms which quantify the immediate life-threat, or the clue that points to the cause."
            },
            {
                "answer": "client had 150 mL of clear yellow urine returned via straight catheterization 30 minutes ago",
                "justification": "This information is clinically important for ruling out bladder distention as the cause of the AD. However, it is a historical finding from an assessment already completed, not a current critical finding to act upon. It serves to redirect the nurse's assessment to other potential causes."
            },
            {
                "answer": "48",
                "justification": "The heart rate of 48 bpm represents reflex bradycardia, which is an expected component of the AD response to severe hypertension. While it confirms the diagnosis, the extreme hypertension (BP 198/112) is the more direct and immediate threat to the client's life that must be addressed."
            },
            {
                "answer": "WBC: 12,800/mm³",
                "justification": "The mild leukocytosis supports the suspicion of an underlying inflammatory or infectious process (like a post-operative abscess) which could be the cause of the AD. However, it is a laboratory value that provides context, not an acute, life-threatening finding in itself like the severe hypertension."
            },
            {
                "answer": "Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily at 0900",
                "justification": "This finding on the MAR is part of the clinical problem that requires a 'safety stop' action (i.e., withholding the medication). However, the instruction is to highlight the most concerning client *findings*. The medication order itself is not a finding of the client's condition, but rather a planned intervention that is now inappropriate for the acute crisis."
