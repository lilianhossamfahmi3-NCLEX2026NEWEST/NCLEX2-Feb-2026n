Temporary splint applied by paramedics. Client rates pain 8/10, describes as aching. Forearm is tense and edematous. Capillary refill in right hand is < 3 seconds, radial pulse palpable but faint compared to left. Neurovascular checks intact. Tetanus toxoid administered.\n\n<b>1700:</b> Client is increasingly agitated, reporting 'excruciating' pain (10/10) through translator, describing it as 'burning' and 'pressure.' Pain is unrelieved by morphine administered at 1600. Passive extension of the client's right fingers elicits a severe pain response. Digits are now cool to touch and pale. Client reports 'pins and needles' sensation in the hand. Urine in the bedside urinal is noted to be dark, tea-colored."

The client's laboratory results show a creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL and BUN of 35 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis (evidenced by the massively elevated CK and dark urine). Ketorolac is an NSAID, which is nephrotoxic and should not be administered to a client with renal impairment. Proceeding with this order would worsen the AKI."

            "rationale": "While elevation is used for typical edema, it is contraindicated in confirmed or suspected acute compartment syndrome. The pathophysiology involves increased pressure within the fascial compartment, which compromises arterial inflow. Elevating the limb above the heart level would further decrease arterial pressure and worsen perfusion, potentially leading to ischemic necrosis. The extremity should be kept at the level of the heart."

The client is exhibiting classic signs of acute compartment syndrome (pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch, paresthesia, pallor, coolness) and life-threatening complications (critical hyperkalemia of 6.8 mEq/L, AKI). This constitutes a limb- and life-threatening emergency requiring immediate medical and surgical intervention (e.g., fasciotomy, treatment for hyperkalemia)."

The nurse must immediately assess the cardiac impact of the hyperkalemia by obtaining an ECG to look for changes such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, or sine wave pattern, which precede cardiac arrest."

The nurse must act first by notifying the provider and obtaining the ECG. Documentation can be completed after immediate life-saving interventions have been initiated. Delaying action to document would be a critical error."
