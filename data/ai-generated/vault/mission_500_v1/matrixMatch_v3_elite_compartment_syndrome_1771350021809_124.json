Client rates pain 8/10, describes as aching. Forearm is tense and edematous. Capillary refill in right hand is < 3 seconds, radial pulse palpable but faint compared to left. Neurovascular checks intact. Tetanus toxoid administered.\n\n<b>1700:</b> Client is increasingly agitated, reporting 'excruciating' pain (10/10) through translator, describing it as 'burning' and 'pressure.' Pain is unrelieved by morphine administered at 1600. Passive extension of the client's right fingers elicits a severe pain response. Digits are now cool to touch and pale. Client reports 'pins and needles' sensation in the hand. Urine in the bedside urinal is noted to be dark, tea-colored."

      "choice": "Contraindicated",
      "rationale": "Ketorolac, an NSAID, is contraindicated due to the client's acute kidney injury (AKI), evidenced by elevated creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (35 mg/dL), likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis from the crush injury. NSAIDs are nephrotoxic, inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can exacerbate AKI and further compromise renal function. The dark, tea-colored urine also suggests myoglobinuria, further stressing the kidneys.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always assess renal function (BUN, creatinine, urine output) before administering NSAIDs. Avoid NSAIDs in patients with AKI or at risk for renal impairment. Consider alternative analgesics like opioids, while closely monitoring respiratory status and blood pressure.",

    "Elevate the affected extremity on two pillows above heart level.": {
      "choice": "Contraindicated",
      "rationale": "Elevation of the affected extremity is contraindicated in suspected acute compartment syndrome. While elevation can reduce edema in some cases, in compartment syndrome, it can decrease arterial perfusion to the already ischemic tissues within the confined space. This further reduces oxygen delivery, exacerbating tissue damage and potentially leading to irreversible muscle and nerve necrosis. The goal is to maintain the extremity at heart level to optimize arterial inflow.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In compartment syndrome, maintain the affected extremity at heart level to ensure adequate arterial perfusion. Avoid elevation above heart level. Closely monitor for worsening signs of ischemia.",

    "Notify the healthcare provider of the new assessment and laboratory findings.": {
      "choice": "Indicated",
      "rationale": "This is the highest priority action. The client exhibits classic signs of acute compartment syndrome (pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch, paresthesia, pallor, coolness) and life-threatening hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and AKI. Compartment syndrome requires immediate surgical intervention (fasciotomy) to relieve pressure and restore blood flow. Hyperkalemia can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Prompt notification allows for timely interventions to prevent limb loss and cardiac arrest. The dark urine suggests rhabdomyolysis, which can worsen AKI.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Early recognition and prompt notification of the provider are crucial in managing compartment syndrome and hyperkalemia. Time is tissue. Delay in treatment can lead to irreversible damage and death.",

    "Request a stat 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).": {
      "choice": "Indicated",
      "rationale": "A stat 12-lead ECG is crucial due to the critical hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L). Hyperkalemia alters cardiac cell membrane excitability, leading to characteristic ECG changes such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately, sine wave pattern and cardiac arrest. The ECG provides immediate information about the cardiac impact of hyperkalemia and guides treatment decisions, such as administering calcium gluconate to stabilize the myocardium.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. An ECG is essential to assess the cardiac impact and guide treatment. Be prepared to administer calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) as ordered.",

    "Apply ice packs to the splinted forearm.": {
      "choice": "Contraindicated",
      "rationale": "Applying ice packs is contraindicated in compartment syndrome. Ice causes vasoconstriction, further reducing blood flow to the already ischemic tissues within the compartment. This exacerbates tissue hypoxia and can worsen the condition. The priority is to improve perfusion, not restrict it. Cooling can also mask early signs of worsening ischemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid vasoconstrictive measures like ice in compartment syndrome, as they can worsen ischemia. Keep the extremity at heart level and maintain normothermia.",

    "Document the client's 1700 assessment findings in the EHR.": {
      "choice": "Non-essential",
      "rationale": "While documentation is important, it is not the immediate priority in this rapidly deteriorating, life-threatening situation. The nurse must first notify the provider, request the ECG, and prepare for interventions. Delaying action to document would be a critical error. Documentation can be completed after immediate life-saving interventions have been initiated and the patient is stabilized. Accurate and timely documentation is still essential, but it follows immediate patient care.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In emergency situations, prioritize immediate interventions over documentation. Delegate documentation if possible. Document thoroughly once the patient is stabilized.",

    "situation": "1700: A 42-year-old male in the ED with a right forearm crush injury sustained 4 hours ago is experiencing excruciating pain unrelieved by morphine. He exhibits signs of acute compartment syndrome and critical hyperkalemia.",
    "background": "The client arrived via EMS with a right forearm deformity, swelling, and ecchymosis. Initial pain was 8/10. He received tetanus toxoid at 1330. Labs at 1630 show K+ 6.8 mEq/L, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, BUN 35 mg/dL, and CK 62,500 U/L. Urine is dark, tea-colored. Morphine 4mg IV was given at 1600.",
    "assessment": "At 1700, the client is agitated, reporting 10/10 burning pain and pressure. Passive finger extension elicits severe pain. Digits are cool, pale, with paresthesia. BP 110/70, HR 122, RR 24, SpO2 97%. Suspect ECG changes related to hyperkalemia. Signs and symptoms are consistent with acute compartment syndrome.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately notify the healthcare provider of the assessment findings and lab results. Request a stat 12-lead ECG. Prepare for potential interventions such as fasciotomy and treatment for hyperkalemia. Hold the ketorolac order. Monitor urine output and continue frequent neurovascular assessments."
