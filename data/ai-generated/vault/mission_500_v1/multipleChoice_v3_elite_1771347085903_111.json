    "A"

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency in clients with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury (most commonly a distended bladder or bowel). This stimulus causes an unopposed sympathetic surge, leading to severe hypertension. The body's baroreceptors detect this hypertension and attempt to compensate by stimulating the vagus nerve, causing profound bradycardia. The nurse must recognize this is a hypertensive crisis with *compensatory* bradycardia. Administering a beta-blocker like metoprolol is extremely dangerous as it will worsen the bradycardia, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse and arrest. The correct priority action is to withhold this contraindicated medication and immediately proceed with AD protocol: sitting the client upright, loosening constrictive clothing, and assessing for and removing the noxious stimulus (e.g., checking for a kinked urinary catheter or performing a bladder scan).",
    "incorrect": "Options B, C, and D are incorrect and potentially lethal. Administering metoprolol (B) would exacerbate the severe bradycardia. Administering an opioid (C) does not address the underlying cause (hypertension) and can mask neurological changes. Lowering the head of the bed (D) is directly contraindicated as it would increase cerebral blood pressure, raising the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Correct. This is the critical 'SAFETY STOP' action. The client's severe hypertension (198/112) is coupled with profound bradycardia (HR 46). This is the hallmark of autonomic dysreflexia. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would further depress the heart rate, blocking the body's only compensatory mechanism and risking cardiac arrest. Withholding the medication is the priority safety action before initiating interventions to resolve the AD."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "justification": "Incorrect. This is the most dangerous option. While metoprolol is an antihypertensive, giving it in the context of the severe reflex bradycardia of AD is a lethal error. It would potentiate the vagal response, leading to life-threatening bradycardia and potential asystole. The hypertension must be managed by removing the stimulus first."

        "justification": "Incorrect. The pounding headache is a symptom of the extreme hypertension. Treating the symptom with an opioid is not the priority and fails to address the life-threatening root cause. It delays essential interventions and can mask worsening neurological status. The headache will resolve once the blood pressure is lowered by removing the noxious stimulus."

        "justification": "Incorrect. This action is directly contraindicated and harmful. The priority intervention for a client in AD is to immediately sit them upright (raise the head of the bed to 90 degrees) to induce orthostatic hypotension, which helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Lowering the head of the bed would increase cerebral perfusion pressure and exacerbate the risk of a stroke."
