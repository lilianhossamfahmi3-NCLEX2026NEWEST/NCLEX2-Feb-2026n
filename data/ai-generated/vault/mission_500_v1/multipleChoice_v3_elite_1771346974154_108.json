Reports missing the last two scheduled hemodialysis appointments due to a lack of reliable transportation. A 20-gauge peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter was placed in the left forearm by paramedics; it flushes sluggishly, and mild swelling is noted proximal to the site."

The priority pharmacological intervention is calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane. However, the nurse's assessment reveals the only existing peripheral IV is compromised (sluggish, swollen), indicating a high risk for infiltration or extravasation. Calcium gluconate is a potent vesicant that can cause severe tissue necrosis if it extravasates. Therefore, the absolute first and most critical safety action is to establish new, reliable, large-bore intravenous access to ensure the safe administration of this and other emergency medications. Proceeding with the current IV would be a breach of safety standards and constitutes a critical 'Don't Proceed' moment.",

While the pharmacological priorities are correct, they cannot be safely executed without addressing the compromised IV access first.
