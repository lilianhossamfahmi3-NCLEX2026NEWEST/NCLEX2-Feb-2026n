    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of severe hyperkalemia, a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, evidenced by the elevated potassium level (7.1 mEq/L) and the ECG findings (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, bradycardia). These ECG changes indicate hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity, which can rapidly progress to fatal arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The priority intervention is to stabilize the cardiac membrane with calcium gluconate to counteract the effects of hyperkalemia on myocardial cells. However, the nurse's assessment reveals that the existing peripheral IV (PIV) is compromised, indicated by sluggish flushing and swelling proximal to the insertion site. This suggests potential infiltration or extravasation, meaning the IV is not patent and medication may leak into surrounding tissues instead of reaching the bloodstream. Calcium gluconate is a vesicant, meaning it can cause severe tissue damage and necrosis if it extravasates. Therefore, the *absolute* first action is to establish a new, reliable, large-bore IV line to ensure safe and effective administration of calcium gluconate and other emergency medications. Delaying this step and attempting to administer medications through the compromised IV poses a significant risk of tissue injury and treatment failure.",
    "incorrect": "This question requires the nurse to prioritize interventions based on both physiological needs and safety considerations. While addressing the hyperkalemia is crucial, the compromised IV access presents an immediate safety risk that must be resolved first. The other options represent appropriate interventions for hyperkalemia but are not the *first* action due to the IV access issue.",

Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential of cardiac cells, making them less excitable and less prone to arrhythmias.

    "The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves the disruption of the normal resting membrane potential of cells, particularly cardiac cells. The elevated extracellular potassium concentration reduces the concentration gradient, leading to partial depolarization. This makes the cells more excitable initially (peaked T waves) but eventually leads to impaired repolarization and conduction delays (widened QRS, prolonged PR interval, bradycardia), increasing the risk of fatal arrhythmias."
