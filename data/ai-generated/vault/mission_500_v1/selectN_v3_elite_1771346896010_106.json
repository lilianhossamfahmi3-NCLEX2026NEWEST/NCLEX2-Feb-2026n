    "correct": "The patient is in ventricular fibrillation (V-fib), a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by chaotic, disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, leading to ineffective or absent cardiac output. Immediate defibrillation is crucial to convert the rhythm. However, safety is paramount. The presence of a transdermal patch (likely nitroglycerin for angina) poses a significant risk of electrical arcing and burns during defibrillation. Therefore, the nurse must first remove the patch to ensure safe and effective energy delivery. Simultaneously, standard defibrillation safety protocols must be followed, including confirming correct pad placement (anterolateral position is standard) to ensure current flow through the myocardium and announcing \"All clear\" to protect the code team from electrical shock. These actions prioritize patient safety and effective defibrillation.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options represent actions that are either improperly sequenced, ignore critical safety contraindications, or are not the immediate priority. Epinephrine is part of the ACLS algorithm but is administered after the initial shock if the rhythm persists. Delivering the shock without removing the patch is a major safety violation. Preparing calcium gluconate addresses hyperkalemia (a likely cause of the arrest) but is secondary to restoring circulation via defibrillation.",

        "justification": "Incorrect. While epinephrine is indicated in ACLS for persistent V-fib after defibrillation attempts, the immediate priority is to address the V-fib with defibrillation. Epinephrine is administered after the initial shock if the patient remains in a non-perfusing rhythm. Administering epinephrine before the first shock attempt is an incorrect sequence of actions and delays definitive treatment."

Transdermal patches, especially those containing metallic backings, can cause electrical arcing, skin burns, and ineffective energy delivery during defibrillation.

The patient's severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8) is a probable contributing factor to the cardiac arrest and requires treatment with calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane and reduce the risk of further arrhythmias. However, the absolute first priority in V-fib is defibrillation to restore a perfusing rhythm. Treating the underlying cause occurs concurrently or immediately after resuscitation attempts are underway. Hyperkalemia reduces the effectiveness of defibrillation, but defibrillation is still the priority."

The anterolateral position (right infraclavicular and left mid-axillary) is the standard placement to ensure the electrical current flows through the myocardium. This step is especially important after removing the transdermal patch to ensure the pads are placed on intact skin and in the optimal location for current delivery."
