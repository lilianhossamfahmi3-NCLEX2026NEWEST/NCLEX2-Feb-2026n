        "correct": "The patient is in Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib), a life-threatening arrhythmia requiring immediate defibrillation. However, a critical safety step must be performed first. The nurse's note indicates a transdermal patch on the chest. Given the history of angina, this is likely a nitroglycerin patch. Attempting to defibrillate over or near a medication patch can cause electrical arcing, leading to severe patient burns and creating a fire hazard. Therefore, the nurse must STOP and remove the patch before proceeding. Simultaneously, the nurse must ensure standard defibrillation safety protocols are followed, including correct pad placement (avoiding the area where the patch was) and announcing 'All clear' to protect the code team. These three actions represent the safest and most effective immediate response.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent actions that are either improperly sequenced, ignore a critical safety contraindication, or are not the immediate priority. Administering epinephrine is part of the ACLS algorithm, but it occurs after the first shock fails to convert the rhythm. Delivering the shock without removing the patch is a major safety violation. Preparing calcium gluconate is appropriate to address the severe hyperkalemia (a likely cause of the arrest), but restoring circulation via defibrillation is the absolute first priority.",

                "justification": "This is incorrect. According to ACLS guidelines for V-Fib, the immediate priority is high-quality CPR and defibrillation. Vasopressors like epinephrine are administered after the initial shock if the patient remains in a non-perfusing rhythm. Administering medication before the first shock attempt is an incorrect sequence of actions."

The presence of a transdermal patch (likely nitroglycerin) is a direct contraindication to placing a defibrillator pad over it. It can cause electrical arcing, severe skin burns, and ineffective energy delivery. The patch must be removed and the skin wiped clean before pads are applied and a shock is delivered."

The patient's severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8) is a probable cause of the cardiac arrest and requires urgent treatment with calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane. However, the absolute first priority in V-Fib is defibrillation to restore a perfusing rhythm.
