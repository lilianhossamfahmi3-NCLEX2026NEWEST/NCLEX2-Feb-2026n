The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record before calling transport. Based on the provided information, identify the condition the client is most likely experiencing, two actions the nurse should take, and two parameters the nurse should monitor.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. While urine output is a vital indicator of kidney function, it is not the most direct parameter to monitor for the immediate life-threatening complication of hyperkalemia. Specific gravity is even less relevant for assessing the acute cardiac risk."

                "rationale": "Correct. The ECG provides a real-time assessment of the physiological effect of potassium on the cardiac cells. Improvement in the QRS width and normalization of the T-waves are the most immediate indicators that treatments to lower serum potassium (e.g., calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose) are effectively stabilizing the myocardium."

                "rationale": "Correct. Since severe hyperkalemia is the life-threatening condition, monitoring the serum potassium level is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. The goal is to see a rapid decrease in the potassium level back toward a safe range."

BUN is a marker for uremia and kidney function but it changes relatively slowly and does not reflect the acute, minute-to-minute cardiac risk posed by hyperkalemia. Monitoring BUN is important for the overall management of AKI, but not for the immediate emergency."

The most immediate threat to life is cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia. Therefore, monitoring parameters directly related to potassium and its cardiac effects is the highest priority."
