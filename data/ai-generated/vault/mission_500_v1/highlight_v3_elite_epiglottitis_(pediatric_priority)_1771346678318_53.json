The child is sitting upright in a tripod position, leaning forward on her hands. She is anxious, mouth breathing, and has a muffled, 'hot potato' voice. Drooling is noted. Parents state she was 'perfectly fine' this morning. They report the family moved to the U.S. 8 months ago from a country with an inconsistent childhood immunization program and currently live in a multigenerational household."

        "Admit to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).": "This is an appropriate and necessary order. A child with acute epiglottitis is critically ill with a compromised airway and requires the high level of monitoring and intervention available only in a PICU setting.",
        "Administer Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV STAT.": "This is an appropriate and priority order. Acute epiglottitis is a bacterial infection (commonly *H. influenzae* type b). Prompt administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics is critical to treating the underlying cause.",
        "Obtain a throat culture for group A Streptococcus.": "This is the correct highlighted answer. This order is contraindicated and life-threatening. Any attempt to visualize the pharynx or use an instrument like a tongue depressor or culture swab can trigger a complete laryngospasm, leading to total airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. This procedure should never be performed outside of a controlled setting (like an operating room) where an emergency airway can be established immediately.",
        "Prepare for emergent intubation; notify anesthesiology and ENT.": "This is an appropriate and essential safety order. It demonstrates correct anticipation of the most severe complication of epiglottitis—airway loss. Mobilizing the expert teams for airway management is a key priority of care, not an error.",
        "Allow child to remain in a position of comfort with parents present.": "This is an appropriate and therapeutic order. Forcing the child to lie down can worsen airway obstruction. Allowing them to maintain their position of comfort (typically tripod) minimizes respiratory effort and anxiety. Keeping parents present also reduces stress, which can help prevent agitation and further respiratory compromise."
