The child is sitting upright in a tripod position, leaning forward on her hands. She is anxious, mouth breathing, and has a muffled, 'hot potato' voice. Drooling is noted. Parents state she was 'perfectly fine' this morning. They report the family moved to the U.S. 8 months ago from a country with an inconsistent childhood immunization program and currently live in a multigenerational household."

    "Admit to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is an appropriate and necessary order. A child with acute epiglottitis is critically ill with a compromised airway and requires the high level of monitoring and intervention available only in a PICU setting. The PICU provides the necessary resources for close observation, respiratory support, and potential airway management.",
      "pathophysiology": "Epiglottitis causes rapid inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues, leading to airway obstruction. The PICU is equipped to handle potential respiratory failure and provide advanced interventions.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Early transfer to the PICU is crucial for children with epiglottitis to ensure timely access to specialized care and prevent life-threatening complications."
    },
    "Administer Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV STAT.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is an appropriate and priority order. Acute epiglottitis is a bacterial infection (commonly *H. influenzae* type b, although less common due to vaccination, other bacteria can be responsible). Prompt administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics is critical to treating the underlying cause and preventing further complications.",
      "pathophysiology": "Bacterial infection leads to inflammation and edema of the epiglottis. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that targets common bacterial pathogens associated with epiglottitis, reducing bacterial load and inflammation.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Administer antibiotics as soon as possible after diagnosis to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of airway compromise. Consider local antibiotic resistance patterns when selecting the appropriate antibiotic."
    },
    "Obtain a throat culture for group A Streptococcus.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "This is the correct highlighted answer. This order is contraindicated and life-threatening. Any attempt to visualize the pharynx or use an instrument like a tongue depressor or culture swab can trigger a complete laryngospasm, leading to total airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. This procedure should never be performed outside of a controlled setting (like an operating room) where an emergency airway can be established immediately.",
      "pathophysiology": "Stimulation of the inflamed epiglottis can cause reflex laryngospasm, a sudden and forceful closure of the vocal cords. This can completely obstruct the airway, leading to hypoxia and respiratory arrest.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Avoid any unnecessary manipulation of the airway in a child with suspected epiglottitis. The 'look, listen, and observe' approach is crucial. Defer airway examination until a controlled environment with airway management expertise is available."
    },
    "Prepare for emergent intubation; notify anesthesiology and ENT.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is an appropriate and essential safety order. It demonstrates correct anticipation of the most severe complication of epiglottitis—airway loss. Mobilizing the expert teams for airway management is a key priority of care, not an error.",
      "pathophysiology": "Progressive swelling of the epiglottis can lead to critical narrowing of the airway, requiring emergent intubation to secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Early preparation for intubation is crucial. Anesthesiology and ENT specialists are essential for managing potentially difficult airways in children with epiglottitis. Have appropriately sized equipment readily available."
    },
    "Allow child to remain in a position of comfort with parents present.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This is an appropriate and therapeutic order. Forcing the child to lie down can worsen airway obstruction. Allowing them to maintain their position of comfort (typically tripod) minimizes respiratory effort and anxiety. Keeping parents present also reduces stress, which can help prevent agitation and further respiratory compromise.",
      "pathophysiology": "The tripod position maximizes airway diameter and reduces respiratory effort by utilizing accessory muscles. Anxiety and agitation can increase respiratory rate and oxygen demand, worsening respiratory distress.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Allowing the child to remain in a position of comfort can significantly improve respiratory status and reduce anxiety. Parental presence can provide reassurance and reduce agitation."
