    "correct": "The client is experiencing a life-threatening hyperkalemic emergency (K+ 7.8 mEq/L) evidenced by classic ECG changes (peaked T waves, wide QRS, bradycardia) that indicate severe cardiac membrane instability. In hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to dysrhythmias. Peaked T waves are an early sign, reflecting altered repolarization. As hyperkalemia worsens, it slows conduction through the heart, prolonging the PR interval and widening the QRS complex. Severe hyperkalemia can lead to ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which works by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. A key effect of this inhibition is a reduction in aldosterone, which normally promotes potassium excretion by increasing sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, indirectly stimulating potassium secretion. Administering an ACE inhibitor to a client with severe hyperkalemia is a critical contraindication as it will worsen the condition and increase the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmia or asystole. The nurse's priority safety action is to recognize this contraindication, withhold the medication, and immediately inform the provider. This action directly prevents iatrogenic harm in a critically unstable patient.",

        "justification": "This is an essential and correct *treatment* for hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity. Calcium gluconate works rapidly to stabilize the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of fatal dysrhythmias. Calcium does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart by increasing the threshold potential, making cardiac cells less excitable. While this medication must be given urgently, the question asks for the nurse's immediate *priority action*. The absolute priority in patient safety, according to the principle of 'do no harm,' is to first identify and stop any action that could worsen a life-threatening condition. Administering a contraindicated drug is a more critical error to prevent. -/+"

        "justification": "This is the correct 'SAFETY STOP' action. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can cause or exacerbate hyperkalemia by decreasing aldosterone production, thereby reducing urinary potassium excretion. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium and water retention and potassium excretion in the kidneys. Giving this drug to a patient with a K+ of 7.8 and active cardiotoxicity is a lethal contraindication. The nurse must recognize this severe risk, withhold the medication to prevent further harm, and communicate this critical finding to the provider. +/+"

        "justification": "While administering dextrose with insulin is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia, the client's current glucose is slightly elevated at 118 mg/dL. The standard protocol is to give insulin to shift potassium into cells, with dextrose given concurrently or immediately after to prevent a drop in blood sugar. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cells, promoting the uptake of potassium into cells, thereby lowering serum potassium levels. Dextrose is given to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin also promotes glucose uptake into cells. Debating the sequence is a minor process point compared to the life-threatening risk of administering a contraindicated medication. The immediate danger is cardiac arrest from potassium, not hypoglycemia. -/+"

Hemodialysis uses a semipermeable membrane to filter waste products and excess electrolytes, including potassium, from the blood. However, requesting this is a collaborative action that addresses the long-term solution. It is not the most *immediate* independent nursing priority. The nurse's first actions must focus on immediate stabilization and preventing iatrogenic harm. Withholding a dangerous medication is an independent nursing action that takes precedence over requesting the definitive treatment, which requires provider orders and coordination with a dialysis unit. -/+"
