      "rationale": "Highest priority. The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition. The pathophysiology involves air entering the pleural space without a means of escape, leading to increased intrapleural pressure. This increased pressure causes compression of the mediastinum, including the heart and great vessels, resulting in decreased venous return and cardiac output. The tracheal deviation, hypotension (92/58 mmHg), tachycardia (132 bpm), tachypnea (34 breaths/min), and hypoxia (88% on 6L NC) are all manifestations of this compression and impaired gas exchange. Elevated venous lactate (3.8 mmol/L) indicates anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoperfusion. Activating the RRT ensures immediate access to advanced medical expertise and resources for rapid diagnosis and intervention.",

      "rationale": "Following RRT activation, the next priority is to rapidly assess the chest tube system for any correctable mechanical issues. The vigorous, continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber indicates a significant air leak, which could be exacerbating the pneumothorax. Kinks, disconnections, or a malfunctioning drainage system can impede proper lung re-expansion and contribute to the tension pneumothorax. Addressing these issues promptly can potentially alleviate some of the pressure and improve the client's respiratory status while awaiting further intervention.",

This position utilizes gravity to promote lung expansion and reduce the work of breathing. By elevating the head of the bed, the diaphragm can descend more easily, allowing for improved ventilation and oxygenation. While this intervention does not address the underlying cause of the tension pneumothorax, it can provide symptomatic relief and improve the client's overall respiratory effort while awaiting definitive treatment.",

Needle decompression involves inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line to release the trapped air and relieve the pressure on the mediastinum. Chest tube reinsertion may be necessary if the existing chest tube is malfunctioning or improperly placed. Having the necessary equipment readily available ensures that the procedure can be performed promptly upon the arrival of the RRT or physician.",

The tension pneumothorax is causing obstructive shock by compressing the heart and great vessels, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. While fluid resuscitation is important to support circulation, it is a lower priority than addressing the underlying mechanical problem causing the shock. Relieving the pressure on the mediastinum through needle decompression or chest tube reinsertion is essential to restore adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.",
