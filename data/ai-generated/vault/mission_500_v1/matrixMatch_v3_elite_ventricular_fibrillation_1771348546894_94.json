The client was found unresponsive in his poorly heated apartment during a winter storm and experienced a witnessed ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in the field after two defibrillations. The client is intubated and sedated. The nurse is reviewing the client's electronic health record (EHR) and preparing to administer scheduled medications.",
