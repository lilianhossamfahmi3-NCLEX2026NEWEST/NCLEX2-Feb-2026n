The clinical data (tracheal deviation to the unaffected side, absent breath sounds, profound hypotension, tachycardia, JVD, and severe hypoxia) indicates that air is accumulating in the pleural space and is unable to escape. This is causing a mediastinal shift, which compresses the great vessels (vena cava) and the heart, leading to decreased venous return, drastically reduced cardiac output (obstructive shock), and cardiovascular collapse. Immediate, life-saving interventions are the priority.",

Administering it to a client who is already severely hypoxic (SpO2 82%), tachypneic (RR 38), and hemodynamically unstable (BP 78/45) could precipitate respiratory arrest and further cloud the neurologic assessment.

The development of a tension pneumothorax in a client with a chest tube suggests the tube is occluded (e.g., by a clot or kink) or there is a massive air leak that is overwhelming the system.
