The clinical data (tracheal deviation to the unaffected side, absent breath sounds, profound hypotension, tachycardia, JVD, and severe hypoxia) indicates that air is accumulating in the pleural space and is unable to escape. This increased intrapleural pressure causes a mediastinal shift, compressing the great vessels (vena cava) and the heart. This compression reduces venous return, drastically reducing cardiac output (obstructive shock), and leading to cardiovascular collapse. Immediate, life-saving interventions are the priority.",

Administering it to a client who is already severely hypoxic (SpO2 82%), tachypneic (RR 38), and hemodynamically unstable (BP 78/45) could precipitate respiratory arrest and further cloud the neurologic assessment. The priority is resuscitation, not pain management. Morphine binds to opioid receptors in the brainstem, reducing the respiratory drive and sensitivity to carbon dioxide. This can worsen hypoventilation and lead to respiratory failure in a client with already compromised respiratory function.&#x20;"

Raising the head of the bed would cause a precipitous drop in cerebral perfusion and could lead to syncope or cardiovascular collapse. The client should be kept supine or in a low-Fowler's position to maximize venous return and cardiac output. In a client with obstructive shock, maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion is paramount. Raising the head of the bed can exacerbate hypotension and compromise blood flow to the brain.&#x20;"

The nurse should anticipate this provider-performed procedure by gathering the necessary equipment (a large-bore needle, typically 14-gauge) and preparing the landmark site (2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line). This action demonstrates anticipation and readiness to facilitate a time-critical intervention. Needle decompression converts a tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, allowing the trapped air to escape and restoring hemodynamic stability. The procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle into the pleural space to release the built-up pressure.&#x20;"

          "justification": "The client's SpO2 is 82% despite being on 2L of oxygen, indicating profound hypoxemia. Maximizing oxygen delivery is a critical resuscitative measure to support vital organs while the underlying cause of shock is being addressed. A non-rebreather mask can deliver the highest possible concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In a tension pneumothorax, the compressed lung tissue is unable to effectively participate in gas exchange, leading to severe hypoxemia. Providing 100% oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, maximizing oxygen uptake by the remaining functional lung tissue.&#x20;"

The development of a tension pneumothorax in a client with a chest tube suggests the tube is occluded (e.g., by a clot or kink) or there is a massive air leak that is overwhelming the system. Simply increasing suction will not resolve the occlusion and does not address the trapped air in the pleural space that is causing the hemodynamic collapse. The priority is to relieve the pressure immediately. Increasing suction may even worsen the air leak if the chest tube is malfunctioning. The underlying problem is the inability of air to escape from the pleural space, not inadequate drainage.&#x20;"
