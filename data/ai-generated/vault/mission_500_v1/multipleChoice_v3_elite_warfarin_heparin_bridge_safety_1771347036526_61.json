The client is being bridged from a continuous unfractionated heparin infusion to oral warfarin. The nurse is preparing to administer the 1700 dose of warfarin and has the following data.

The client has a diagnosed acute subdural hematoma on the head CT. The new onset of headache, drowsiness, slowed speech, rising blood pressure, and falling heart rate (Cushing's triad precursors) are critical signs of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) from an expanding bleed. Continuing anticoagulation therapy is absolutely contraindicated and would likely be fatal. The nurse's priority independent action is to stop the source of the problem (hold warfarin, stop heparin) and immediately escalate to the provider for urgent intervention.",

While the INR and aPTT are within the desired therapeutic range for DVT treatment, the presence of an acute intracranial bleed on the CT scan and new neurological changes makes administering any further anticoagulants a life-threatening error. This is a classic 'tunnel vision' error, focusing only on the target labs without considering the complete patient picture."

While the situation is serious, the client is not yet in overt crisis (e.g., seizure, coma, posturing) that would necessitate a Rapid Response Team (RRT) activation before notifying the primary provider. The most critical first steps are stopping the anticoagulants and informing the provider who can order imaging and neurosurgical consult. Preparing protamine sulfate is anticipatory but not the first action, and the provider must order it."

The nurse must 'Stop the line' by withholding the warfarin and stopping the heparin infusion to prevent worsening the intracranial bleed. Immediate notification of the provider is the next critical step to initiate emergency management, which may include a STAT head CT, neurosurgery consult, and reversal agents."

Administering oral warfarin, which has a long half-life, continues the anticoagulation process. Merely decreasing the heparin infusion is insufficient; it must be stopped entirely in the setting of an active intracranial bleed with signs of worsening ICP. Both medications must be held."
