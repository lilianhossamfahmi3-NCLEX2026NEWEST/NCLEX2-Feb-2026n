The new headache, drowsiness, slowed speech, rising BP, and decreasing HR suggest increasing intracranial pressure (ICP). These are precursors to Cushing's triad, indicating potential brain herniation. Continuing anticoagulation is contraindicated and could be fatal. The priority is to stop the anticoagulants (warfarin and heparin) and immediately notify the provider for urgent intervention. Increased ICP occurs as the hematoma expands, compressing brain tissue. This triggers a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion, leading to increased systolic blood pressure. The bradycardia is a reflex response to the elevated BP. Slowed speech and drowsiness indicate impaired neurological function due to compression.",
