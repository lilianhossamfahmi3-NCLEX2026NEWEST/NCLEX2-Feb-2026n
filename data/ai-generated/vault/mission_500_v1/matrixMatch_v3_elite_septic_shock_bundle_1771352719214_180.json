            "col1": "Correct. This is the critical safety stop. The combination of severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) and ECG changes (peaked T-waves) indicates cardiac membrane instability, a life-threatening emergency. Lactated Ringer's contains potassium, making it contraindicated. Administering it would worsen the hyperkalemia and could precipitate a fatal arrhythmia. The nurse's priority is to immediately withhold this fluid and question the provider, advocating for an alternative like 0.9% sodium chloride.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. While vasopressors are needed for the hypotension, addressing the immediate life-threat of hyperkalemia by preventing administration of more potassium is a more urgent safety action related to this specific cue.",
            "col3": "Incorrect. Antibiotics are essential for sepsis but do not address the immediate cardiac risk posed by severe hyperkalemia.",
            "col4": "Incorrect. While the client will ultimately need dialysis, it is not an immediate independent nursing action. The priority nursing action is to prevent iatrogenic harm by withholding the contraindicated fluid.",
            "col5": "Incorrect. Oxygen is needed for hypoxia, but this specific finding of hyperkalemia points to a different, more immediate threat related to the ordered medications."

        "row2": {
            "col1": "Incorrect. Withholding fluids is not the priority action for refractory hypotension. The client needs hemodynamic support.",
            "col2": "Correct. The client's blood pressure has not responded and has worsened after the initial fluid bolus, indicating refractory septic shock. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg is insufficient for organ perfusion. The provider's order is to initiate norepinephrine, a vasopressor, to increase systemic vascular resistance and raise the MAP to a target of ≥ 65 mmHg.",
            "col3": "Incorrect. Antibiotics treat the underlying infection but will not correct the immediate hemodynamic instability.",
            "col4": "Incorrect. Dialysis will help with fluid and electrolyte balance long-term, but vasopressors are required to manage the acute shock state.",
            "col5": "Incorrect. While the client is hypoxic, the primary cause of the refractory hypotension is vasodilation from sepsis, which must be treated with vasopressors."

            "col3": "Correct. The fever and elevated white blood cell count are classic signs of infection and the systemic inflammatory response. A key component of the sepsis bundle is the rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the source of infection, which is the priority action for these specific findings.",

            "col2": "Correct. A lactate level greater than 4 mmol/L is indicative of severe sepsis and significant tissue hypoperfusion. This, combined with the persistent hypotension, reinforces the need for vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to improve MAP and restore perfusion to vital organs, which will in turn help clear the lactate.",

This could be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis or early pulmonary edema from aggressive fluid resuscitation in a patient with a compromised heart. The priority nursing action is to correct the hypoxemia by applying a high-flow oxygen delivery system to prevent further respiratory decompensation."
