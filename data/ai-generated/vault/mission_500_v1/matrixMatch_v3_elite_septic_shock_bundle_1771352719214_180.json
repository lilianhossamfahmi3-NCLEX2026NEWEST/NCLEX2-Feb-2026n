The peaked T-waves on the ECG further confirm the presence of hyperkalemia and its effect on cardiac conduction. Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution contains potassium (typically 4 mEq/L). Administering LR would exacerbate the hyperkalemia, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The priority nursing action is to withhold the LR infusion and immediately clarify the fluid order with the provider, advocating for a potassium-free alternative such as 0.9% sodium chloride. This prevents iatrogenic harm and protects the client's cardiac stability.",

        "rationale": "Correct. The client's blood pressure of 84/48 mmHg after the initial fluid bolus indicates refractory septic shock. This means the hypotension is not responding to fluid resuscitation alone. The provider's order is to initiate norepinephrine, a potent vasopressor, to increase systemic vascular resistance and raise the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to a target of ≥ 65 mmHg. Norepinephrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure. A MAP of at least 65 mmHg is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.",

The fever (39.1°C) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC 18.5 x 10³/μL) are classic signs of infection and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with sepsis. A key component of the sepsis bundle is the rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to target the source of infection.

This, combined with the persistent hypotension, reinforces the need for vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to improve MAP and restore perfusion to vital organs, which will in turn help clear the lactate. Lactate is produced by anaerobic metabolism when tissues are not receiving enough oxygen. Improving perfusion will allow tissues to return to aerobic metabolism and reduce lactate production.",
