The nurse's assessment reveals a clamped chest tube, which is the cause of the obstruction. This clamp prevents air and fluid from escaping the pleural space, causing intrapleural pressure to rise, which compresses the lung and shifts the mediastinum (trachea, heart, great vessels). This shift obstructs venous return to the heart, causing obstructive shock. The immediate, life-saving priority is to relieve the obstruction by unclamping the tube. This is an independent nursing action that directly resolves the cause of the crisis.",

Proceeding with any action other than resolving the chest tube obstruction allows the tension pneumothorax to worsen, leading to imminent cardiovascular collapse.",

Administering morphine, a potent opioid analgesic with respiratory depressant and hypotensive effects, to a patient in obstructive shock and respiratory distress is extremely dangerous.

Unclamping the tube is a simple, independent nursing intervention that will immediately allow the trapped air to escape, decompressing the pleural space, allowing the lung to re-expand, and resolving the mediastinal shift and obstructive shock.
