A student nurse has just finished tidying the patient's bedside. The nurse performs an assessment and plans to administer a scheduled analgesic. Which action is the nurse's **immediate** priority?",

    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition. The clamped chest tube is the direct cause. A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space (between the lung and chest wall) with each inspiration but cannot escape. This leads to increased intrapleural pressure, causing the affected lung to collapse. As pressure continues to rise, it shifts the mediastinum (heart, trachea, great vessels) to the opposite side of the chest. This shift compresses the unaffected lung and obstructs venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. The absence of tidaling in the water seal chamber, along with the patient's respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability, strongly suggests a tension pneumothorax caused by the clamped tube. Unclamping the tube is the immediate priority to relieve the pressure.",

Given the patient's already compromised respiratory status (SpO2 87% on 2L NC, RR 34) and hypotension (BP 88/50), morphine could exacerbate these issues and lead to further decompensation. The priority is to address the underlying cause of the respiratory distress and hypotension first.",

        "justification": "While increasing oxygen is a reasonable intervention for hypoxia, it does not address the underlying mechanical problem of the tension pneumothorax. The lung is being compressed and cannot expand effectively, so simply increasing the FiO2 will not resolve the issue. This action may provide a temporary improvement in oxygen saturation, but it will not prevent further deterioration. The priority is to relieve the pressure in the pleural space.",

Unclamping the tube will immediately relieve the pressure, allowing the lung to re-expand and improving venous return to the heart. Straightening the tubing ensures there are no kinks or obstructions that could further impede drainage. This is a simple, independent nursing intervention that can be performed immediately to stabilize the patient.",

The nurse has identified a reversible cause for the patient's distress (the clamped chest tube) and can address it immediately. Delaying the unclamping of the tube to call the RRT wastes critical time. Needle decompression is a more invasive procedure that may be necessary if unclamping the tube does not resolve the tension pneumothorax, but it is not the first-line intervention in this scenario.",
