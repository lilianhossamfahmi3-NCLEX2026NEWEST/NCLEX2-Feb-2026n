      "rationale": "Correct. The client's blood pressure remains elevated at 188/108 mmHg despite interventions. According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines, a blood pressure consistently above 185/110 mmHg is an absolute contraindication to Alteplase (tPA) administration. Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation following thrombolytic therapy.",
      "points": 1
    },
    "opt1_2": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. A lumbar puncture within the past 7 days is a relative contraindication for tPA due to the potential for bleeding at the puncture site. However, uncontrolled hypertension poses a more immediate and life-threatening risk. Addressing the blood pressure is the priority.",
      "points": 0
    },
    "opt1_3": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While elevated blood glucose should be addressed, it is not an absolute contraindication to tPA administration. Hyperglycemia is common in acute stroke and managed concurrently with stroke treatment. The uncontrolled hypertension presents a greater immediate risk.",
      "points": 0
    },
    "opt1_4": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Early ischemic changes on CT are expected in acute ischemic stroke and support the use of tPA if no contraindications are present. These changes indicate the presence of potentially salvageable brain tissue.",
      "points": 0
    },
    "opt2_1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Alteplase (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent that dissolves blood clots. In the setting of uncontrolled hypertension, the fragile blood vessels in the brain are at a significantly increased risk of rupture. The combination of thrombolysis and high blood pressure dramatically elevates the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a devastating complication that can lead to permanent disability or death.",
      "points": 1
    },
    "opt2_2": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client received a non-contrast CT scan, so there was no exposure to contrast dye. Therefore, the risk of an allergic reaction to contrast is not applicable in this scenario.",
      "points": 0
    },
    "opt2_3": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a potential complication of severe hypertension, characterized by cerebral edema and neurological dysfunction. While the client's blood pressure is concerning, the immediate risk associated with administering tPA in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension is intracerebral hemorrhage.",
      "points": 0
    },
    "opt2_4": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The goal of tPA is to reperfuse the ischemic penumbra (the area of potentially salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct). While there are risks associated with tPA administration, the primary concern in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension is the increased risk of bleeding, not worsening ischemia.",

    },
    "opt3_1": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering tPA with a blood pressure above 185/110 mmHg is contraindicated and constitutes a medication error. Doing so places the client at a significantly increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and neurological deterioration.",

    "opt3_2": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The nurse must withhold the tPA and immediately notify the provider of the uncontrolled hypertension. This is a critical safety measure to prevent a potentially fatal complication. The provider needs to be informed that the client's blood pressure is not within the acceptable range for tPA administration and requires further management.",
      "points": 1
    },
    "opt3_3": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While requesting an order for a continuous antihypertensive infusion (e.g., nicardipine) may be an appropriate intervention to manage the client's blood pressure, the priority action is to withhold the tPA and notify the provider. Initiating antihypertensive therapy is a collaborative intervention that follows the immediate safety measure of withholding the contraindicated medication.",

  "clinicalPearl": "Strict adherence to blood pressure guidelines is crucial before and during tPA administration for acute ischemic stroke. Uncontrolled hypertension is an absolute contraindication due to the increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Always verify blood pressure parameters and other contraindications before administering tPA. The AHA/ASA guidelines provide specific recommendations for blood pressure management in acute stroke.",

    "assessment": "Client's blood pressure remains elevated at 188/108 mmHg despite two doses of IV labetalol at 0815 and 0830. Non-contrast CT shows no hemorrhage but indicates early ischemia.",
    "recommendation": "Recommend withholding Alteplase (tPA) at this time due to uncontrolled hypertension, an absolute contraindication. Further blood pressure management is needed. Re-evaluate for tPA eligibility once blood pressure is below 185/110 mmHg per AHA/ASA guidelines."
