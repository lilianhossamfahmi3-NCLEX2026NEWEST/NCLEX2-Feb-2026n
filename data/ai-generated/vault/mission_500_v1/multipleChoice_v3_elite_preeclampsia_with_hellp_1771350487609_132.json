      "opt_01": "**Incorrect.** Administering the Lactated Ringer's bolus is contraindicated and potentially dangerous. The client exhibits signs of developing pulmonary edema (dyspnea, cough, decreasing SpO2).\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome cause endothelial damage, increasing capillary permeability. This leads to fluid shifting from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, including the lungs. A fluid bolus exacerbates this fluid shift, worsening pulmonary edema and potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** New onset dyspnea, cough, and decreasing SpO2 in a preeclamptic patient should immediately raise suspicion for pulmonary edema. Rapid fluid administration is contraindicated.\n",
      "opt_02": "**Incorrect.** The client's magnesium level (6.5 mg/dL) is within the therapeutic range, and DTRs are present. Respiratory depression is a sign of magnesium toxicity, but the client is tachypneic, not bradypneic.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia. Toxicity can manifest as respiratory depression, decreased DTRs, and altered mental status. However, these signs are not present in this case.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess magnesium levels and signs of toxicity (decreased DTRs, respiratory depression) before adjusting the magnesium infusion rate. This client's presentation is more indicative of pulmonary edema than magnesium toxicity.\n",
      "opt_03": "**Correct.** The client's symptoms (dyspnea, cough, decreasing SpO2, tachypnea) strongly suggest pulmonary edema, a life-threatening complication of HELLP syndrome. The pending fluid bolus is contraindicated and should be withheld. The provider must be notified immediately.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 32-year-old female, 34 weeks gestation with severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, experiencing increasing shortness of breath and new cough.\n*   **Background:** Admitted for management of severe preeclampsia/HELLP. Receiving magnesium sulfate. Lactated Ringer's bolus ordered STAT.\n*   **Assessment:** RR 24, SpO2 94%, reports dyspnea and chest tightness. Labs show thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/LDH, and creatinine of 1.4. Magnesium level is therapeutic.\n*   **Recommendation:** Recommend withholding the Lactated Ringer's bolus due to suspected pulmonary edema and notify the provider immediately for further orders. Consider oxygen administration and further evaluation of respiratory status.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count) is a severe complication of preeclampsia. Endothelial damage leads to increased vascular permeability and fluid shifts. Pulmonary edema occurs when fluid accumulates in the lungs, impairing gas exchange.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Pulmonary edema is a critical complication of preeclampsia/HELLP. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to prevent respiratory failure.\n",
      "opt_04": "**Incorrect.** While managing hypertension is important, the client's current blood pressure (158/98 mmHg) does not meet the parameters for PRN labetalol administration (SBP > 160 or DBP > 110). The immediate priority is addressing the respiratory compromise.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Labetalol is an antihypertensive medication used to lower blood pressure in preeclampsia. While hypertension contributes to the overall pathophysiology of preeclampsia, the acute respiratory distress is the more immediate threat.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). In this case, addressing the respiratory distress takes precedence over administering antihypertensive medication."
