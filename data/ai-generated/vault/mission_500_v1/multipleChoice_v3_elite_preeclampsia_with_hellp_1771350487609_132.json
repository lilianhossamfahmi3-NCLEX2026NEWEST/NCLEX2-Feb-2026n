            "opt_01": "This action is incorrect and potentially lethal. The client's increasing respiratory rate, decreasing SpO2, and new-onset dyspnea with a cough are hallmark signs of developing pulmonary edema. Severe preeclampsia and HELLP cause systemic endothelial dysfunction, leading to 'leaky' capillaries. Administering a rapid fluid bolus would increase hydrostatic pressure and force more fluid into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, precipitating acute respiratory failure. This is a critical 'DON'T PROCEED' situation.",
            "opt_02": "This action is incorrect. While respiratory depression is a sign of magnesium toxicity, the client's respiratory rate is elevated (tachypnea), not depressed (bradypnea). Furthermore, the serum magnesium level is within the therapeutic range (6.5 mg/dL), and deep tendon reflexes are present at +2, not absent. The clinical picture points to pulmonary edema from the disease process, not magnesium toxicity.",
            "opt_03": "This is the correct and priority action. The synthesis of cues—tachypnea (RR 24), falling SpO2 (94%), and the client's subjective report of dyspnea and chest tightness—strongly indicates pulmonary edema, a life-threatening complication of HELLP syndrome. The pending fluid bolus is contraindicated as it will worsen the fluid shift into the lungs. The nurse's primary responsibility is to first prevent harm by withholding the bolus ('SAFETY STOP') and then immediately escalate care by notifying the provider of the critical respiratory change.",
            "opt_04": "This action is incorrect. The client's current blood pressure (158/98 mmHg) does not meet the parameters specified in the MAR for administering PRN labetalol (SBP > 160 or DBP > 110). While managing hypertension is important in preeclampsia, the immediate life threat is the developing respiratory compromise, not the blood pressure at this moment. Administering an unnecessary medication diverts attention from the critical issue."
