He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation 48 hours ago. Currently sedated and receiving neuromuscular blockade. Goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance to improve pulmonary edema.\n\n**0800:** Client is sedated and unresponsive to stimuli. Endotracheal tube secure. Bilateral breath sounds with coarse crackles throughout. Chest expansion symmetrical. Ventilator settings: AC/VC, FiO2 60%, PEEP 12 cm H2O, TV 420 mL. SpO2 92%. Infusions of propofol, cisatracurium, and norepinephrine are running.\n\n**0845:** High pressure alarm sounding from the ventilator. Client's SpO2 rapidly dropped to 84% on the monitor. Nurse observes that chest expansion appears diminished on the right side compared to the left. Client is tachycardic and hypotensive."

While the client is hypotensive (MAP 56) and the norepinephrine protocol allows for titration, this action only addresses a symptom (hypotension) without addressing the root cause. The acute spike in Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and unilateral diminished chest expansion strongly suggest a mechanical problem like a pneumothorax, which requires a definitive intervention, not just more vasopressors."

The constellation of a sudden, dramatic spike in PIP to 55, profound desaturation, acute hypotension, and asymmetrical chest movement points toward a barotrauma event like a pneumothorax, not a simple obstruction. Suctioning would delay the life-saving intervention."

The cluster of cues (sudden SpO2 drop to 84%, PIP spike from 35 to 55, onset of severe hypotension/tachycardia, and diminished chest rise on the right) is a classic presentation of a tension pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated client. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention (e.g., needle decompression, chest tube insertion). The nurse's first and most critical action is to activate the team to address this life-threatening complication."
