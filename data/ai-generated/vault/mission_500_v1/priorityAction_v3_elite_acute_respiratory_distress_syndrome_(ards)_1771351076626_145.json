He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation 48 hours ago. Currently sedated and receiving neuromuscular blockade. Goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance to improve pulmonary edema.\n\n**0800:** Client is sedated and unresponsive to stimuli. Endotracheal tube secure. Bilateral breath sounds with coarse crackles throughout. Chest expansion symmetrical. Ventilator settings: AC/VC, FiO2 60%, PEEP 12 cm H2O, TV 420 mL. SpO2 92%. Infusions of propofol, cisatracurium, and norepinephrine are running.\n\n**0845:** High pressure alarm sounding from the ventilator. Client's SpO2 rapidly dropped to 84% on the monitor. Nurse observes that chest expansion appears diminished on the right side compared to the left. Client is tachycardic and hypotensive."

      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Administering furosemide is contraindicated at this time. The client is experiencing acute decompensation with severe hypotension (MAP 56 mmHg). Administering a diuretic would cause further fluid loss, worsen hypotension, and potentially accelerate cardiovascular collapse. In ARDS, a negative fluid balance is often desired to reduce pulmonary edema; however, it is not appropriate when the patient is hemodynamically unstable. The priority is to address the acute respiratory distress and hypotension before considering diuresis.\n\n*Pathophysiology:* Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased water excretion. In a hypotensive state, this further reduces circulating volume, exacerbating hypotension and potentially compromising organ perfusion.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Always assess hemodynamic stability before administering diuretics, especially in patients with ARDS. Hypotension is a contraindication until the underlying cause is addressed.",

      "rationale": "While the client is hypotensive (MAP 56 mmHg) and the norepinephrine protocol allows for titration, this action only addresses a symptom (hypotension) without addressing the underlying cause of the acute decompensation. The sudden spike in Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and unilateral diminished chest expansion strongly suggest a mechanical problem, such as a pneumothorax or displaced endotracheal tube, which requires immediate definitive intervention, not just more vasopressors. Increasing the norepinephrine infusion would delay the necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\n*Pathophysiology:* Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that increases blood pressure by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction. While it can temporarily improve blood pressure, it does not address the underlying respiratory compromise.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Treat the underlying cause, not just the symptoms. A sudden change in respiratory status with hypotension requires immediate investigation for mechanical issues. Increasing vasopressors without addressing the root cause can mask the problem and delay appropriate treatment.",

      "rationale": "While a mucus plug can cause a high-pressure alarm, the complete clinical picture makes this less likely to be the primary cause. The constellation of a sudden, dramatic spike in PIP to 55 cm H2O, profound desaturation (SpO2 84%), acute hypotension (MAP 56 mmHg), and asymmetrical chest movement points toward a barotrauma event like a pneumothorax, or potentially a displaced endotracheal tube, not a simple obstruction. Suctioning would delay the life-saving intervention of notifying the provider and respiratory therapist for further evaluation and intervention.\n\n*Pathophysiology:* Increased airway resistance, such as from a mucus plug, can trigger a high-pressure alarm. However, the rapid deterioration and asymmetrical chest movement are more indicative of a pneumothorax, where air leaks into the pleural space, compressing the lung and impairing ventilation.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Consider the entire clinical picture. A high-pressure alarm requires a systematic assessment to determine the underlying cause. In this case, the rapid deterioration suggests a more serious problem than a simple mucus plug. Always assess for signs of pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated patients with sudden respiratory decline.",

      "rationale": "This is the priority action. The cluster of cues (sudden SpO2 drop to 84%, PIP spike from 35 to 55 cm H2O, onset of severe hypotension/tachycardia, and diminished chest rise on the right) is a classic presentation of a tension pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated client. A tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention (e.g., needle decompression, chest tube insertion). The nurse's first and most critical action is to activate the team (provider and respiratory therapist) to address this life-threatening complication.\n\n*Pathophysiology:* A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased pressure that compresses the lung, shifts the mediastinum, and impairs venous return to the heart, resulting in hypotension and respiratory failure. Positive pressure ventilation can exacerbate this condition.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* A tension pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated patient is a life-threatening emergency. Rapid recognition and intervention are crucial for survival. Be vigilant for sudden changes in respiratory status, especially in patients on positive pressure ventilation.",
