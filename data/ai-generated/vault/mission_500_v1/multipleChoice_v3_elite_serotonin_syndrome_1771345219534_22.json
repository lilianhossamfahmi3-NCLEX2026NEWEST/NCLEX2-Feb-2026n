Withholding the offending medication and urgently notifying the provider to initiate emergency treatment is the critical independent nursing action to prevent further deterioration.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Serotonin syndrome results from excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system. This leads to a cascade of effects, including autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia, tachycardia), neuromuscular hyperactivity (e.g., clonus, hyperreflexia), and altered mental status. Rhabdomyolysis, indicated by elevated CK, occurs due to sustained muscle contractions and rigidity, leading to muscle breakdown and release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. This can cause acute kidney injury as the kidneys attempt to filter the large molecules.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Serotonin syndrome is a medical emergency. Early recognition and immediate intervention, including discontinuation of serotonergic agents and supportive care, are crucial to prevent severe complications such as rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and death.",
