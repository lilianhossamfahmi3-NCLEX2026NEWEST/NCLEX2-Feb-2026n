Reports dyspnea at rest. Lungs with crackles 1/2 way up bilaterally. 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities. Skin is pale, cool, and diaphoretic. S1 and S2 heart sounds audible, with an S3 gallop noted. Abdomen soft, non-distended.\n\n**0930:** Client has become increasingly restless and is confused to time and place.

            "A1": "Incorrect. Administering furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is contraindicated and extremely dangerous in this client. The client is severely hypotensive (82/58), has an acute kidney injury (BUN 48, Cr 2.5), and has critical, life-threatening hypokalemia (K+ 2.4 mEq/L). Furosemide would further decrease blood pressure, worsen renal perfusion, and exacerbate the hypokalemia, likely precipitating a fatal cardiac arrhythmia, especially given the existing PVCs.",
            "A2": "Correct. This is the critical 'Safety Stop' action. The nurse must recognize the multiple contraindications to administering furosemide: severe hypotension, acute kidney injury, and life-threatening hypokalemia. Withholding the medication and immediately notifying the provider of these critical findings is the priority nursing action to prevent patient harm.",
            "A3": "Incorrect. The client is in cardiogenic shock, not hypovolemic shock. They are already fluid-overloaded, as evidenced by lung crackles, S3 gallop, and elevated BNP. A fluid bolus would increase preload on an already failing heart, worsening pulmonary edema and cardiac function.",
            "A4": "Incorrect. While the client is in respiratory distress and may eventually require intubation, this is not the most immediate independent nursing action. The nurse must first address the medication order that poses an immediate threat of causing a cardiac arrest. This is a collaborative action that requires a provider's order and a team.",
            "A5": "Correct Action, Incorrect Priority. While the potassium infusion is essential and should be started, the absolute priority is to first prevent the administration of a medication (furosemide) that would make the hypokalemia and hypotension catastrophically worse. The primary rule is 'do no harm'. Preventing the error is the first step before initiating corrective treatment."

        "condition": {
            "C1": "Correct. The client's presentation is classic for cardiogenic shock: evidence of severe cardiac dysfunction (EF 15-20%, elevated troponin/BNP), hypotension (BP 82/58), tachycardia (HR 138), and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (confusion, low urine output, elevated lactate, AKI).",
            "C2": "Incorrect. There are no signs of a systemic infection (e.g., fever, elevated WBC count) to suggest septic shock. The cause of shock is cardiac pump failure.",
            "C3": "Incorrect. While the client has hypoxemia and bilateral lung crackles, ARDS is a type of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This client's respiratory failure is a direct consequence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema from severe heart failure.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. The client's signs (crackles, edema, S3, high BNP) point to fluid overload, not fluid deficit. The cause of shock is pump failure, not low volume.",
            "C5": "Incorrect. There is no history of allergen exposure or signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, wheezing) to suggest anaphylaxis."

            "P1": "Correct. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is a critical parameter for assessing tissue perfusion and is the primary target for vasopressor therapy (e.g., norepinephrine) in cardiogenic shock. A MAP of >65 mmHg is typically the goal.",
            "P2": "Correct. The client has life-threatening hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) and ventricular ectopy. Correcting and closely monitoring the serum potassium level is a top priority to prevent fatal dysrhythmias and stabilize cardiac electrical activity.",
            "P3": "Correct. Urine output is a key indicator of renal and systemic perfusion. An increase in urine output would signify improved cardiac output and response to therapy, while continued oliguria would indicate worsening shock.",
            "P4": "Incorrect. While stress hyperglycemia can occur in critical illness, monitoring blood glucose is not a primary parameter for assessing this client's specific hemodynamic instability and electrolyte crisis.",
            "P5": "Incorrect. The client is afebrile and slightly hypothermic, consistent with poor perfusion. While temperature is part of routine monitoring, it is not a priority parameter for evaluating the immediate response to interventions for cardiogenic shock.",
            "P6": "Incorrect. Abdominal girth is monitored for conditions like ascites or bowel obstruction, which are not relevant to the immediate management of this client's cardiogenic shock.",
            "P7": "Incorrect. While a change in pupillary response can indicate severe cerebral hypoperfusion or herniation, monitoring for subtle changes is less of a priority than monitoring direct indicators of cardiac output and perfusion like MAP and urine output. The client's confusion is already a sign of cerebral hypoperfusion."
