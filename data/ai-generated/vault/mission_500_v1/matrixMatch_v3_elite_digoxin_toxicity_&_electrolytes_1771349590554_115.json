            "col1": "Correct. Hypokalemia (Potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) is a critical finding that significantly potentiates the effects of digoxin on the myocardium, increasing the risk and severity of toxicity even with therapeutic drug levels. The client's K+ of 2.9 mEq/L is a major contributor to their toxic state.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. Hypokalemia itself is an electrolyte imbalance, not a direct indicator of renal impairment. Renal impairment is indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine.",
            "col3": "Correct. The presence of significant hypokalemia is a major safety concern that necessitates withholding the scheduled dose of digoxin, as administering it would worsen the life-threatening cardiotoxicity."
        },
        "row2": {
            "col1": "Correct. Digoxin has a negative chronotropic effect (slows heart rate). Severe bradycardia (HR < 60/min), especially a rate of 48/min, is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity as the drug's effect on the sinoatrial (SA) node becomes excessive.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. Bradycardia is a cardiovascular sign, not a direct indicator of renal function. While renal impairment can cause digoxin toxicity which leads to bradycardia, the heart rate itself does not indicate the state of the kidneys.",
            "col3": "Correct. An apical heart rate below 60/min is a standard parameter for withholding digoxin. A rate of 48/min is a definitive 'STOP' sign, requiring the nurse to hold the medication and notify the provider immediately."

        "row3": {
            "col1": "Correct. Visual disturbances, specifically xanthopsia (seeing yellow-green halos around objects), are a classic, though less common, neurotoxic symptom of digoxin toxicity.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. Visual disturbances like xanthopsia are specific to digoxin toxicity and are not associated with renal impairment itself.",
            "col3": "Correct. The client's report of a hallmark symptom of toxicity is a clear indication that administering more of the drug would be dangerous. This finding mandates withholding the medication."
        },
        "row4": {
            "col1": "Correct. Elevated BUN and Creatinine indicate renal impairment. Since digoxin is primarily cleared by the kidneys, poor renal function leads to drug accumulation and is a primary risk factor for developing toxicity. The client's high levels confirm this risk factor is present and contributing to the toxic state.",
            "col2": "Correct. Elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine are the hallmark laboratory indicators of impaired kidney function (renal impairment).",
            "col3": "Correct. The evidence of poor renal clearance means the client cannot effectively excrete the drug. Administering another dose would raise the blood level further into a dangerous range, so the medication must be withheld."
        },
        "row5": {
            "col1": "Correct. Digoxin slows conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node. In toxicity, this effect is exaggerated and can manifest as a first-degree AV block (PR interval > 0.20 seconds) or progress to more severe heart blocks. The client's PR interval of 0.24 seconds is a sign of toxic effect on the heart's conduction system.",
            "col2": "Incorrect. AV block is a cardiac conduction abnormality and not a direct indicator of renal function, although it can be caused by the digoxin toxicity that resulted from renal impairment.",
            "col3": "Correct. Evidence of cardiotoxicity on the ECG, such as a new or worsening AV block, is an absolute contraindication to administering the next dose of digoxin. The nurse must withhold the dose to prevent progression to a life-threatening complete heart block."
