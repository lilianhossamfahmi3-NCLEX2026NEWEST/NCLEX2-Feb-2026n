  "answerBreakdown": {
    "row1": {
      "col1": "Correct. Hypokalemia (Potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) significantly increases digoxin's effects on the myocardium, raising the risk of toxicity even at therapeutic levels. Low potassium enhances digoxin binding to Na+/K+-ATPase, inhibiting its function and disrupting cellular ion gradients, leading to arrhythmias and other toxic effects. The client's K+ of 2.9 mEq/L is a major contributor to digoxin toxicity.",
      "col2": "Incorrect. Hypokalemia is an electrolyte imbalance, not a direct indicator of renal impairment. Renal impairment is indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine, which reflect the kidney's reduced ability to filter waste products.",
      "col3": "Correct. Significant hypokalemia necessitates withholding digoxin. Administering digoxin with low potassium can precipitate life-threatening cardiotoxicity due to increased digoxin binding and enhanced inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase in cardiac cells."
    },
    "row2": {
      "col1": "Correct. Digoxin has a negative chronotropic effect, slowing the heart rate by increasing vagal tone and decreasing sympathetic activity at the sinoatrial (SA) node. Severe bradycardia (HR < 60/min), especially a rate of 48/min, is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity as the drug's effect on the SA node becomes excessive, potentially leading to sinus arrest or AV block.",
      "col2": "Incorrect. Bradycardia is a cardiovascular sign, not a direct indicator of renal function. While renal impairment can cause digoxin toxicity, which leads to bradycardia, the heart rate itself does not indicate the state of the kidneys.",
      "col3": "Correct. An apical heart rate below 60/min is a standard parameter for withholding digoxin. A rate of 48/min is a definitive 'STOP' sign, requiring the nurse to hold the medication and notify the provider immediately to prevent further slowing of the heart rate and potential cardiac arrest."
    },
    "row3": {
      "col1": "Correct. Visual disturbances, specifically xanthopsia (seeing yellow-green halos around objects), are a classic, though less common, neurotoxic symptom of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin affects the central nervous system, altering color perception and causing these characteristic visual changes due to interference with retinal function.",
      "col2": "Incorrect. Visual disturbances like xanthopsia are specific to digoxin toxicity and are not associated with renal impairment itself.",
      "col3": "Correct. The client's report of a hallmark symptom of toxicity is a clear indication that administering more of the drug would be dangerous. This finding mandates withholding the medication to prevent further neurotoxic effects and potential seizures."
    },
    "row4": {
      "col1": "Correct. Elevated BUN and Creatinine indicate renal impairment. Since digoxin is primarily cleared by the kidneys, poor renal function leads to drug accumulation and is a primary risk factor for developing toxicity. Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) impairs digoxin excretion, increasing its serum concentration and the risk of adverse effects. The client's high levels confirm this risk factor is present and contributing to the toxic state.",
      "col2": "Correct. Elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine are the hallmark laboratory indicators of impaired kidney function (renal impairment). BUN reflects the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood, while creatinine is a waste product from muscle metabolism; both are normally filtered by the kidneys.",
      "col3": "Correct. The evidence of poor renal clearance means the client cannot effectively excrete the drug. Administering another dose would raise the blood level further into a dangerous range, so the medication must be withheld to prevent further accumulation and severe toxicity."
    },
    "row5": {
      "col1": "Correct. Digoxin slows conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node by increasing vagal tone and prolonging the refractory period. In toxicity, this effect is exaggerated and can manifest as a first-degree AV block (PR interval > 0.20 seconds) or progress to more severe heart blocks. The client's PR interval of 0.24 seconds is a sign of toxic effect on the heart's conduction system, indicating impaired AV nodal conduction.",
      "col2": "Incorrect. AV block is a cardiac conduction abnormality and not a direct indicator of renal function, although it can be caused by the digoxin toxicity that resulted from renal impairment.",
      "col3": "Correct. Evidence of cardiotoxicity on the ECG, such as a new or worsening AV block, is an absolute contraindication to administering the next dose of digoxin. The nurse must withhold the dose to prevent progression to a life-threatening complete heart block and potential asystole."
