This triad, combined with the precipitous drop in level of consciousness (GCS from 15 to 10), indicates a critical increase in intracranial pressure (IICP) and impending brainstem herniation, a life-threatening emergency. The nurse's highest priorities are to prevent further harm and activate emergency assistance. Withholding the morphine is a critical 'STOP' action. Morphine, an opioid, causes respiratory depression, which would increase PaCO2 levels. Hypercapnia leads to cerebral vasodilation, further increasing intracranial volume and pressure, which could be fatal. It would also mask any further neurological decline. The second critical action is to immediately notify the provider and activate the rapid response team to facilitate urgent medical and surgical interventions (e.g., osmotic diuretics, hypertonic saline, intubation, possible craniotomy).",
        "incorrect": "Administering morphine would be catastrophic. Increasing the IV fluid rate without a specific order is inappropriate and would not address the root cause. While elevating the head of the bed is a correct intervention for IICP, it is not the most immediate priority over stopping a harmful medication and calling for help. Simply reassessing delays life-saving interventions when a clear emergency is present.",
