    "opt_1": {
      "justification": "Correct. The client's presentation at 1115 (military time) indicates a neurological emergency. The increasing systolic blood pressure, decreasing heart rate, and irregular respirations (Cushing's triad) suggest elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Anisocoria (unequal pupils), headache, and altered mental status further support this. The abrasion suggests a possible fall. Hemodialysis requires anticoagulation (heparin) and can cause rapid fluid shifts, both of which are contraindicated in the presence of a potential intracranial bleed. Withholding transport is crucial to prevent further harm. Clinical Pearl: Never proceed with elective procedures when a client exhibits new neurological deficits until a thorough evaluation is completed.",
      "scoring": "correct"
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "justification": "Incorrect. Administering heparin would be extremely dangerous. Heparin is an anticoagulant used during hemodialysis to prevent clotting within the dialysis circuit. However, in a client with suspected intracranial hemorrhage, heparin administration could exacerbate the bleeding, leading to rapid neurological deterioration, brain herniation, and potentially death. The priority is to prevent further bleeding, not to facilitate dialysis. Clinical Pearl: Anticoagulants are absolutely contraindicated in the presence of active bleeding or suspected intracranial hemorrhage.",
      "scoring": "incorrect"
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "justification": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a supine position with the head of the bed flat would increase ICP. A flat position increases venous pressure in the brain, reducing cerebral perfusion and potentially worsening the client's neurological status. The recommended position for a client with suspected increased ICP is to elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage and reduce ICP. Clinical Pearl: Elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees in clients with suspected or confirmed increased ICP unless contraindicated.",
      "scoring": "incorrect"
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "justification": "Correct. The client's change in condition warrants immediate notification of both the nephrologist (who ordered the dialysis) and the primary medical provider. The constellation of symptoms (worsening headache, altered mental status, anisocoria, Cushing's triad) points to a serious neurological event. Prompt communication ensures timely intervention, such as expediting the head CT scan and obtaining a neurosurgical consultation. Clinical Pearl: Any sudden change in neurological status requires immediate notification of the healthcare provider. SBAR communication is essential.",
      "scoring": "correct"
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "justification": "Correct. The client's altered mental status and signs of increasing ICP place them at high risk for seizures. Seizures can further increase ICP and cause neurological damage. Initiating seizure precautions, such as padding the side rails, ensuring suction and oxygen are readily available, and closely monitoring the client, is a proactive measure to protect the client from injury. Clinical Pearl: Altered mental status and neurological changes increase the risk of seizures. Implement seizure precautions to ensure client safety.",
      "scoring": "correct"
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "justification": "Incorrect. Requesting a slower ultrafiltration rate does not address the underlying problem. The primary concern is the potential for intracranial hemorrhage, which is a contraindication to hemodialysis regardless of the ultrafiltration rate. The heparin required for dialysis poses a significant risk. Addressing the neurological emergency takes precedence over the scheduled dialysis. Clinical Pearl: Prioritize addressing life-threatening conditions before routine procedures.",
