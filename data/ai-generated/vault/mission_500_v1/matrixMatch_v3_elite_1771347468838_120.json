The inflamed epiglottis can suddenly obstruct the airway. The nurse's priority is to recognize this and implement actions that maintain airway patency while avoiding any action that could precipitate laryngospasm and complete obstruction. Essential actions focus on preparing for a definitive airway and minimizing the child's distress. Contraindicated actions are those that risk stimulating the posterior pharynx or compromising the airway through positioning. Actions that are important but not immediately life-saving, such as administering antibiotics, can be delayed until the airway is stabilized.",
