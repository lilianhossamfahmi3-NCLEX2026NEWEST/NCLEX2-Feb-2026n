      "rationale": "Correct. The patient's symptom onset was at 1000, and the current time is 1200, indicating that the symptoms began within the 3-4.5 hour window for Alteplase administration. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. The earlier tPA is administered in an ischemic stroke, the greater the chance of dissolving the clot and restoring blood flow to the penumbral region (the area of potentially salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct). After 4.5 hours, the risk of hemorrhage outweighs the benefit.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always confirm the exact time of symptom onset. If the patient is unable to communicate, rely on family or witnesses. Document the source of the information clearly.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 68-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms starting at 1000.\n*   **Background:** Arrived via EMS at 1200 with left-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. NIHSS 12. History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n*   **Assessment:** Symptoms within tPA window. No hemorrhage on CT.\n*   **Recommendation:** Proceed with tPA administration per protocol, as time of onset is within the acceptable window."

      "rationale": "Correct. The non-contrast head CT shows no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. This is a critical inclusion criterion for tPA administration.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent, meaning it dissolves blood clots. If a patient has a hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain), administering Alteplase would worsen the bleeding and could lead to severe neurological damage or death. A non-contrast CT scan is essential to rule out hemorrhage before administering Alteplase.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Never administer Alteplase without first confirming the absence of hemorrhage on a CT scan. A 'negative' CT for hemorrhage is a critical safety check.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 68-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms.\n*   **Background:** Non-contrast head CT performed.\n*   **Assessment:** CT shows no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\n*   **Recommendation:** Proceed with tPA administration, as absence of hemorrhage is confirmed."

      "rationale": "Correct. The most recent blood pressure reading is 189/106 mmHg. This is above the recommended threshold of <185/110 mmHg for tPA administration.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion after tPA administration. When a blood clot is dissolved, the previously ischemic tissue is reperfused. If the blood pressure is too high, the fragile blood vessels in the damaged area are more likely to rupture, leading to bleeding in the brain.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Blood pressure must be carefully controlled before, during, and after tPA administration. Use antihypertensive medications as ordered to maintain the target blood pressure.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 68-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms.\n*   **Background:** Blood pressure is 189/106 mmHg.\n*   **Assessment:** Blood pressure is elevated above the tPA administration threshold.\n*   **Recommendation:** Administer Labetalol 10 mg IV push as ordered to lower blood pressure below 185/110 mmHg before initiating tPA."

      "rationale": "Correct. The patient's report of a 'needle in the back' yesterday indicates a recent lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture within the past 24 hours is a contraindication to tPA administration.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** A lumbar puncture creates a small hole in the dura mater, the membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Administering tPA after a lumbar puncture increases the risk of bleeding into the spinal canal or brain, leading to spinal hematoma or intracranial hemorrhage. The risk is highest within the first 24 hours after the procedure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always ask about recent procedures, including lumbar punctures, before administering tPA. If a lumbar puncture has been performed within the past 24 hours, withhold tPA and notify the provider immediately.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 68-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms.\n*   **Background:** Patient reports having a lumbar puncture yesterday.\n*   **Assessment:** Recent lumbar puncture is a contraindication to tPA administration.\n*   **Recommendation:** Withhold tPA and notify the provider immediately due to the recent lumbar puncture."

      "rationale": "Correct. The INR is 1.2, which is within the acceptable range (≤1.7) for tPA administration.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** The INR (International Normalized Ratio) measures the blood's clotting ability. An elevated INR indicates that the blood is taking longer to clot, which increases the risk of bleeding. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent, and administering it to a patient with an already prolonged INR significantly increases the risk of hemorrhage.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always check the INR before administering tPA. If the INR is above 1.7, withhold tPA and notify the provider.\n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 68-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms.\n*   **Background:** INR is 1.2.\n*   **Assessment:** INR is within the acceptable range for tPA administration.\n*   **Recommendation:** Proceed with tPA administration, as INR is within the acceptable range."
