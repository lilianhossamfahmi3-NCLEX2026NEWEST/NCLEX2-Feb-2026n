Client presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. Neighbor reports the client's symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago. Neighbor also states the client had a 'minor stumble and fall' 2 days ago but seemed 'fine' afterwards and refused medical attention. Client is alert, follows commands with her left side, but has significant expressive aphasia and dense right hemiparesis. Stroke team has evaluated the client. NIHSS score is 14."

The client's platelet count is 85,000/mm³, which is below the absolute contraindication of 100,000/mm³ for Alteplase. Alteplase, a thrombolytic, dissolves clots by activating plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades fibrin. Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, and administering Alteplase could cause life-threatening hemorrhage, especially given the recent fall. The nurse must recognize this critical safety issue. Clinical Pearl: Always check contraindications before administering Alteplase.",
