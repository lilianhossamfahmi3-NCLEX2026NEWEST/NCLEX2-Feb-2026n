Client presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. Neighbor reports the client's symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago. Neighbor also states the client had a 'minor stumble and fall' 2 days ago but seemed 'fine' afterwards and refused medical attention. Client is alert, follows commands with her left side, but has significant expressive aphasia and dense right hemiparesis. Stroke team has evaluated the client. NIHSS score is 14."
