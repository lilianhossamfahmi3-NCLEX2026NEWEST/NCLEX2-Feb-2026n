The client has a confirmed massive pulmonary embolism with signs of obstructive shock (hypotension, tachycardia, RV strain on CT, elevated troponin). While heparin is the standard treatment, the non-contrast Head CT reveals a subdural hematoma with a midline shift. This finding of an active intracranial bleed is an absolute contraindication to systemic anticoagulation. Initiating the heparin infusion would likely cause the hematoma to expand, leading to increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and death. The nurse's primary responsibility and independent 'safety stop' action is to withhold the medication and immediately notify the provider of the critical finding that contraindicates the order.",
