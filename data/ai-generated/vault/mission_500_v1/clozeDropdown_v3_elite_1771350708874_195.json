This has resulted in severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia (7.4 mEq/L). This critical electrolyte imbalance is directly causing the dangerous cardiac membrane instability seen on the ECG: peaked T-waves and a widened QRS complex. These are pre-arrest findings. The absolute priority is to recognize this imminent threat, immediately STOP the administration of a contraindicated medication (potassium chloride), and escalate care by activating the Rapid Response Team (RRT) or calling the provider for emergency orders (e.g., IV calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose). Withholding the potassium infusion is a critical safety stop to prevent causing a fatal arrhythmia.",

Administering furosemide is not the priority, as it will not work quickly enough to correct the cardiotoxicity and may be ineffective in severe AKI. Increasing oxygen is appropriate for the hypoxia but fails to address the primary electrical threat to the client's life. The nurse must first intervene on the issue that will cause death most rapidly.",
