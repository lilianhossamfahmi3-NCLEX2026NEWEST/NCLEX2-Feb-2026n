The client is experiencing life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 7.1) with ECG changes, AND concurrent digoxin toxicity (level 3.2) with classic signs (bradycardia, visual changes, GI upset, AV block). The 'Safety Stop' is recognizing that administering calcium gluconate in the presence of digoxin toxicity is contraindicated and can precipitate a fatal dysrhythmia ('stone heart') due to the synergistic effects of calcium and digitalis on myocardial contractility and conduction. Therefore, the nurse's first action is to ensure continuous monitoring. The next actions are to withhold the dangerous medication (calcium) and the medication causing the toxicity (digoxin). Then, the nurse must urgently communicate the full clinical picture to the provider and advocate for the antidote. Finally, the nurse can proceed with the safe component of the hyperkalemia protocol (insulin/dextrose) which will begin to lower the potassium level.",

Any sequence that delays placing the client on a cardiac monitor fails to address the most immediate life-threat.

Delaying communication with the provider after identifying a life-threatening contraindication is also unsafe.",
