    "correct": "The combination of neurological changes (increasing agitation), respiratory distress (shortness of breath, SpO2 91%), and a petechial rash (fine, non-blanching rash) strongly suggests Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES). FES occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the circulation after a fracture, leading to capillary blockage and inflammation, especially in the lungs and brain. The client's thrombocytopenia (platelet count 120,000/mm³) further increases the risk of bleeding. Enoxaparin, an anticoagulant, is contraindicated in this situation due to the increased bleeding risk associated with FES and thrombocytopenia. Administering enoxaparin could exacerbate internal bleeding and worsen the client's condition. The nurse's priority is to withhold the enoxaparin, administer oxygen to address the hypoxemia, elevate the head of the bed to high-Fowler's position to improve ventilation, and immediately notify the provider and Rapid Response Team for further evaluation and management.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings, while important, do not represent the immediate life-threatening risk posed by potential FES. Pain is expected with a femur fracture. The client's anxiety about belongings, while important to address, is secondary to the physiological instability. Properly hanging traction weights are a routine assessment and do not indicate acute deterioration. Focusing on these aspects distracts from the critical signs of FES.",

Consider obtaining an arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess oxygenation and ventilation."
