The vital signs trend confirms decompensation with worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is also a criterion for FES and creates a significant bleeding risk. Administering an anticoagulant like enoxaparin is contraindicated and extremely dangerous in this situation. The nurse's priority is to withhold the medication, apply oxygen, place the client in a high-Fowler's position, and notify the Rapid Response Team and provider immediately.",
