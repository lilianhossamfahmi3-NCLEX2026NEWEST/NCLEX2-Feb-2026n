The cardinal sign is pain out of proportion to the injury, unrelieved by opioids, and exacerbated by passive stretch. This is ischemic pain, not nociceptive pain. The nurse's notes confirm this, along with paresthesia and coolness (the 6 Ps). Tachycardia and hypertension reflect severe pain and systemic stress. The lab results are critical: markedly elevated CK confirms muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and the resulting release of intracellular potassium (hyperkalemia) and myoglobin is causing acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine). The 'Safety Stop' is recognizing that administering more morphine is dangerous; it will not treat the underlying ischemia and will mask further neurovascular deterioration, delaying limb-saving intervention. The priority independent nursing actions are to withhold the dangerous intervention (morphine) and immediately notify the provider to prepare for emergent cast removal and fasciotomy.",
        "incorrect": "The distractors represent other potential but less likely complications. Uncontrolled pain is incorrect because the pain has specific characteristics (ischemic) and is accompanied by objective neurovascular and systemic findings. Fat Embolism would present with respiratory distress and petechiae. DVT would cause swelling and pain but not the acute, severe neurovascular compromise. Hypovolemic shock would present with hypotension, not the hypertension seen here. The incorrect actions are all unsafe: elevating the limb above the heart can worsen ischemia, anxiolytics mask CNS changes, and encouraging oral fluids is insufficient for the impending AKI which requires IV fluid resuscitation.",
