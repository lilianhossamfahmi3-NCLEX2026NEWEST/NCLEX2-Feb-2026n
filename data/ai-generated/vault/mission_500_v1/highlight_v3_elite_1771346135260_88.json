The combination of elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), epigastric pain (indicating liver distension), and severe thrombocytopenia (Platelets 42,000/mm³) confirms the diagnosis of HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) syndrome, a severe variant of preeclampsia. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits platelet aggregation. Administering Ketorolac to a client with severe thrombocytopenia is absolutely contraindicated as it can precipitate catastrophic hemorrhage, such as a ruptured subcapsular liver hematoma or intracranial bleeding. This constitutes a 'SAFETY STOP' situation where the nurse's independent action to withhold the medication is critical to prevent patient harm.",

For example, the severe hypertension is the indication for Labetalol, and the neurological symptoms (headache, hyperreflexia) are the indication for Magnesium Sulfate. While these findings are critical, they do not create the specific contraindication for the scheduled Ketorolac administration.
