        "correct": "The nurse must synthesize data from multiple sources to prevent a life-threatening medication error. The combination of elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), epigastric pain (indicating liver distension), and severe thrombocytopenia (Platelets 42,000/mm³) confirms the diagnosis of HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) syndrome, a severe variant of preeclampsia. In HELLP syndrome, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs, leading to the destruction of red blood cells and subsequent elevation of liver enzymes due to hepatic inflammation and necrosis. Thrombocytopenia results from platelet consumption and sequestration in the liver. The epigastric pain is caused by distension of the liver capsule due to swelling and potential hemorrhage. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby reducing the production of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator. Administering Ketorolac to a client with severe thrombocytopenia is absolutely contraindicated as it can precipitate catastrophic hemorrhage, such as a ruptured subcapsular liver hematoma or intracranial bleeding. This constitutes a 'SAFETY STOP' situation where the nurse's independent action to withhold the medication is critical to prevent patient harm.",
        "incorrect": "Highlighting other data points is incorrect because they either represent expected findings or are indications for appropriate, ordered treatments. For example, the severe hypertension is the indication for Labetalol, and the neurological symptoms (headache, hyperreflexia) are the indication for Magnesium Sulfate. While these findings are critical, they do not create the specific contraindication for the scheduled Ketorolac administration. The core safety risk lies in the combination of dangerously low platelets and the order for a medication that further impairs clotting.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "justification": "This symptom is a cardinal sign of liver involvement in HELLP syndrome, suggesting stretching and inflammation of Glisson's capsule. The pain arises from the distension of the liver capsule due to edema and potential hemorrhage. This distension increases the risk of a subcapsular hematoma and subsequent life-threatening rupture, a risk that would be catastrophically amplified by an antiplatelet medication like Ketorolac. Clinical Pearl: Always assess for RUQ or epigastric pain in preeclamptic patients as it can indicate impending liver rupture."

            "justification": "While this finding indicates severe hypertension and is life-threatening in itself, it is the primary *indication* for the ordered antihypertensive (Labetalol). Labetalol is a beta-adrenergic blocker that reduces blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. It does not represent a contraindication for any of the scheduled medications. Clinical Pearl: Rapidly lowering blood pressure in severe preeclampsia is crucial to prevent stroke and other end-organ damage."

            "justification": "The elevated creatinine indicates renal insufficiency, a common complication of severe preeclampsia. In preeclampsia, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction reduce renal blood flow, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased creatinine levels. While Ketorolac should be used with caution in renal impairment, the immediate, life-threatening contraindication is the severe thrombocytopenia, not the mild elevation in creatinine. Clinical Pearl: Monitor renal function closely in preeclamptic patients, as acute kidney injury can develop rapidly."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "justification": "The highly elevated AST is a key diagnostic criterion for HELLP syndrome, confirming liver injury. In HELLP, liver damage results from microthrombi formation in the hepatic sinusoids, leading to hepatocellular necrosis and elevated liver enzymes. It supports the overall clinical picture of severe disease but is not the direct contraindication for Ketorolac; the low platelet count is the critical factor related to bleeding risk. Clinical Pearl: Elevated liver enzymes in preeclampsia warrant immediate investigation for HELLP syndrome."

            "justification": "This is the most critical piece of data. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/mm³) is a life-threatening condition that creates an absolute contraindication for NSAIDs like Ketorolac, which impair platelet function and would drastically increase the risk of spontaneous and uncontrolled bleeding. The thrombocytopenia in HELLP syndrome is caused by increased platelet activation and consumption, leading to their sequestration in the liver and spleen. Clinical Pearl: Always check platelet counts before administering any medication that affects platelet function in preeclamptic patients."

            "justification": "This is the correct, priority, evidence-based treatment for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Magnesium sulfate acts as a central nervous system depressant, reducing neuronal excitability and preventing seizures. It is essential to continue this medication; withholding it would place the client at high risk for eclampsia. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., decreased respiratory rate, absent reflexes) during magnesium sulfate infusion."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "justification": "This is the specific order that must be withheld. The nurse must recognize the drug class (NSAID) and its antiplatelet mechanism of action, connecting it to the absolute contraindication presented by the client's severe thrombocytopenia. Administering this medication would be a serious error. Ketorolac inhibits platelet aggregation, increasing the risk of bleeding in a patient who already has a severely compromised clotting ability. Clinical Pearl: NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia due to the increased risk of bleeding."
