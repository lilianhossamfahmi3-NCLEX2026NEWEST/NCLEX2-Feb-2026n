        "rationale": "Correct. The client is most likely experiencing a tension pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This compresses the lung, shifts mediastinal structures (trachea, heart, great vessels), and impairs venous return, resulting in obstructive shock. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are: sudden onset of hypotension and tachycardia (obstructive shock), severe hypoxia, absent breath sounds on the affected side (right), asymmetrical chest movement, high peak pressure alarms, tracheal deviation away from the affected side (left), and hyperlucency on the affected side on CXR. The ABG shows severe respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, consistent with impaired gas exchange due to lung compression. ClinicalPearl: A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention. Recognize the signs early to prevent cardiovascular collapse."

        "optionId": "pc2",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause obstructive shock and hypoxia, it does not explain the unilateral absent breath sounds, asymmetrical chest rise, or the specific CXR findings of mediastinal shift and a hyperlucent lung field. A PE would typically present with sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia, but without the localized physical exam and radiographic findings of a pneumothorax. ClinicalPearl: Consider PE in patients with sudden dyspnea and chest pain, but rule out other causes based on physical exam and imaging."

        "optionId": "pc3",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. A mucous plug would cause high pressure alarms and hypoxia, but it typically leads to atelectasis (lung collapse), which would appear as opacification on CXR and would pull the trachea toward the affected side, not push it away. Breath sounds would be diminished or absent, but the mediastinal shift would be toward the affected side. ClinicalPearl: Mucous plugs are common in intubated patients. Prevention includes adequate hydration, humidification, and frequent suctioning."

        "optionId": "pc4",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Cardiogenic shock would present with hypotension but typically involves bilateral crackles (pulmonary edema) due to fluid backing up into the lungs. It would not have unilateral findings like absent breath sounds or tracheal deviation. Cardiogenic shock is caused by the heart's inability to pump effectively, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. ClinicalPearl: Cardiogenic shock often presents with elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure and requires interventions to improve cardiac contractility and reduce afterload."

While a ventilator malfunction is a possibility, the physical assessment findings (tracheal deviation, unilateral absent breath sounds) are client-specific and point to a physiological catastrophe, not an equipment failure. The first step in ruling out ventilator malfunction would be to disconnect the client and manually ventilate, which is an appropriate action but the underlying condition is the pneumothorax. ClinicalPearl: Always assess the patient first, then the equipment. If the patient's condition deteriorates suddenly, consider a physiological cause before assuming equipment failure."

        "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is life-threatening and represents a 'SAFETY STOP' failure. A tension pneumothorax is caused by air trapping in the pleural space, which increases intrathoracic pressure. Increasing PEEP will force more air into that space, worsening the tension, compressing the heart and great vessels further, and accelerating cardiovascular collapse. PEEP increases alveolar pressure, which can exacerbate air leak in the setting of pneumothorax. ClinicalPearl: Never increase PEEP in a patient with suspected or confirmed pneumothorax without addressing the air leak first. This can lead to rapid deterioration and death. SAFETY STOP! Increasing PEEP in this situation will worsen the tension pneumothorax and cause further hemodynamic instability.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, the cause is obstructive shock, not hypovolemia. A fluid bolus will not correct the underlying mechanical compression of the heart and may delay the life-saving decompression. The primary problem is a pressure problem, not a volume problem. Giving fluids may worsen pulmonary edema if the underlying cause is not addressed. ClinicalPearl: In obstructive shock, addressing the obstruction is paramount. Fluid resuscitation alone is unlikely to improve the patient's condition and may be harmful.",

        "rationale": "Correct. This is a critical, life-saving intervention. The nurse must anticipate and prepare for emergency needle decompression or chest tube insertion to relieve the pressure in the pleural space, allow the lung to re-expand, and resolve the obstructive shock. Needle decompression involves inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to release the trapped air. ClinicalPearl: Needle decompression is a temporizing measure. A chest tube is usually required for definitive management of a pneumothorax.",

Manually ventilating with a bag-valve mask allows the nurse to assess lung compliance by feel and provide 100% oxygen while preparing for definitive intervention (decompression). This also allows for delivery of 100% FiO2. ClinicalPearl: Manual ventilation allows for better control of airway pressure and oxygenation while preparing for definitive treatment. Assess lung compliance during manual ventilation to monitor for changes in resistance.",

Obtaining an ECG would delay the immediate, life-saving interventions required for a tension pneumothorax. An ECG may show sinus tachycardia or other arrhythmias secondary to hypoxia and stress, but it will not address the underlying cause. ClinicalPearl: Focus on addressing the immediate life-threatening problem first. An ECG can be obtained after the patient is stabilized.",

Changes in urine output occur over a longer timeframe (30-60 minutes). While decreased urine output may indicate poor perfusion, it is not the priority in this acute situation.
