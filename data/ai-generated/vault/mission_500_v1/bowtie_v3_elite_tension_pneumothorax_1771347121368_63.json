While a ventilator malfunction is a possibility, the physical assessment findings (tracheal deviation, unilateral absent breath sounds) are client-specific and point to a physiological catastrophe, not an equipment failure. The first step in ruling out ventilator malfunction would be to disconnect the client and manually ventilate, which is an appropriate action but the underlying condition is the pneumothorax."

A tension pneumothorax is caused by air trapping in the pleural space, which increases intrathoracic pressure. Increasing PEEP will force more air into that space, worsening the tension, compressing the heart and great vessels further, and accelerating cardiovascular collapse."

A fluid bolus will not correct the underlying mechanical compression of the heart and may delay the life-saving decompression. The primary problem is a pressure problem, not a volume problem."
