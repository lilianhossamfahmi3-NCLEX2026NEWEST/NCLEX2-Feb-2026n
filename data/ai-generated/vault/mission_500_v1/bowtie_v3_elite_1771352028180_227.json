    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 48-year-old male client with a history of schizophrenia on an inpatient psychiatric unit. The client was readmitted 3 days ago for medication stabilization after a period of non-adherence and lives in a supported living facility. The nurse completes an assessment and reviews the client's electronic health record. Based on the provided information, complete the bowtie by selecting the most likely potential condition, two actions the nurse should take, and two parameters the nurse should monitor.",

Client is diaphoretic, and his clothes are damp with sweat, although the room thermostat is set to 20° C (68° F). Mumbling incoherently. \n\n1500: Client is now minimally responsive to verbal stimuli. Severe, generalized muscle rigidity noted ('lead-pipe' rigidity). Tremor noted in upper extremities.

    "correct": "The client's presentation of hyperthermia (40.1° C/104.2° F), extreme 'lead-pipe' muscle rigidity, autonomic instability (labile BP, tachycardia), and altered mental status, combined with laboratory findings of markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK), leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury, are hallmark signs of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). This is a life-threatening emergency precipitated by antipsychotic medication, in this case, haloperidol. Pathophysiologically, NMS results from dopamine blockade in the basal ganglia and hypothalamus, leading to muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. The nurse's priority 'SAFETY STOP' action is to withhold the next dose of the offending agent, haloperidol (A1), to prevent worsening the syndrome. The second priority is to initiate immediate cooling measures (A4) to combat the life-threatening hyperthermia, which drives much of the pathophysiology by causing cellular damage and organ dysfunction. Monitoring must focus on the most severe complications: cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia and autonomic dysfunction (requiring continuous cardiac monitoring - PM2) and progressive renal failure from rhabdomyolysis (monitored by urine output and color - PM5).",
    "incorrect": "Selecting other conditions misses the specific constellation of symptoms pointing to NMS. Sepsis would not typically cause such extreme rigidity or CK elevation without a clear infectious source. Serotonin Syndrome presents with hyperreflexia and clonus, not lead-pipe rigidity. Administering benztropine (A2) is a critical error, as its anticholinergic properties can impair heat dissipation and worsen the hyperthermia. Administering lorazepam (A5) or using seclusion (A3) addresses symptoms (agitation) without treating the underlying catastrophic medical process and could delay life-saving interventions. Monitoring less critical parameters like pupillary response (PM1) or blood glucose (PM3) diverts attention from the immediate threats of cardiac arrest and renal failure. Level of agitation (PM4) is subjective and less critical than objective physiological parameters.",

        "label": "PC1",
        "content": "Sepsis",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. While sepsis causes fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, the profound muscle rigidity and extremely high creatine kinase (CK) levels are not typical. This presentation is more specific to NMS."

        "label": "PC2",
        "content": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The client exhibits all classic tetrad symptoms: high fever (hyperthermia), severe muscle rigidity, autonomic instability (labile BP, tachycardia), and altered mental status, following the initiation of an antipsychotic. The supporting labs (high CK, WBC, K+) confirm this diagnosis."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Serotonin Syndrome is characterized by hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and tremor, rather than the severe 'lead-pipe' rigidity seen in NMS. It is also caused by serotonergic agents, and haloperidol is primarily a dopamine antagonist."

        "content": "Acute Dystonic Reaction",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. An acute dystonic reaction is an extrapyramidal side effect involving acute, painful muscle spasms, typically of the neck, face, and back. It does not cause hyperthermia, autonomic instability, or systemic breakdown."

        "explanation": "Incorrect. This is a dangerous action. Benztropine is used for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) but is ineffective for NMS rigidity. Its anticholinergic properties can worsen NMS by impairing sweating and heat dissipation, exacerbating the lethal hyperthermia."
