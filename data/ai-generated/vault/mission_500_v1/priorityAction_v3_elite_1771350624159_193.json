        "correct": "The synthesis of the available data indicates the client is developing cardiogenic shock. Key cues include the significant drop in blood pressure to 84/50 mmHg, worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, and desaturation. The elevated serum lactate (4.1 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (BUN 32, Cr 1.9) confirm end-organ hypoperfusion. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, has negative inotropic and chronotropic effects and causes vasodilation, which would catastrophically worsen the client's hypotension and cardiac output. The nurse's priority is to recognize this life-threatening contraindication, withhold the medication (a 'Don't Proceed' or 'Safety Stop' action), and immediately notify the provider to advocate for a change in the plan of care, which will likely involve synchronized cardioversion or vasopressor support.",
