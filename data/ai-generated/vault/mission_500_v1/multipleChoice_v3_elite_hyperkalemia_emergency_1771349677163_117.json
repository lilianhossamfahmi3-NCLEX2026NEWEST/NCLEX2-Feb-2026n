He was brought in by family due to progressive, profound weakness and nausea over the past 48 hours. The client reports missing his last two scheduled hemodialysis appointments, stating, 'I felt too weak to go, and my ride fell through.' The client is becoming increasingly lethargic and difficult to arouse."

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that causes a transient efflux of potassium from cells, acutely increasing serum potassium by 0.5-1.0 mEq/L. In a client with severe hyperkalemia (8.8 mEq/L) and profound ECG changes (sine wave pattern), this iatrogenic increase in potassium can directly precipitate irreversible ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. This is a critical safety stop. The nurse must question this order and advocate for a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (e.g., rocuronium) for intubation.",
