      "column": "Appropriate Action",
      "rationale": "**Appropriate Action.** The client exhibits severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L), likely contributing to ventricular fibrillation. Calcium chloride administration is crucial to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane by increasing the threshold potential, counteracting the effects of hyperkalemia. This allows for improved cardiac electrical activity and responsiveness to defibrillation. In hyperkalemia, elevated extracellular potassium reduces the resting membrane potential, making cells more excitable initially, but prolonged elevation leads to depolarization and inexcitability. Calcium administration helps restore the normal gradient.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Calcium chloride is preferred over calcium gluconate in cardiac arrest due to its higher calcium concentration and faster onset of action. Monitor the client for bradycardia during administration. Ensure adequate IV access to prevent extravasation, which can cause tissue necrosis."
    },
    "row_2": {
      "column": "Inappropriate Action",
      "rationale": "**Inappropriate Action.** The client has a documented allergy to procainamide. Administering procainamide would likely cause an anaphylactic reaction, further compromising the client's condition during a critical resuscitation. Anaphylaxis causes vasodilation, bronchospasm, and increased capillary permeability, leading to hypotension, respiratory distress, and potentially death. The body's immune system releases histamine and other mediators, causing systemic effects.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Always verify medication allergies before administration, especially during a code. Utilize the 'two-patient identifier' rule. In this case, consider alternative antiarrhythmics like amiodarone or lidocaine, if indicated, after addressing the hyperkalemia."
    },
    "row_3": {
      "column": "Inappropriate Action",
      "rationale": "**Inappropriate Action.** Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic, disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, preventing effective cardiac output. Defibrillation delivers an electrical shock to depolarize the entire myocardium simultaneously, allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to regain control and restore a coordinated rhythm. Delaying defibrillation decreases the chance of successful conversion to a perfusing rhythm and reduces survival rates. Each minute of untreated VF decreases survival by approximately 10%.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Continue chest compressions while the defibrillator is charging. Minimize interruptions in chest compressions before and after defibrillation. Ensure proper pad placement (right infraclavicular and left mid-axillary line) for optimal current flow through the heart."
    },
    "row_4": {
      "column": "Appropriate Action",
      "rationale": "**Appropriate Action.** The client's CKD and elevated lactate (4.1 mmol/L) suggest metabolic acidosis, which can exacerbate hyperkalemia and impair cardiac function. Sodium bicarbonate helps buffer excess hydrogen ions, increasing the pH and temporarily shifting potassium intracellularly. This reduces the extracellular potassium concentration and improves the responsiveness of the myocardium to other interventions. Acidosis impairs myocardial contractility and reduces the effectiveness of catecholamines.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Administer sodium bicarbonate cautiously, as rapid correction of acidosis can lead to 'overshoot' alkalosis. Monitor arterial blood gases to guide further bicarbonate administration. Ensure adequate ventilation to eliminate carbon dioxide produced by bicarbonate buffering."

    "row_5": {
      "column": "Unrelated Action",
      "rationale": "**Unrelated Action.** Nasogastric (NG) tube placement is not indicated during cardiac arrest. The priority is to restore cardiac rhythm and perfusion. NG tube placement would interrupt CPR and divert resources from essential interventions. While gastric distention can occur during bag-valve-mask ventilation, it is not the immediate priority during resuscitation.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Address airway management with intubation and ventilation. Focus on interventions that directly improve cardiac rhythm and perfusion. Consider NG tube placement after the client is stabilized, if needed, to decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration."

    "row_6": {
      "column": "Appropriate Action",
      "rationale": "**Appropriate Action.** Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic medication used in ACLS for shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation. It prolongs the action potential duration and refractoriness of myocardial tissue, helping to suppress the chaotic electrical activity causing VF. Amiodarone also has sodium channel blocking effects, further stabilizing the myocardium. It is indicated after initial defibrillation attempts and epinephrine administration have failed to convert the rhythm.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Administer amiodarone as a rapid IV push. Be prepared for potential side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia. Follow with a continuous infusion of amiodarone after ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) to prevent recurrence of arrhythmias. Monitor the client's QT interval."
