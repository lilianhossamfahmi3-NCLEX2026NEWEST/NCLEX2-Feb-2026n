Client reports being non-adherent with his prescribed medications (lisinopril, furosemide, sevelamer) for 'at least a week' because he 'couldn't get refills.' He appears fatigued but is alert and oriented x3. Skin is cool and pale with 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Denies chest pain at this time.
