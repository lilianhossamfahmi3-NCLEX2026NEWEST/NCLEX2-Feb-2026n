    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition characterized by the progressive accumulation of air within the pleural space, leading to compression of the mediastinum and impaired venous return to the heart. The initial pneumothorax, evidenced by the chest x-ray, has likely progressed due to the fractured ribs acting as a one-way valve, allowing air to enter the pleural space with each inspiration but preventing its escape. This increased pressure causes the trachea to deviate away from the affected side (right to left), compresses the great vessels, and leads to jugular venous distention (JVD) due to impaired venous return. The resulting decrease in cardiac output manifests as hypotension (86/52) and tachycardia (148). The shallow, rapid respirations (38) and decreasing SpO2 (84%) reflect the compromised lung function and impaired gas exchange. The priority is to address the tension pneumothorax immediately to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death. Activating the RRT brings necessary expertise and resources to the bedside. Preparing for needle decompression allows for rapid relief of the pressure within the chest cavity. Applying a non-rebreather mask maximizes oxygen delivery to compensate for impaired gas exchange. Placing the client in high-Fowler's position can aid in lung expansion. Questioning the morphine order is crucial due to the risk of further respiratory depression and hypotension. Positive pressure ventilation would exacerbate the tension pneumothorax.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "The client's condition is rapidly deteriorating, indicating a life-threatening emergency. Activating the RRT immediately brings a team of experienced healthcare professionals to the bedside, ensuring timely intervention and access to advanced resources. This is the highest priority to optimize patient outcomes."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "Needle decompression is the definitive treatment for a tension pneumothorax. By inserting a large-bore needle into the pleural space, the trapped air is released, relieving pressure on the mediastinum and restoring venous return. Preparing the necessary equipment (e.g., 14-gauge angiocatheter, antiseptic solution) ensures that the procedure can be performed without delay."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "justification": "The client's SpO2 of 84% indicates severe hypoxemia. Applying a non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min delivers the highest possible concentration of oxygen, maximizing oxygen delivery to the tissues and mitigating the effects of impaired gas exchange. This is a critical intervention to support oxygenation while addressing the underlying cause of the respiratory distress."

        "justification": "Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position can help to improve lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm. This can ease the work of breathing and improve ventilation, providing symptomatic relief and supporting oxygenation. While helpful, it is a lower priority than interventions that directly address the tension pneumothorax and hypoxemia."

        "justification": "Morphine sulfate is a respiratory depressant and can cause hypotension. In a client with a tension pneumothorax and already compromised respiratory and cardiovascular function, administering morphine could lead to further respiratory depression, worsening hypoxemia and potentially causing respiratory arrest. The nurse has a duty to question this order and advocate for alternative pain management strategies."
