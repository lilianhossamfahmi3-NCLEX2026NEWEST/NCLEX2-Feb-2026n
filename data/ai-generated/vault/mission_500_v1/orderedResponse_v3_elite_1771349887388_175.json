This is evidenced by the classic triad of tracheal deviation away from the affected side (leftward deviation), jugular venous distention (JVD), and profound hypotension. The escalating tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia further confirm severe cardiorespiratory compromise. The priority of actions must address this immediate threat to life. The nurse must first activate the RRT to bring expert help and resources to the bedside. Simultaneously, the nurse must anticipate and prepare for the life-saving intervention: needle decompression to relieve the intrathoracic pressure. Maximizing oxygenation and positioning for comfort are next. Critically, the nurse must recognize and withhold/question two orders that would be lethal: morphine sulfate (which would cause respiratory depression and worsen hypotension) and positive pressure ventilation (which would rapidly increase the tension and cause complete cardiovascular collapse).",

Needle decompression (thoracostomy) is the emergent, life-saving procedure to convert the tension pneumothorax back to a simple pneumothorax by relieving the trapped air and pressure on the great vessels and heart. The nurse must anticipate this provider-performed intervention and have the necessary equipment (a 14-gauge angiocath and antiseptic) at the bedside to prevent any delay."

Placing the client in an upright position can facilitate diaphragmatic excursion and reduce the work of breathing, potentially providing some symptomatic relief.

While pain is present, administering an opioid is absolutely contraindicated in a client with hypotension (BP 86/52) and respiratory compromise. Morphine would cause vasodilation, worsening the shock, and would depress the respiratory drive, leading to respiratory arrest. The nurse has a duty to recognize this contraindication and withhold the medication. Similarly, the order for bag-valve-mask ventilation must be withheld as it would be fatal."
