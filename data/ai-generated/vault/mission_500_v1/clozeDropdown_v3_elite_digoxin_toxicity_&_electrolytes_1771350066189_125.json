The facility staff initially suspected a gastrointestinal virus. The client reports 'everything looks shimmery' but denies specific color changes in his vision. He mentions a telehealth appointment two weeks ago where a 'water pill' (furosemide) was added to his regimen. He states he missed his follow-up lab appointment last week due to lack of transportation from the facility."
