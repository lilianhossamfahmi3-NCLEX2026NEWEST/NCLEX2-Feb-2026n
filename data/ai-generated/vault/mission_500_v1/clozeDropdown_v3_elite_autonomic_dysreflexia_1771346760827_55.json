The client uses a wheelchair for mobility and has a chronic indwelling urinary catheter. He has a documented history of orthostatic hypotension when transferring. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) reports the client activated the call light complaining of a 'terrible, pounding headache.'\n\n**1130 RN Assessment:**\nClient is alert and oriented x3, appears anxious and distressed. Complains of a severe, throbbing headache rated 9/10. Profuse diaphoresis is noted on the face, neck, and upper chest. Skin below the T5 level is cool and pale with visible piloerection (goosebumps). Face and neck are flushed. Reports nasal stuffiness. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Bladder scanner indicates 50 mL of urine in the bladder. No kinks are visible in the urinary catheter tubing."

Key cues include the severe, pounding headache, profound hypertension (210/118 mmHg) well above baseline, bradycardia (52 bpm), diaphoresis and flushing above the level of injury (T5), and piloerection below the level of injury. This is the correct synthesis of the available data.",

            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has severe hypertension, this term is less precise. AD is the specific pathophysiological syndrome causing the hypertension in a client with an SCI. Malignant hypertension typically implies acute end-organ damage and does not account for the other specific signs like bradycardia, flushing/diaphoresis line, and piloerection.",

The current cluster of symptoms (headache, diaphoresis, bradycardia) points to AD as the cause, which must be treated immediately to prevent a stroke.",

Midodrine is an alpha-1 agonist that causes potent vasoconstriction to treat orthostatic hypotension. Administering this medication to a client with a blood pressure of 210/118 mmHg would catastrophically worsen the hypertension and significantly increase the risk of a stroke, seizure, or myocardial infarction.

Sitting the client fully upright utilizes orthostatic effects to help lower blood pressure and reduce intracranial pressure, providing some immediate relief and safety while the nurse continues to search for and eliminate the noxious stimulus (e.g., kinked catheter, bowel impaction).",

The nurse's priority is to raise the head of the bed and assess for the cause. Pharmacological intervention is a secondary step if the initial actions do not resolve the hypertension.",
