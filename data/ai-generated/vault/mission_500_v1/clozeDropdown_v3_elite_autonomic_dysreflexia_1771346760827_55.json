The client uses a wheelchair for mobility and has a chronic indwelling urinary catheter. He has a documented history of orthostatic hypotension when transferring. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) reports the client activated the call light complaining of a 'terrible, pounding headache.'\n\n**1130 RN Assessment:**\nClient is alert and oriented x3, appears anxious and distressed. Complains of a severe, throbbing headache rated 9/10. Profuse diaphoresis is noted on the face, neck, and upper chest. Skin below the T5 level is cool and pale with visible piloerection (goosebumps). Face and neck are flushed. Reports nasal stuffiness. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Bladder scanner indicates 50 mL of urine in the bladder. No kinks are visible in the urinary catheter tubing."

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "autonomic dysreflexia.": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency that can occur in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of the injury, leading to an exaggerated sympathetic response. This response causes massive vasoconstriction, resulting in severe hypertension. The body attempts to compensate through the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to bradycardia. Other manifestations include a severe, throbbing headache due to increased intracranial pressure, profuse diaphoresis and flushing above the level of the injury, and cool, pale skin with piloerection (goosebumps) below the level of the injury. Nasal stuffiness can also occur due to vasodilation in the nasal passages. The bladder scanner result of 50mL rules out acute urinary retention as the cause, but the catheter should still be assessed for patency.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "malignant hypertension.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client's blood pressure is dangerously elevated, malignant hypertension is a general term for severely elevated blood pressure with evidence of end-organ damage (e.g., kidney damage, encephalopathy). Although AD can lead to end-organ damage if left untreated, the specific constellation of symptoms (bradycardia, diaphoresis/flushing above the injury level, piloerection below the injury level) points specifically to autonomic dysreflexia as the underlying cause. Addressing the AD will, in turn, address the hypertension.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "an acute ischemic stroke.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While severe hypertension, as seen in autonomic dysreflexia, can increase the risk of stroke, the client's current symptoms are more indicative of AD itself. The headache, bradycardia, diaphoresis, flushing, and piloerection are all characteristic of AD. Furthermore, the client's history of a T5 spinal cord injury makes AD a more likely diagnosis than a primary stroke. Ruling out and treating AD is the priority to prevent complications such as stroke.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "septic shock.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is characterized by hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (elevated heart rate), fever (or hypothermia), and signs of organ dysfunction. The client's presentation of hypertension and bradycardia is inconsistent with septic shock.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "administer the scheduled 1200 midodrine.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Midodrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension by causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure. Administering midodrine to a client with a blood pressure of 210/118 mmHg would be extremely dangerous and could lead to a hypertensive crisis, stroke, or other severe complications. The medication should be held, and the provider notified of the client's elevated blood pressure.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "lower the head of the bed to a flat position.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Lowering the head of the bed would increase cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, exacerbating the client's severe headache and potentially increasing the risk of a hemorrhagic stroke. This intervention is contraindicated in a client with autonomic dysreflexia and severe hypertension.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    "raise the head of the bed to 90 degrees.": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Raising the head of the bed to a high Fowler's position (90 degrees) is the immediate priority intervention for a client experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. This position promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to lower the client's blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications such as stroke or seizure. This is a critical first step while the nurse assesses for and addresses the underlying cause of the AD.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    "apply the PRN nitroglycerin ointment.": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While nitroglycerin ointment, a vasodilator, may be considered to lower the client's blood pressure, it is not the immediate first action. The priority is to raise the head of the bed to 90 degrees to utilize gravity to lower the blood pressure. Additionally, the nurse must first assess for and attempt to remove the noxious stimulus triggering the AD. Pharmacological interventions are typically reserved for cases where non-pharmacological measures are insufficient or while the cause is being investigated.",

  "SBAR": {
    "Situation": "1130: A 45-year-old male client with a T5 spinal cord injury in long-term care is complaining of a severe, pounding headache.",
    "Background": "The client has a history of orthostatic hypotension and uses a chronic indwelling urinary catheter. Baseline BP is typically around 112/68 mmHg. He received docusate, metoprolol, and midodrine at 0900.",
    "Assessment": "The client is alert and oriented but anxious and distressed. BP is 210/118 mmHg, HR is 52 bpm, RR is 20/min, Temp is 37.0°C (98.6°F), and SpO2 is 97% on room air. He reports a 9/10 throbbing headache. Assessment reveals profuse diaphoresis above the T5 level, flushing of the face and neck, cool and pale skin with piloerection below the T5 level, and nasal stuffiness. Bladder scanner shows 50 mL urine; catheter tubing has no visible kinks.",
    "Recommendation": "The client is likely experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. I recommend immediately raising the head of the bed to 90 degrees. Hold the scheduled 1200 midodrine. I will assess for potential causes such as bowel impaction or catheter obstruction and notify the provider for further orders, potentially including a PRN antihypertensive medication."
  },
  "clinicalPearl": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt recognition and intervention. Remember the hallmark signs: severe hypertension, bradycardia, headache, flushing/diaphoresis above the level of injury, and piloerection below the level of injury. Always prioritize raising the head of the bed and searching for the noxious stimulus. Untreated AD can lead to stroke, seizure, or even death. Educate clients with SCI and their caregivers about the signs and symptoms of AD and strategies for prevention.",
