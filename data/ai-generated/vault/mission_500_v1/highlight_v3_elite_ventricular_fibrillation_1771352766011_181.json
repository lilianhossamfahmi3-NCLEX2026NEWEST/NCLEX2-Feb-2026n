  "itemRationale": "The central clinical challenge is identifying contraindications for IV metoprolol in a patient undergoing Targeted Temperature Management (TTM). The nurse must integrate data from all tabs. The patient's temperature is 33.1°C (hypothermic), heart rate is 50 bpm (bradycardic), and QTc is 515 ms. TTM induces bradycardia and prolongs the QT interval. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, has negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, which could dangerously exacerbate bradycardia, leading to severe hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or asystole. The highlighted cues, 'Skin is cool and pale due to external cooling measures' and 'Currently receiving norepinephrine,' indicate hypothermia and hemodynamic instability, contraindicating metoprolol. This is a 'SAFETY STOP' where the nurse prevents a potentially lethal error.",
