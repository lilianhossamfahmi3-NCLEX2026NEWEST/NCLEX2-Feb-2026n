    "itemRationale": "The core clinical challenge is to recognize a critical contraindication for administering IV metoprolol, a beta-blocker, to a patient undergoing Targeted Temperature Management (TTM). The nurse must synthesize data from all tabs. The patient's core temperature is 33.1°C (hypothermic), and their heart rate is 50/min (bradycardic), with a prolonged QTc of 515 ms. Therapeutic hypothermia itself induces bradycardia and prolongs the QT interval. Administering a beta-blocker, which has negative chronotropic (slows heart rate) and inotropic (reduces contractility) effects, would dangerously potentiate this bradycardia and could lead to severe hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or asystole. The highlighted cues from the note, 'Skin is cool and pale due to external cooling measures' and 'Currently receiving norepinephrine,' directly reflect the patient's hypothermic and fragile hemodynamic state, forming the basis of the contraindication. This is a classic 'SAFETY STOP' situation where the nurse's independent judgment prevents a potentially lethal medication error.",

Administering a negative inotropic agent like metoprolol could worsen hypotension and cardiogenic shock, directly contravening the goal of care."
