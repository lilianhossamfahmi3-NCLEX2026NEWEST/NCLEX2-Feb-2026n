    "correct": "The most life-threatening condition is hyperkalemia with cardiac instability. This is evidenced by the critically high serum potassium of 7.2 mEq/L and the classic ECG changes associated with severe hyperkalemia (tall, peaked T-waves and a widened QRS complex). These ECG findings indicate that the high potassium is affecting myocardial depolarization and repolarization, placing the client at imminent risk for ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The priority nursing actions must address this immediate threat. Administering IV calcium gluconate is the first-line intervention to stabilize the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of fatal arrhythmias. It does not lower the potassium level but protects the heart. The pathophysiology involves calcium competing with potassium at the cell membrane, restoring the normal excitability threshold. It is a critical safety action to withhold the scheduled lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), as it can worsen hyperkalemia by inhibiting aldosterone secretion, which would be catastrophic in this client. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing aldosterone production. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to track the client's response to treatment and detect any progression to lethal dysrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "While the client does have AKI and is becoming hypotensive, the immediate threat to life is cardiac arrest from severe hyperkalemia, as confirmed by the ECG. Focusing only on the AKI or hypotension without addressing the cardiac membrane instability would be a fatal error. Similarly, choosing slow-acting treatments for hyperkalemia or interventions that do not address the primary problem would delay life-saving care.",
