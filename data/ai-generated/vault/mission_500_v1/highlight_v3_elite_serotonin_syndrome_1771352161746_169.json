This is a life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity. The MAR shows the client is taking multiple serotonergic agents (sertraline, sumatriptan, ondansetron). Administering the scheduled dose of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), would be catastrophic and worsen the toxicity. The nurse must recognize these critical findings, withhold the medication (a 'safety stop' action), and immediately notify the provider to initiate emergency treatment.",
