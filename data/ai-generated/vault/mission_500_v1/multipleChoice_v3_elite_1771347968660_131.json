The combination of tearing back/abdominal pain, a known history of AAA, worsening hypotension and tachycardia, and a positive FAST exam confirms active, life-threatening internal bleeding. The elevated lactate indicates tissue hypoxia from poor perfusion. Administering lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, would cause vasodilation, which would catastrophically lower the client's already dangerously low blood pressure, eliminate any compensatory vasoconstriction, and accelerate cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's primary responsibility is to prevent harm ('non-maleficence'). Therefore, recognizing this lethal contraindication, withholding the medication, and immediately notifying the provider is the only safe and appropriate action.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent critical safety errors. Administering an antihypertensive during active hemorrhagic shock is a lethal mistake. Focusing on a non-life-threatening symptom (nausea) or proceeding with routine care demonstrates a failure to recognize and act on a life-threatening emergency.",

Lisinopril would cause further vasodilation, precipitating irreversible shock and cardiac arrest. The nurse must recognize this absolute contraindication and communicate the critical change in status to the provider for immediate surgical intervention."

                "justification": "This is incorrect and dangerous. While fluid resuscitation is necessary for shock, it is part of a larger damage control strategy that often involves 'permissive hypotension' until hemorrhage can be surgically controlled. Giving a small bolus will not correct the underlying problem enough to make an antihypertensive safe. Administering lisinopril after the bolus remains absolutely contraindicated and would negate any benefit from the fluid, causing severe hypotension."

While the client may be nauseous due to pain and hypotension, nausea is a minor symptom in the context of impending cardiovascular collapse. The nurse's focus must be on the life-threatening hemodynamic instability. Delaying action on the shock to treat nausea is inappropriate."
