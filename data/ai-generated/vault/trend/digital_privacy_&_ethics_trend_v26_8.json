      "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: J.B., a 68-year-old patient admitted for pneumonia, reports receiving unsolicited marketing emails about medical devices after his admission. He is concerned about a potential breach of his personal health information.\nBackground: J.B. has a history of hypertension and COPD. He uses a CPAP machine at night. He is alert and oriented, but anxious about the privacy issue. Admission was 2 days prior. He states the emails started this morning.\nAssessment: Patient is afebrile, vital signs stable. Lung sounds reveal scattered wheezes. He denies clicking any links in the emails but has forwarded one to his daughter for review. He's asking if the hospital shared his email. He also states he registered on a third party COPD support website two weeks prior to admission. \nRecommendation: Investigate the potential privacy breach, ensure patient reassurance and education on digital health privacy, and strengthen data security protocols. Consult with hospital IT and legal departments.",
