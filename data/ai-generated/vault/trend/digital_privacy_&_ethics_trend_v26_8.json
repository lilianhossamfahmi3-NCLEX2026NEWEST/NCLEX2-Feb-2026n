He's alert and oriented but anxious about the privacy issue. Admitted two days prior, he noticed the emails this morning. He registered on a third-party COPD support website two weeks prior to admission.\nAssessment: Afebrile, stable vitals. Lung sounds show scattered wheezes. He denies clicking email links but forwarded one to his daughter. He questions if the hospital shared his email. \nRecommendation: Immediately investigate the potential privacy breach, reassure and educate J.B. on digital health privacy, and bolster data security. Consult hospital IT and legal.",
