        "correct": "The client exhibits a concerning trend of worsening respiratory function. Despite escalating FiO2 from 21% to 100%, the PaO2 continues to decline (82 mmHg to 62 mmHg), indicating refractory hypoxemia. This occurs because the lungs are unable to effectively transfer oxygen into the bloodstream, often due to conditions like ARDS or severe pneumonia where alveolar damage impairs gas exchange. Simultaneously, the PaCO2 is rising (44 mmHg to 68 mmHg), and the pH is falling (7.36 to 7.24), signifying hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis. This indicates the client's inability to effectively eliminate carbon dioxide, leading to its accumulation in the blood. This can be caused by alveolar hypoventilation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, or increased dead space ventilation. The combination of refractory hypoxemia and hypercapnia confirms the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure requiring immediate intervention.",
