An elevated FHR baseline (tachycardia) can be a sign of fetal distress or maternal fever. A decrease suggests improved fetal well-being.",
        "incorrectRationales": [
            "An increase in maternal blood pressure is not a therapeutic response; it could indicate preeclampsia or other complications. The slight increase observed is within an acceptable range but requires continued monitoring.",
            "An increase in contraction frequency indicates labor is progressing, but it doesn't necessarily reflect a therapeutic response to interventions aimed at improving fetal well-being. It is a normal progression of labor.",
            "Increased pain despite epidural placement indicates the epidural is not fully effective or needs adjustment, not a therapeutic response. The goal is pain reduction."
        ],
        "correct": "A decreasing FHR baseline towards a normal range (110-160 bpm) suggests improved fetal well-being following interventions. The epidural placement likely contributed to this improvement by reducing maternal stress and potentially improving uteroplacental perfusion.",

Potential causes include maternal fever, fetal hypoxia, and maternal dehydration. Addressing the underlying cause is essential for fetal well-being. Epidural placement can indirectly improve fetal well-being by reducing maternal stress and pain."
