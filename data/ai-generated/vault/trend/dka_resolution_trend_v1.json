    "correct": "At 0800, the client's lab values indicate resolution of DKA. The pH is approaching normal (7.32), glucose is controlled (180 mg/dL), and bicarbonate has improved significantly (21 mEq/L). The anion gap should also be closing. The appropriate action is to transition to subcutaneous insulin to maintain glycemic control while discontinuing the IV insulin infusion. This prevents rebound hyperglycemia and allows for a more sustainable management approach as the client resumes oral intake. Overlapping the IV insulin with the first subQ dose for 1-2 hours is standard practice to prevent rebound hyperglycemia. \n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* DKA results from insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis, and breakdown of fatty acids into ketones. As insulin is administered, glucose is utilized, and ketone production decreases. The goal is to normalize pH and bicarbonate levels while preventing hypoglycemia. Once these parameters are met, transitioning to subcutaneous insulin allows for continued glucose control without the risks associated with continuous IV infusions.",
    "incorrect": "*Continuing the current regular insulin infusion rate:* Continuing the IV insulin infusion at the same rate could lead to hypoglycemia, as the client's glucose levels are already decreasing. \n\n*Doubling the IV insulin rate to reach a pH of 7.4:* Doubling the insulin rate is dangerous and could cause a rapid drop in blood glucose, leading to severe hypoglycemia and potential neurological damage. The current pH is acceptable, and further aggressive treatment is not warranted. \n\n*Discontinuing all insulin and starting a clear liquid diet:* Discontinuing all insulin is inappropriate, as the client still requires insulin to maintain glycemic control. Starting a clear liquid diet without insulin coverage would likely lead to rebound hyperglycemia.",
