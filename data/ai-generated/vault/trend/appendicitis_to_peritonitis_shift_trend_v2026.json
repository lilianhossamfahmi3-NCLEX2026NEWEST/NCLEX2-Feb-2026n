    "correctRationale": "A rising white blood cell count from 12,000/μL to 18,000/μL, in conjunction with other clinical findings such as increased pain, rigid abdomen, and absent bowel sounds, strongly suggests the client's condition is worsening and that appendicitis has progressed to peritonitis. This indicates a systemic inflammatory response to the infection.",
    "incorrectRationaleOptions": {
      "option_1": "Decreasing abdominal pain would generally indicate a therapeutic response or resolution of the underlying issue, not a worsening condition. However, sudden cessation of pain with peritonitis could indicate rupture, which is an emergency.",
      "option_2": "Increased bowel sounds, especially if previously hypoactive or absent, could indicate a return of normal function and improvement. However, in the context of peritonitis, it is more likely to be high-pitched tinkling sounds, which are not reflected in the option.",
      "option_4": "A decreasing heart rate from 110 bpm to 90 bpm, if associated with other improving vital signs, could indicate a response to treatment. However, in the context of sepsis, a drop in heart rate may be related to decompensation."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "The progression from appendicitis to peritonitis is marked by increasing abdominal pain, rigidity, rebound tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent sepsis and other complications.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to select decreasing pain or heart rate as signs of improvement, but they must consider the overall clinical picture and the potential for these findings to represent a more serious underlying issue, such as peritonitis or decompensation.",
    "mnemonic": "Worsening Peritonitis: WBC Rising, Pain Increasing, Peritoneal Signs (Rigidity, Rebound tenderness), Poor Vitals",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
