    "correct": "Lactate is a key indicator of tissue perfusion and anaerobic metabolism in sepsis. A decreasing lactate level indicates improved tissue oxygenation and resolution of metabolic acidosis, suggesting the treatment is effective. Blood pressure improvement from 80/40 to 90/60 and then 95/65 indicates better perfusion. Urine output is reflective of kidney function and overall perfusion. An increase suggests better kidney function. WBC trend is indicative of the immune system's response to infection. Stable WBC indicates the infection is being controlled.",
    "incorrect": "An increasing lactate indicates worsening anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoperfusion, suggesting the current treatment is ineffective. A stable blood pressure at a low level (e.g., 90/60) indicates persistent hemodynamic instability and inadequate tissue perfusion. A decreasing urine output signals declining kidney function and may indicate worsening perfusion. A changing WBC count indicates the immune system is responding to treatment.",
