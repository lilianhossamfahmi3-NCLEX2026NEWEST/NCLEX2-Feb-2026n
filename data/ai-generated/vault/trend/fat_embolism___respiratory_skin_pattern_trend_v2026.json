      "option_1": "A decreasing oxygen saturation indicates worsening respiratory function, not a therapeutic response. This would suggest the interventions are not effectively addressing the client's oxygenation needs.",

      "option_4": "Increased confusion and agitation suggests worsening cerebral hypoxia, which is a serious complication of fat embolism. This indicates a deterioration of the client's condition, not a therapeutic response."
