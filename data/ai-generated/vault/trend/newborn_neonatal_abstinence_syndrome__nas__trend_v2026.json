    "correctRationale": "Decreased tremors and improved sleep patterns at 1100, along with a decreasing NAS score, indicate that the interventions (swaddling and morphine administration) are having a therapeutic effect in reducing the infant's withdrawal symptoms. The infant is showing signs of stabilization and improved comfort.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Increased irritability and a high-pitched cry are signs of worsening withdrawal symptoms, not a therapeutic response.",
      "option_2": "Decreased muscle tone and lethargy can be concerning and might indicate over-sedation or other complications, not necessarily a therapeutic response to NAS treatment. Further assessment is needed to rule out other potential issues.",
      "option_4": "Frequent sneezing and nasal stuffiness are common symptoms of NAS but do not, on their own, indicate a therapeutic response to interventions. They are part of the initial presentation of the syndrome."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring trends in NAS scores and specific symptoms is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. A comprehensive approach, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures, is often necessary for optimal management.",
    "questionTrap": "Be careful not to assume that any single symptom improvement indicates overall therapeutic success. The nurse must evaluate the totality of the trend. Lethargy (Option 2) might appear positive, but in the context of NAS treatment, it's crucial to differentiate between appropriate sedation and over-sedation.",
