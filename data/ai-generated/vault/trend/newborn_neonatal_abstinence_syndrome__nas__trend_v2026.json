    "correctRationale": "Decreased tremors and improved sleep patterns at 1100, along with a decreasing NAS score from 12 to 7, indicate a positive therapeutic response to the interventions (swaddling and morphine administration). These findings suggest a reduction in the infant's withdrawal symptoms and improved comfort.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Increased irritability and a high-pitched cry are signs of worsening withdrawal symptoms, indicating the interventions are not effectively managing the NAS. This would suggest a need to reassess the treatment plan.",
      "option_2": "Decreased muscle tone and lethargy can be concerning and might indicate over-sedation from the morphine or other complications. This requires further assessment to rule out adverse effects and potential need for intervention adjustment, not a therapeutic response.",
      "option_4": "Frequent sneezing and nasal stuffiness are common symptoms of NAS but do not, on their own, indicate a therapeutic response to interventions. While these symptoms may eventually decrease with effective treatment, their presence at 0900 does not signify improvement."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring trends in NAS scores and specific symptoms is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. A comprehensive approach, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures, is often necessary for optimal management. Be vigilant for signs of over-sedation when using morphine.",
    "questionTrap": "Be careful not to assume that any single symptom improvement indicates overall therapeutic success. The nurse must evaluate the totality of the trend. Lethargy (Option 2) might appear positive, but in the context of NAS treatment, it's crucial to differentiate between appropriate sedation and over-sedation. Consider the NAS score in conjunction with the observed symptoms.",
