        "correctRationale": "A weight increase from 3.2 kg to 3.3 kg over three hours indicates a positive response to interventions aimed at improving nutritional intake and growth. This demonstrates that the infant is retaining and utilizing nutrients effectively. The increase in oral intake and the decrease in irritability and regurgitation further support this conclusion.",
        "incorrectRationales": [
            "Decreased oral intake indicates a worsening condition, as the infant is not consuming sufficient nutrients. This would be a negative response to the interventions.",
            "Increased regurgitation suggests that the infant is not tolerating feedings well, potentially leading to further weight loss or failure to thrive. This indicates the interventions are not effective.",
            "Increased irritability can be a sign of discomfort or unmet needs, potentially related to hunger or digestive issues, indicating a lack of therapeutic response. This suggests the interventions are not working."
        ],
        "clinicalPearls": "Consistent monitoring of weight, intake, tolerance to feedings, and behavioral cues are crucial in managing infants with failure to thrive. A small but sustained weight gain, coupled with improved feeding tolerance and reduced irritability, is a key indicator of successful intervention.",
        "questionTrap": "The question trap lies in focusing on isolated data points rather than the overall trend. While a single instance of regurgitation or fussiness might be concerning, the overall trend of weight gain, increased intake, and improved tolerance is more significant in evaluating the therapeutic response.",
        "mnemonic": "WIT (Weight, Intake, Tolerance): Remember to assess these three factors when evaluating the therapeutic response in infants with failure to thrive. Also consider the infant's overall well-being and behavior.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale aligned and validated."
