      "option_1": "Increased sputum production, especially with purulent characteristics, suggests worsening infection or ineffective treatment. This is an undesirable outcome.",
      "option_2": "Hemoptysis (blood in sputum) is a concerning sign that could indicate lung damage or worsening of the TB infection, rather than a therapeutic response.",
      "option_4": "An increasing temperature indicates a possible worsening of the infection or a lack of response to the current treatment regimen. A decreasing temperature would be a more favorable sign."

Improvement in these parameters suggests a positive response to therapy. Sputum cultures are essential for diagnosis and monitoring treatment effectiveness.",
