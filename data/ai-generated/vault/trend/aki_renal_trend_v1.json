    "correct": "The patient's creatinine has tripled in 72 hours, BUN has nearly quadrupled, and urine output has decreased significantly to 200 mL/day, meeting the criteria for oliguria (<400 mL/day). This rapid deterioration in renal function over a short period strongly indicates Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), specifically the oliguric phase. In AKI, damage to the nephrons reduces the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), leading to decreased urine output and retention of waste products like creatinine and BUN. The oliguric phase is characterized by a significant reduction in urine production due to tubular damage and backleak of filtrate.",
