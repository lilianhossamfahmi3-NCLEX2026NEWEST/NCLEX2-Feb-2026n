    "correctRationale": "Increasing deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) from absent to 2+ indicates a therapeutic response to the interventions. In preeclampsia, magnesium sulfate is administered to prevent seizures. The goal is to maintain DTRs at 1-2+. The initial absent DTRs suggest magnesium toxicity, and the progression towards 2+ indicates the magnesium level is decreasing and the client is recovering from the toxicity while still receiving therapeutic benefit.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "A respiratory rate decreasing further towards 10 breaths/min indicates worsening magnesium toxicity, as respiratory depression is a key sign. The therapeutic goal is to maintain a safe respiratory rate, not to lower it further. This would warrant immediate intervention.",
      "option_3": "While a slight increase in blood pressure may be seen with improved condition, it's not the most direct indicator of reversing magnesium toxicity. The primary concern with magnesium toxicity is neuromuscular and respiratory depression, not blood pressure changes. Blood pressure control is a separate goal in managing preeclampsia.",
      "option_4": "A declining level of consciousness is a sign of worsening magnesium toxicity, not a therapeutic response. Magnesium toxicity can cause central nervous system depression, leading to decreased alertness and potentially coma. This would warrant immediate intervention."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Assess DTRs frequently in patients receiving magnesium sulfate. Absent or diminished DTRs can indicate magnesium toxicity, while hyperreflexia can indicate preeclampsia worsening. The therapeutic window for magnesium sulfate is narrow, requiring careful monitoring and titration.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may focus on changes in vital signs like respiratory rate or blood pressure. However, the MOST specific indicator of resolving magnesium toxicity while maintaining therapeutic effect is the return of DTRs within the target range (1-2+). Emphasize the importance of recognizing the specific signs of magnesium toxicity and their reversal in the context of magnesium sulfate therapy for preeclampsia.",
    "mnemonic": "Magnesium toxicity: Think 'SLOW' – Slow reflexes (hyporeflexia/areflexia), Low BP, and Slow respirations. Reversal: Gradual return of reflexes towards normal (1-2+) indicates improvement.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale aligned with deep clinical understanding of magnesium sulfate therapy in preeclampsia."
