    "correctRationale": "Increasing deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) from absent to 2+ indicates that the magnesium sulfate is being metabolized and the client is recovering from magnesium toxicity. The goal of magnesium sulfate administration in preeclampsia is to prevent seizures, and the dosage is often adjusted to maintain DTRs at 1-2+.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "A respiratory rate decreasing further towards 10 breaths/min would indicate worsening magnesium toxicity, as respiratory depression is a key sign. The therapeutic goal is to maintain a safe respiratory rate, not to lower it further.",
      "option_3": "While a slight increase in blood pressure may be seen with improved condition, it's not the most direct indicator of reversing magnesium toxicity. The primary concern with magnesium toxicity is neuromuscular and respiratory depression, not blood pressure changes.",
      "option_4": "A declining level of consciousness is a sign of worsening magnesium toxicity, not a therapeutic response. Magnesium toxicity can cause central nervous system depression, leading to decreased alertness and even coma."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Assess DTRs frequently in patients receiving magnesium sulfate. Absent or diminished DTRs can indicate magnesium toxicity, while hyperreflexia can indicate preeclampsia worsening. The therapeutic window for magnesium sulfate is narrow, requiring careful monitoring.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may be drawn to changes in vital signs like respiratory rate or blood pressure, but the MOST specific indicator of resolving magnesium toxicity is the return of DTRs. Highlight the importance of recognizing the specific signs of magnesium toxicity and their reversal.",
    "mnemonic": "Magnesium toxicity: Think 'SLOW' – Slow reflexes (hyporeflexia/areflexia), Low BP, and Slow respirations. Reversal: Increasing reflexes indicate improvement.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
