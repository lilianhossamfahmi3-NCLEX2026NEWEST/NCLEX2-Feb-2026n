    "correctRationale": "The vital signs and nurse's notes indicate that the late decelerations are becoming less frequent and less severe, which is a positive response to the interventions implemented (oxygen, position change, IV fluids). This suggests improved uteroplacental perfusion and fetal oxygenation.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "Worsening late decelerations indicate fetal distress, not a therapeutic response. This would necessitate further intervention.",
      "Decreased variability can indicate fetal compromise, such as fetal sleep cycle, medication effects, or hypoxia, not improvement. Moderate variability is reassuring.",
      "An increasing maternal blood pressure may indicate preeclampsia or other complications, not a therapeutic response to interventions for fetal distress. It warrants further investigation."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency. Interventions such as oxygen administration, position changes, and IV fluid boluses aim to improve placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation. A positive response is indicated by a reduction in the frequency and severity of late decelerations. Remember the mnemonic LION (Left lateral, IV fluids, Oxygen, Notify).",
    "questionTrap": "Students might incorrectly assume that any change in vital signs is a positive sign, without analyzing the specific change and its clinical significance. Focusing on the trend of the fetal heart rate decelerations in conjunction with the interventions is crucial.",
    "mnemonic": "LION (Left lateral, IV fluids, Oxygen, Notify) – interventions for late decelerations. Improvement means the 'LION' is working!",
    "correct": "The correct answer is option 4. The data shows a trend of decreasing frequency and severity of late decelerations, indicating a positive response to interventions aimed at improving uteroplacental perfusion."
