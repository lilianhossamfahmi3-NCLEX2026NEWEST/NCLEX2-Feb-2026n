    "correctRationale": "The primary goal in managing aortic dissection is to reduce the stress on the aortic wall by lowering blood pressure. A decrease in systolic blood pressure from 180 mmHg to 150 mmHg indicates the beta-blocker is effectively reducing the force of ventricular contraction and the pressure on the aortic wall, demonstrating a therapeutic response.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "While increased urine output suggests improved renal perfusion, it is a secondary indicator and not the primary therapeutic goal in the acute management of aortic dissection. Blood pressure control is paramount to prevent further dissection or rupture.",
      "option_2": "A decrease in chest pain is a positive sign and indicates the client is more comfortable, but it is subjective and can be influenced by analgesics. The priority is to control blood pressure to minimize the risk of further dissection or rupture.",
      "option_4": "An increasing heart rate is a concerning finding and could indicate hypovolemia, pain, or an inadequate response to beta-blocker therapy. In the context of aortic dissection, the goal is typically to lower the heart rate to reduce the stress on the aorta."

  "clinicalPearls": "In aortic dissection, rapid blood pressure control is crucial to prevent further dissection or rupture. Beta-blockers are often the first-line treatment to reduce heart rate and the force of ventricular contraction. The target systolic blood pressure is typically between 100-120 mmHg.",
  "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to choose the decrease in chest pain, but while important for comfort, it is not the most direct and objective indicator of therapeutic response. The primary goal is hemodynamic stabilization, reflected in the blood pressure.",
