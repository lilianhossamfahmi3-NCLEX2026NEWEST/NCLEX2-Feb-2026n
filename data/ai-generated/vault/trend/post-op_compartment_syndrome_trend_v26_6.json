    "correct": "Compartment syndrome is characterized by the '6 Ps': pain (especially with passive movement), pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness, and poikilothermia. Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a key early sign. Paresthesia is also an early finding. Pulselessness is a late sign, as is paralysis. Capillary refill is not a reliable indicator. Increased swelling contributes to increased pressure within the compartment.",
    "incorrect": "Pain controlled with analgesics suggests adequate pain management and does not point towards compartment syndrome. Intact motor function indicates no nerve damage or muscle ischemia at the time of the assessment. A palpable peripheral pulse indicates adequate arterial blood flow to the extremity, reducing the likelihood of compartment syndrome. Capillary refill less than 3 seconds is normal and does not suggest compartment syndrome. Although swelling can contribute to compartment syndrome, swelling alone is not necessarily indicative of compartment syndrome.",
