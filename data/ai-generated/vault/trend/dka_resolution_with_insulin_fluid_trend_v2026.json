  "rationale": {
    "correctRationale": "Decreasing blood glucose levels from 450 to 150 over the course of 3 hours indicates that the insulin drip is effectively lowering the patient's blood sugar and reversing the hyperglycemia associated with DKA. This, coupled with the patient's subjective report of feeling better, points toward a therapeutic response.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Decreasing serum bicarbonate levels would indicate a worsening of acidosis, not a therapeutic response. Bicarbonate levels should increase as the DKA resolves.",
      "option_2": "An increased anion gap suggests that the metabolic acidosis is worsening, which is the opposite of a therapeutic response. A decreasing anion gap is expected with successful treatment.",
      "option_3": "Rising blood glucose levels would indicate that the insulin therapy is not effective and the DKA is not resolving. The goal is to lower the blood glucose to a safe range."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Monitor blood glucose levels hourly during insulin infusion for DKA. A consistent decrease is a positive sign.",
      "Assess the patient's subjective symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea) to correlate with objective data (e.g., blood glucose, pH).",
      "Be aware that rapid correction of hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as hypokalemia and cerebral edema."
    ],
    "questionTrap": "Students might choose 'Decreasing serum bicarbonate' if they focus solely on acidosis without recognizing that the trend should be toward correction, not further decline.",
