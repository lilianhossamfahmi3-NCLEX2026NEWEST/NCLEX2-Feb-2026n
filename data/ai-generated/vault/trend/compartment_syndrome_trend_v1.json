They initially reported manageable pain, but it has progressively worsened despite pain medication.\nAssessment: The client's pain is now rated 10/10, pulse is weak, and movement is significantly limited. These findings suggest possible compartment syndrome.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate notification of the healthcare provider for evaluation and consideration of emergent fasciotomy to relieve pressure and prevent irreversible tissue damage."
