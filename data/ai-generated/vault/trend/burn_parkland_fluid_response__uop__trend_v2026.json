    "incorrectRationales": [
      "While a slight decrease in heart rate might be a positive sign, it is not as direct an indicator of adequate fluid resuscitation as urine output.",
      "A decrease in systolic blood pressure is concerning and could indicate hypovolemia or other complications, not a therapeutic response.",

      "Adequate urine output is a key indicator of successful fluid resuscitation in burn patients following the Parkland formula.",
      "The target urine output for adults is typically 0.5 mL/kg/hr, or 30-50 mL/hr.",
