    "correctRationale": "A decrease in heart rate towards a normal range after administration of Digoxin Immune Fab (Digibind) indicates a therapeutic response. Digoxin toxicity often manifests as bradycardia. An increase in heart rate from 52 bpm to 68 bpm suggests the Digibind is effectively neutralizing the digoxin.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "An increase in the PR interval indicates worsening digoxin effect, not a therapeutic response. Digoxin toxicity prolongs the PR interval.",
      "An increase in the serum digoxin level indicates worsening toxicity, not a therapeutic response. The goal of Digibind is to neutralize digoxin, although serum levels may still appear elevated.",
      "The appearance of PVCs indicates worsening digoxin toxicity. PVCs are a common dysrhythmia associated with digoxin toxicity."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Digoxin toxicity can present with a variety of symptoms, including bradycardia, visual disturbances (blurred vision, yellow halos), nausea, vomiting, and ECG changes such as prolonged PR interval, ST depression, and arrhythmias. Digoxin levels should be monitored closely, and Digibind is the antidote for severe toxicity.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly assume that any change in heart rate is positive, without considering the context of digoxin toxicity and the desired therapeutic outcome of Digibind. They may also focus on the increasing digoxin level without understanding that Digibind binds to digoxin, making it inactive but not necessarily lowering the measured serum level immediately.",
    "mnemonic": "Bradycardia and visual disturbances signal potential 'Digi-toxicity'. Remember to check the 'Digi' level and ECG!"
