  "rationale": {
    "correctRationale": "The client's heart rate increasing from 52 bpm to 68 bpm indicates a therapeutic response to Digibind. Digoxin toxicity causes bradycardia, and Digibind reverses this effect by binding to digoxin and preventing it from affecting the heart.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "An increase in the PR interval indicates worsening digoxin toxicity, not a therapeutic response. Digoxin toxicity prolongs the PR interval.",
      "An increase in the serum digoxin level is expected after Digibind administration. Digibind binds to digoxin, making it inactive, but the complex is still detected in serum assays. This does not indicate a therapeutic failure.",
      "The appearance of PVCs indicates worsening digoxin toxicity. PVCs are a common dysrhythmia associated with digoxin toxicity and should decrease with effective treatment."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Digoxin toxicity can present with a variety of symptoms, including bradycardia, visual disturbances (blurred vision, yellow halos), nausea, vomiting, and ECG changes such as prolonged PR interval, ST depression, and arrhythmias. Digoxin levels should be monitored closely, and Digibind is the antidote for severe toxicity. After Digibind administration, serum digoxin levels will be elevated but the digoxin is inactive.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly assume that any change in heart rate is positive, without considering the context of digoxin toxicity and the desired therapeutic outcome of Digibind. They may also focus on the increasing digoxin level without understanding that Digibind binds to digoxin, making it inactive but not necessarily lowering the measured serum level immediately. Students may also not recognize that the therapeutic effect of Digibind is to reverse the effects of digoxin, not necessarily to immediately lower the digoxin level.",
    "mnemonic": "Bradycardia, visual disturbances, and prolonged PR interval suggest 'Digi-toxicity'. Think 'Digibind' to reverse the effects!",
    "correct": "The correct answer is option 2. The increase in heart rate from 52 bpm to 68 bpm indicates a therapeutic response to Digibind, as it reverses the bradycardia caused by digoxin toxicity."
