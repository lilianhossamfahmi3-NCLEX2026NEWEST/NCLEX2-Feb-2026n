Thyroid storm is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state resulting from excessive thyroid hormone release. The pathophysiology involves an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response due to increased levels of T3 and T4. This leads to increased oxygen consumption, cardiac dysfunction (tachycardia, arrhythmias), hyperthermia, and central nervous system effects. This condition requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death. +1 point",
