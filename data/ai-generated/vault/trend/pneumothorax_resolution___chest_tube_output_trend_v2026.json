        "correctRationale": "A decrease in pain level from 7/10 to 3/10, along with improving vital signs (decreasing heart rate and respiratory rate, increasing oxygen saturation) and improved breath sounds, indicates that the pneumothorax is resolving and the patient is responding therapeutically to the interventions. The trend shows improvement across multiple parameters.",
        "incorrectRationales": {
            "option_1": "An increase in chest tube output, especially a significant jump, is concerning and could indicate bleeding or other complications. Therapeutic response is usually associated with a stable or decreasing output as the lung re-expands. Increased output may indicate a worsening condition or a complication.",
            "option_2": "An increase in respiratory rate suggests the patient is working harder to breathe, which is a sign of respiratory distress and a worsening condition, not a therapeutic response. An elevated respiratory rate indicates the patient is compensating for inadequate oxygenation.",
            "option_3": "A decrease in oxygen saturation indicates that the patient is not getting enough oxygen, which is a sign of respiratory compromise and a worsening condition, not a therapeutic response. Decreased oxygen saturation suggests worsening respiratory function."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "A therapeutic response to pneumothorax treatment is indicated by improvements in vital signs (decreased RR, increased SpO2), decreased pain, improved breath sounds, and a trend toward decreasing or stable chest tube output. Monitor for signs of complications such as increased chest tube output or respiratory distress. Serial assessments are crucial.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly focus solely on chest tube output without considering the overall clinical picture. A sudden increase in output is NOT a good sign and can indicate complications. Always assess the patient holistically.",
