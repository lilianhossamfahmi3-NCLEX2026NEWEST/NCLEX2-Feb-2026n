      "option_1": "An increase in chest tube output, especially a significant jump like this, could indicate bleeding or other complications rather than a therapeutic response. Output should be trending down as the lung re-expands.",
      "option_2": "An increase in respiratory rate from 22 breaths/min to 28 breaths/min suggests that the patient is working harder to breathe, which is a sign of respiratory distress and a worsening condition.",
      "option_3": "A decrease in oxygen saturation from 92% to 88% indicates that the patient is not getting enough oxygen, which is a sign of respiratory compromise and a worsening condition."
