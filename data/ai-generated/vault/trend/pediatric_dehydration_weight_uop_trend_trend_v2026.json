    "correctRationale": "A decrease in urine specific gravity indicates that the kidneys are concentrating urine less, suggesting improved hydration status and improved kidney perfusion. This is a positive response to the interventions aimed at rehydration. The trend from 1.030 to 1.020 demonstrates improved hydration.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "An increase in heart rate could indicate worsening dehydration or other underlying issues, rather than a therapeutic response. The heart rate should be trending downward as hydration improves. In this case, the heart rate is increasing, indicating a potential problem.",
      "option_3": "A minimal weight increase of 0.1 kg is not clinically significant in the context of rehydration, especially given the time frame. A more substantial weight gain would be expected with effective fluid replacement. The weight has remained essentially unchanged.",
      "option_4": "A decrease in oral fluid intake, even if the child is stooling less, does not indicate a therapeutic response. The goal is to increase oral intake to promote rehydration, and a decrease suggests the interventions are not optimally effective. Decreased intake is a negative finding."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring urine specific gravity is a crucial indicator of hydration status in pediatric patients. A decreasing specific gravity, in conjunction with other clinical improvements, suggests effective rehydration. Trends are more important than single values. Consider the overall clinical picture, including vital signs, weight, and urine output.",
    "questionTrap": "The question trap here is focusing on isolated data points rather than the overall trend. Students may be tempted by the weight increase or changes in oral intake without considering the whole clinical picture and the significance of urine specific gravity. Students should prioritize the most reliable indicator of rehydration.",
    "mnemonic": "Urine Specific Gravity (USG) – 'Upward Spiral Gravity' (High USG = Dehydration). Think of a spiral going up, indicating concentrated urine and dehydration. Conversely, a decreasing USG indicates improvement.",
    "correct": "A decreasing urine specific gravity is the best indicator of improved hydration status."
