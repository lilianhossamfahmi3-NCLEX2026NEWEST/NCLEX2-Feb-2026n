GBS is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. This demyelination disrupts nerve signal transmission, leading to progressive muscle weakness and sensory changes. The ascending pattern is due to the immune response typically starting in the distal extremities and progressing proximally. The highest priority in GBS is monitoring for respiratory failure. As the ascending paralysis reaches the thoracic nerves (T1-T12), the diaphragm, the primary muscle for breathing, can become paralyzed. This leads to hypoventilation, decreased oxygen saturation, and potential respiratory arrest. Frequent assessment of respiratory rate, depth, and effort, along with pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas (ABG) monitoring, is crucial. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing. ClinicalPearl: Always keep intubation equipment at the bedside for a patient with GBS whose weakness is progressing upward. Notify the provider immediately for any signs of respiratory distress (e.g., dyspnea, decreased SpO2, altered mental status).",

Stroke (c) involves unilateral (one-sided) weakness due to disruption of blood flow to a specific area of the brain. The onset is typically sudden. Meningitis (d) presents with fever, nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), headache, and altered mental status due to inflammation of the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).

Hypokalemia (K+ < 3.5 mEq/L) significantly increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in myocardial cells, increasing intracellular sodium and calcium. Hypokalemia enhances digoxin binding to this pump, leading to exaggerated effects, even at therapeutic digoxin levels. This results in increased myocardial contractility but also increased automaticity and decreased conduction velocity. The classic symptoms of digoxin toxicity include gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia), visual disturbances (yellow halos, blurred vision), and cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, heart block).

He's receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No active bleeding noted.\nAssessment: Platelet drop >50% suggests possible Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Patient denies new pain or swelling. Vitals stable: BP 120/80, HR 80, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air. Labs pending.\nRecommendation: Immediately discontinue heparin. Obtain HIT antibody testing. Initiate alternative anticoagulation (e.g., argatroban) per protocol. Monitor for signs of thrombosis. Notify provider immediately. Document all interventions. 0800: Heparin stopped. HIT labs drawn. Provider notified. Argatroban started per order."
