            "While the increased tidal volume might initially seem positive, it could be the body's attempt to compensate for increasing respiratory distress. The rising ETCO2 is a more direct and concerning indicator of worsening respiratory function and CO2 retention.",

            "Although the improved oxygen saturation is a positive finding, it doesn't negate the concerning increase in ETCO2. The client may be receiving supplemental oxygen, which artificially elevates the SpO2, masking the underlying hypoventilation and CO2 retention. The ETCO2 is a more sensitive indicator of respiratory compromise in this situation."

Key indicators include increased ETCO2, decreased tidal volume (in later stages), altered mental status, and signs of respiratory distress. Prompt intervention, including ventilatory support, is crucial. Always prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).",
