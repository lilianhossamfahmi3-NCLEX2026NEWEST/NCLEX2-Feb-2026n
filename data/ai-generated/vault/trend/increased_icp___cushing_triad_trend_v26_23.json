        "correct": "Cushing's triad is a classic but late sign of increased ICP and consists of hypertension with a widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations. The body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing blood pressure. The increased pressure stimulates the baroreceptors, leading to a reflex bradycardia. Changes in respiratory pattern occur as ICP affects the brainstem.",
        "incorrect": "Decreasing blood pressure indicates hypovolemia or shock, not increased ICP. Tachycardia can be caused by numerous factors, including pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia, but it is not typically associated with Cushing's triad. Increased respiratory rate can be caused by pain, anxiety, or hypoxemia, but bradypnea or irregular respirations are associated with Cushing's triad.",
