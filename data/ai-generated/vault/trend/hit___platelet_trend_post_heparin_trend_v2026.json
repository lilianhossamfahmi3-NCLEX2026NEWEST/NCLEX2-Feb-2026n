    "correctRationale": "An increasing platelet count after interventions for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) suggests the interventions are effective and the patient is recovering. A rise from 60,000/μL to 80,000/μL indicates bone marrow recovery and reduced platelet consumption. This demonstrates a positive response to treatment.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "A decreasing platelet count indicates worsening thrombocytopenia and is not a therapeutic response. This suggests the interventions are not working, or the condition is progressing.",
      "New onset of petechiae suggests active bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, indicating the condition is worsening, not improving. This is a sign of potential complications from HIT.",
      "Development of a new thrombus indicates ongoing or worsening hypercoagulability, a hallmark of HIT, and signifies a lack of therapeutic response. This is a serious adverse event."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "In HIT, the platelet count typically drops significantly (often below 100,000/μL), or by 50% from baseline. Monitoring platelet trends is crucial for early detection and management. A rise in platelet count after suspected HIT and intervention is a positive sign, indicating recovery.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to focus on the absolute platelet values, but the question emphasizes the *trend*. The lowest value (60,000) might trigger concern, but the *increase* demonstrates the therapeutic response and the effectiveness of interventions.",
    "mnemonic": "HIT Recovery: Higher is Healed.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale aligned with HIT treatment and monitoring principles."
