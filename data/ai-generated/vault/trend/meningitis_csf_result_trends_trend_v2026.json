While protein levels can be elevated in meningitis, an increase from the initial level would not suggest improvement.",
            "option_3": "Elevated glucose levels in CSF are not typical in bacterial meningitis. In bacterial meningitis, glucose levels are usually decreased due to bacterial consumption. Normal or elevated glucose levels would not indicate a therapeutic response. In this case, the glucose level remains constant, offering no indication of improvement.",
            "option_4": "The presence of Gram-positive bacteria indicates the continued presence of infection, not a therapeutic response. A therapeutic response would involve a reduction or elimination of bacteria. The persistence of Gram-positive bacteria suggests the antibiotic may not be fully effective yet, or the treatment duration is insufficient."

        "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring CSF results, particularly WBC count, protein, glucose, and Gram stain, is crucial in assessing the effectiveness of treatment for meningitis. A trend toward normalization of these values indicates a positive therapeutic response. Vital sign improvement should also correlate with CSF findings.",

This question requires integrating data from multiple tabs to accurately assess the therapeutic response.
