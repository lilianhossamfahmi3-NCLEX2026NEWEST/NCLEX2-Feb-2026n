        "correctRationale": "In Reye's syndrome, neurological status is a critical indicator of prognosis. An improvement in the level of consciousness, even from obtunded to lethargic, indicates a positive response to treatment.

            "option_1": "Increased lethargy would indicate a worsening condition, not a therapeutic response.",
            "option_2": "Elevated AST and ALT levels indicate ongoing liver damage and do not represent a therapeutic response. In Reye's syndrome, these levels are expected to be elevated but should eventually decrease with successful treatment.",
            "option_3": "While a decreased heart rate can be a positive sign in some conditions, it is not the most direct indicator of therapeutic response in Reye's syndrome. The primary concern in Reye's syndrome is neurological status and liver function. The heart rate change is likely due to improved hydration and decreased stress.",
            "option_4": "Although this is the correct answer, it's important to note that further improvement in LOC is desired. This change represents an initial positive response."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "In Reye's syndrome, neurological status is a critical indicator of prognosis. Even subtle improvements in level of consciousness should be recognized as a positive response to interventions. Liver enzymes may lag behind neurological improvements. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes.",
        "questionTrap": "Students might be distracted by the vital signs (HR) or lab values (AST/ALT), but the core of Reye's is encephalopathy. Focus on the LOC changes. Also, students may assume that a therapeutic response means complete resolution, but in this case, it's an initial improvement.",
        "mnemonic": "Reye's: Remember 'Liver and Brain' - focus on both hepatic and neurological improvements. Think LOC first!",
        "correct": "The correct answer is option 4 because improved level of consciousness, even from obtunded to lethargic, indicates a positive response to treatment in Reye's syndrome. While AST/ALT levels may not immediately decrease, neurological improvement is a key indicator of recovery. The other options indicate worsening or stable, but not improving, conditions."
