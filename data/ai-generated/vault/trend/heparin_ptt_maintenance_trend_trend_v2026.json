This demonstrates a positive response to the heparin infusion and indicates the client is moving towards effective anticoagulation without excessive risk of bleeding. The nurse's notes also confirm this trend.",
        "incorrectRationales": {
            "option_1": "An increase in PTT from 30 seconds to 35 seconds, while an increase, still indicates the client is subtherapeutic. The therapeutic range for PTT during heparin therapy is typically 60-80 seconds. This indicates the heparin is not yet effective.",
            "option_3": "A decrease in platelet count from 250,000/μL to 200,000/μL could be concerning, as it may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious complication of heparin therapy. This does not indicate a therapeutic response to heparin. Further investigation is needed.",
            "option_4": "An increase in heart rate from 80 bpm to 95 bpm is not directly indicative of a therapeutic response to heparin. It could be due to various factors, such as pain, anxiety, or other underlying conditions. It requires further assessment to determine the cause."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "When monitoring heparin therapy, the PTT should be assessed regularly to ensure it is within the therapeutic range (typically 60-80 seconds). Too high of a PTT indicates increased risk of bleeding, while too low of a PTT indicates increased risk of clotting. Platelet counts should also be monitored to assess for HIT. Always correlate lab values with clinical findings.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly assume that any change in PTT indicates a therapeutic response, without considering whether the change brings the PTT closer to the target range. Students may also focus on platelet count changes but fail to appreciate that the key indicator of heparin effectiveness is the PTT. Review the target PTT range.",
        "mnemonic": "PTT for Heparin: Think 'Therapeutic Target'. We want the PTT to trend towards the 'Target' (60-80 seconds).",
        "correct": "The therapeutic effect of heparin is measured by the PTT. The target range is 60-80 seconds. A decrease from 90 to 75 seconds indicates the client is approaching the therapeutic range."
