      "SBAR": "13:00. S: J.M., a 68-year-old male, arrived via ambulance. He is confused and lethargic. States he has been increasingly thirsty for three days, despite drinking fluids. History of Type 2 Diabetes, managed with oral agents. Reports non-adherence to medication regimen for the past week. B: Found unresponsive at home by his daughter. Daughter reports patient has had a recent upper respiratory infection. No known allergies. A: On arrival: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 32 and deep, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 36.2°C (97.2°F). Glucose via glucometer reads >600 mg/dL (lab pending). Not oriented to person, place, or time. Skin is warm and dry, with poor skin turgor. Initial ABG pending. Current medications: Metformin 500 mg BID, Glipizide 5 mg daily. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath prior to becoming unresponsive. P: Will update with lab results and physician orders. Anticipate fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is in progress.",

      "option1": "Correct. After initial fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances, a continuous intravenous insulin infusion should be initiated to gradually lower the blood glucose level. An IV bolus is often the initial step prior to the infusion.",
      "option2": "Correct. The initial priority in managing DKA/HHS is to address dehydration with rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation. 0.9% normal saline is typically the initial fluid of choice to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion.",
      "option3": "Correct. The patient's potassium level is low (3.0 mEq/L), and potassium replacement is crucial, especially before initiating insulin therapy, as insulin can cause further intracellular shifting of potassium, potentially leading to life-threatening hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. DKA causes osmotic diuresis leading to potassium loss.",
      "option4": "Correct. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess the patient's response to fluid resuscitation and to detect any signs of kidney injury or inadequate perfusion.",
      "option5": "Incorrect. Sodium bicarbonate is generally not indicated in DKA/HHS unless the pH is severely low (<7.0), as it can paradoxically worsen intracellular acidosis and lead to other complications.",
      "option6": "Incorrect. While an ECG might be considered, it is not an immediate priority. The priority is to address life-threatening issues (fluid deficit, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia).",
      "option7": "Correct. Assessing the patient's level of consciousness and neurological status is crucial to monitor for cerebral edema or other neurological complications associated with severe hyperglycemia and rapid changes in serum osmolality. This is especially important in HHS."
