            "option_1": "An increased pain level despite analgesic administration suggests that the current pain management strategy is ineffective and requires further assessment and intervention. This indicates a worsening condition, not a therapeutic response.",
            "option_2": "Increased surgical drain output, especially if the drainage is sanguineous (bloody), can indicate bleeding or other complications at the surgical site. This is not a sign of a therapeutic response and requires immediate attention.",
            "option_4": "Decreased range of motion and increased stiffness in the affected leg suggest potential complications such as contracture, inadequate rehabilitation, or the development of scar tissue. This is not a sign of a therapeutic response and warrants further investigation and intervention."

        "clinicalPearls": "Post-operative pain management and monitoring of surgical drain output are crucial in total hip replacement. Effective pain control facilitates early mobilization, reduces the risk of complications, and promotes faster recovery. Changes in drainage characteristics (color, amount) should be closely monitored and reported.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students may focus solely on the drainage aspect, overlooking the importance of pain as a key indicator of the client's overall therapeutic response. The correct answer requires recognizing the combined effect of pain reduction and decreased need for analgesics as a positive sign of recovery.",
