    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Decreased urine output is a concerning finding in preeclampsia, potentially indicating worsening renal function. However, it is not as acutely dangerous as neurological symptoms like blurred vision, which suggest imminent risk of seizure.",
      "option_2": "An increase in systolic blood pressure is expected in preeclampsia, but the increase from 160 mmHg to 170 mmHg, while requiring attention, is not the most immediate indicator of worsening condition compared to new-onset neurological symptoms.",
      "option_3": "A decrease in deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) can indicate magnesium toxicity, a potential complication of magnesium sulfate administration. While important to monitor, the new onset of visual disturbances is a more critical indicator of worsening preeclampsia and potential progression to eclampsia."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "New onset visual disturbances in a patient with preeclampsia are a critical finding that requires immediate intervention to prevent seizures. Report any visual changes immediately to the healthcare provider. Assess for other neurological symptoms such as headache, hyperreflexia, and clonus.",
    "questionTrap": "Many students might be tempted to choose the blood pressure or urine output changes, as these are common signs of preeclampsia. However, the question is asking about the 'most clear' indication of worsening, which shifts the focus to the new neurological symptom. Students must prioritize neurological changes as indicators of imminent eclampsia.",
    "mnemonic": "For preeclampsia/eclampsia: HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) + Neuro (headache, visual changes, hyperreflexia) = BAD. Indicates high risk for seizure.",
    "correct": "The correct answer is option 4. Blurred vision is a sign of worsening preeclampsia and can indicate impending eclampsia. This neurological symptom suggests increased cerebral edema and potential for seizure activity."
