    "correctRationale": "Increased oxygen saturation from 88% to 96% indicates that the supplemental oxygen therapy is effectively displacing carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, leading to improved oxygen delivery to tissues. This is the most direct indicator of a therapeutic response.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "While a decreased heart rate can be a sign of overall improvement, it is not the most direct indicator of a therapeutic response to carbon monoxide poisoning treatment. The heart rate may decrease as the body's tissues receive more oxygen, but the primary goal is to increase oxygen saturation.",
      "option_2": "An increased respiratory rate can indicate that the patient is still struggling to oxygenate their tissues. In the context of carbon monoxide poisoning treatment, an increasing respiratory rate may suggest that the treatment is not yet fully effective or that the patient is experiencing other respiratory complications.",
      "option_3": "An increased carboxyhemoglobin level indicates that the carbon monoxide poisoning is worsening, not improving. The goal of treatment is to decrease the carboxyhemoglobin level, allowing more oxygen to bind to hemoglobin."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "In carbon monoxide poisoning, monitor carboxyhemoglobin levels, oxygen saturation, and neurological status frequently. High-flow oxygen is the primary treatment. Be alert for delayed neurological sequelae.",
    "questionTrap": "Students might choose a decreasing heart rate or a stable respiratory rate, missing that oxygen saturation directly reflects the therapeutic effect of oxygen administration in CO poisoning. Watch for the carboxyhemoglobin level trap – a higher level indicates worsening condition, not improvement.",
