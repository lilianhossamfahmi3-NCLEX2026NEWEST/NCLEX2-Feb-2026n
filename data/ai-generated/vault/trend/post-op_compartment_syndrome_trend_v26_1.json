He had a left tibial fracture repair at 03:00 today and is now reporting increasing pain in his left lower leg, rated 8/10, despite receiving prescribed oxycodone 5mg PO at 06:00. The dressing is dry and intact, but his toes appear pale. His vital signs are stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air. Pulses are palpable but weak. \n07:05: I'm concerned about potential compartment syndrome given the sudden increase in pain, pallor, and new onset of numbness in his left foot. Passive dorsiflexion of the foot elicits extreme pain. The patient is alert and oriented but increasingly anxious. \n07:10: I recommend immediate assessment for compartment syndrome including intracompartmental pressure measurement. I have elevated the limb and notified you. Do you have any further orders at this time?",

Following a tibial fracture repair, swelling and edema can occur, increasing the pressure within the fascial compartments of the lower leg. This increased pressure can compress blood vessels and nerves, leading to ischemia and nerve damage. Key signs and symptoms include pain out of proportion to the injury, pallor (paleness), paresthesia (numbness), and pain with passive stretching of the muscles in the compartment. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage. Elevated CK may indicate muscle damage, which can occur in compartment syndrome, though it is not a primary diagnostic indicator. The pain is often described as being unrelieved by analgesics.",
