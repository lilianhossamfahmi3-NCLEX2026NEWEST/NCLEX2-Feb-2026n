      "SBAR": "**Situation:** J.M. is a 68-year-old male admitted for septic shock secondary to pneumonia, diagnosed 2 days ago. He is currently hypotensive despite initial fluid resuscitation.\n\n**Background:** Patient presented to the ED with fever, cough, and altered mental status. Blood cultures and sputum cultures were positive for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Initial treatment included IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin).\n\n**Assessment:** Currently, at 07:00, the patient is hypotensive, and requires vasopressor support. Arterial line indicates a MAP of 60 mmHg. CVP is 4 mmHg. Urine output has been minimal over the last 2 hours (20 mL/hr). Patient is on a ventilator with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. ABG shows pH 7.30, PaCO2 50 mmHg, PaO2 85 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Patient is sedated with Propofol.\n\n**Recommendation:** Increase vasopressor dose. Consider further fluid resuscitation. Obtain a lactate level. Monitor urine output closely. Consult nephrology if urine output does not improve. Obtain a chest X-ray to assess for worsening pneumonia.",
