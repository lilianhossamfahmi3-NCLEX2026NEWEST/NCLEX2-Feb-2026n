He remains hypotensive despite initial fluid resuscitation.\n\n**Background:** Patient presented to the ED with fever, cough, and altered mental status. Blood and sputum cultures confirmed *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Initial treatment included IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin).\n\n**Assessment:** At 07:00, the patient is hypotensive, requiring vasopressor support. Arterial line MAP is 60 mmHg. CVP is 4 mmHg. Urine output has been minimal over the last 2 hours (20 mL/hr). He is ventilated with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5 cm H2O. ABG: pH 7.30, PaCO2 50 mmHg, PaO2 85 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Patient is sedated with Propofol.\n\n**Recommendation:** Increase vasopressor dose. Consider further fluid resuscitation cautiously. Obtain a lactate level. Monitor urine output closely. Consult nephrology if urine output remains low. Obtain a chest X-ray to assess for worsening pneumonia.",
