      "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. Jones, a 68-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, was admitted at 14:00 for altered mental status. Background: He manages his diabetes with oral agents but has had a recent upper respiratory infection. Assessment: Upon arrival, he was lethargic, with deep, rapid respirations. His glucose was 680 mg/dL via glucometer. The initial venous blood gas showed pH 7.22, PaCO2 28 mmHg, and HCO3 12 mEq/L. He has ketones present in his urine. Vitals at 14:15 were: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 32, Temp 36.8°C (98.2°F), SpO2 96% on room air. Recommendation: I recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline, an insulin drip, and close monitoring of his electrolytes and blood glucose. We need to monitor for signs of cerebral edema as we correct his hyperosmolarity.",
