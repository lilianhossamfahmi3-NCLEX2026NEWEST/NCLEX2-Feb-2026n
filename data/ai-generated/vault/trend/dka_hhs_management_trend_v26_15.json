Background: He manages his diabetes with oral agents but has had a recent upper respiratory infection. Assessment: At 14:15, the patient was lethargic, with Kussmaul respirations. Glucometer reading was 680 mg/dL. Initial venous blood gas: pH 7.22, PaCO2 28 mmHg, HCO3 12 mEq/L. Urine ketones are positive. Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 32, Temp 36.8°C (98.2°F), SpO2 96% on room air. Recommendation: I recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline, continuous insulin infusion, close monitoring of electrolytes and glucose, and monitoring for cerebral edema.",
