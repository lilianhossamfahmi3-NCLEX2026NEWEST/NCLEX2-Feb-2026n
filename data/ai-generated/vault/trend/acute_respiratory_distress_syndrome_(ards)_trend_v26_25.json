            "options": {
                "hypoxemia": "Hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) is a primary indicator of ARDS due to alveolar fluid accumulation and impaired gas exchange. The inflammatory process reduces lung compliance, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting, decreasing arterial blood oxygen levels. clinicalPearl: Monitor SpO2 and ABGs closely to detect hypoxemia early.",
                "hypercapnia": "Hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) can occur in later stages of ARDS as the patient's respiratory muscles fatigue and alveolar ventilation decreases. Initially, patients may exhibit hypocapnia due to increased respiratory rate and tidal volume attempting to compensate for hypoxemia. questionTrap: Don't assume normal CO2 indicates stability; rising CO2 signals worsening respiratory failure.",
                "metabolic_acidosis": "Metabolic acidosis often occurs in ARDS due to anaerobic metabolism resulting from poor tissue oxygenation. As the body struggles to meet oxygen demands, lactic acid production increases, leading to a decrease in pH and bicarbonate levels. mnemonic: Remember 'MUDPILES' (Methanol, Uremia, DKA, Paraldehyde, Iron/Isoniazid, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates) as potential causes of metabolic acidosis.",
                "pulmonary_hypertension": "Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of ARDS. The inflammatory process and vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vasculature increase pulmonary artery pressure, leading to right ventricular strain. clinicalPearl: Monitor for signs of right heart failure (e.g., JVD, edema) in patients with ARDS.",
                "pneumothorax": "Pneumothorax can occur as a complication of mechanical ventilation, particularly with high pressures, but it is not a direct result of ARDS pathophysiology itself. High ventilator pressures can cause barotrauma leading to alveolar rupture and pneumothorax. questionTrap: While possible, pneumothorax is less directly related to the ABG findings than hypoxemia or hypercapnia in ARDS.",
                "administer_oxygen": "Administering supplemental oxygen is a critical intervention to treat hypoxemia. This improves oxygen delivery to the tissues and attempts to correct the ventilation-perfusion mismatch. High flow systems and/or positive pressure ventilation may be needed. clinicalPearl: Start with the least invasive method (e.g., nasal cannula, face mask) and escalate as needed based on ABGs and patient response.",
                "initiate_diuresis": "Diuretics are not typically indicated as an initial intervention in ARDS unless there is evidence of fluid overload compromising cardiac function. The primary issue is impaired gas exchange due to alveolar damage and inflammation, not fluid volume excess. questionTrap: Avoid focusing on fluid overload unless specifically indicated; the priority is improving oxygenation and ventilation.",
                "mechanical_ventilation": "Mechanical ventilation is often required in ARDS to support respiratory function and improve oxygenation. It allows for precise control of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and FiO2 to optimize gas exchange while minimizing further lung injury. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often used to keep alveoli open. mnemonic: 'PEEP' - Positive End-Expiratory Pressure helps keep alveoli open.",
                "bronchodilators": "Bronchodilators are not a primary intervention in ARDS because the main problem is not bronchospasm, but rather alveolar damage and inflammation. While bronchodilators can help improve airflow, they do not address the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS. questionTrap: Bronchodilators might help with underlying COPD but won't fix the ARDS-related gas exchange problem.",
                "prone_positioning": "Prone positioning is an effective strategy to improve oxygenation in ARDS. It redistributes lung perfusion, reduces compression of the posterior lung regions, and improves ventilation-perfusion matching. clinicalPearl: Prone positioning can significantly improve oxygenation but requires careful monitoring and specialized equipment.",
                "notify_hcp": "Notifying the healthcare provider is important to communicate the patient's deteriorating condition and implement further interventions. This step is crucial for timely management and potential escalation of care. clinicalPearl: Always communicate changes in patient status promptly to the healthcare provider.",
                "reassess_vitals": "Reassessing vital signs is essential to monitor the patient's response to interventions and to detect any further deterioration. This provides a continuous assessment of the patient's condition and guides further treatment decisions. clinicalPearl: Frequent vital sign monitoring is crucial in unstable patients.",
                "increase_tidal_volume": "Increasing tidal volume is generally avoided in ARDS due to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Lower tidal volumes are used to minimize alveolar overdistension. questionTrap: Higher tidal volumes can worsen lung injury in ARDS.",
                "obtain_abg": "Obtaining an arterial blood gas (ABG) is crucial to assess the patient's respiratory status and response to interventions. ABG provides information about oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance, guiding further adjustments in treatment. clinicalPearl: ABGs are essential for managing ARDS and guiding ventilator settings.",
                "administer_antibiotics": "Antibiotics are indicated if the underlying cause of ARDS is infection, such as sepsis secondary to pneumonia, as in this case. However, they do not directly address the respiratory failure caused by ARDS. questionTrap: Antibiotics treat the infection but don't immediately resolve the ARDS.",
                "worsening_ards": "The patient's ABG results demonstrate a worsening hypoxemia (PaO2 of 55 mmHg) and respiratory acidosis (pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg), indicating a deterioration of respiratory function and progression of ARDS. clinicalPearl: Declining ABGs despite interventions indicate worsening ARDS.",
                "improvement": "The patient's condition is not improving. The ABG results clearly indicate worsening respiratory failure. questionTrap: The ABG values contradict any notion of improvement.",
                "respiratory_failure": "The patient's ABG results demonstrate significant hypoxemia (PaO2 of 55 mmHg) and respiratory acidosis (pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg), confirming the presence of acute respiratory failure. mnemonic: Respiratory failure = failing lungs = poor gas exchange.",
                "peptic_ulcer": "Peptic ulcer disease is not directly indicated by the provided ABG results. While stress ulcers can occur in critically ill patients, the ABG mainly reflects respiratory status. questionTrap: Focus on the respiratory data; peptic ulcer is a potential but not immediate concern.",
                "fluid_overload": "While fluid overload can exacerbate respiratory distress, the ABG results primarily reflect respiratory dysfunction (hypoxemia and hypercapnia) rather than fluid volume status. questionTrap: The ABG points to respiratory problems, not primarily fluid overload."
