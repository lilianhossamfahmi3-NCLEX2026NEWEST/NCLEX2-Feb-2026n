            "option_2": "Paresthesia is a sign of nerve compression due to increased pressure, indicating worsening compartment syndrome and a lack of therapeutic response.",
            "option_4": "While a palpable distal pulse is important, an unchanged pulse alone does not necessarily indicate improvement. Other factors like pain level, sensation, and skin color must also improve to signify a therapeutic response."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "Early identification and management of compartment syndrome are crucial to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage. Assess the 6 P's: Pain, Pressure, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, and Paralysis. Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a key early sign.",
        "questionTrap": "The question trap is to focus solely on the presence of a pulse. While a pulse is important, the trend of pain and sensation are more indicative of a therapeutic response in this scenario. Options that focus on a single parameter without considering the overall trend may mislead the test-taker.",
        "mnemonic": "To remember the signs of compartment syndrome, use the mnemonic '6 P's': Pain (out of proportion), Pressure, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis. Remember to assess for trends in these symptoms.",
        "correct": "Decreased pain and improved sensation indicate improved perfusion and nerve function, suggesting a positive response to interventions aimed at reducing compartment pressure."
