    "correctRationale": "A decrease in pain intensity and improved sensation in the affected extremity indicates that the interventions are effective in reducing the pressure within the compartment. This suggests improved blood flow and nerve function.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Increasing pain despite analgesics suggests worsening compartment syndrome and requires immediate intervention, not a therapeutic response.",
      "option_2": "Paresthesia is a sign of nerve compression due to increased pressure, indicating worsening compartment syndrome, not a therapeutic response.",
      "option_4": "While a palpable distal pulse is important, an unchanged pulse does not necessarily indicate improvement. Other factors like pain level and sensation must also improve to signify a therapeutic response."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Early identification and management of compartment syndrome are crucial to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage. Assess the 6 P's: Pain, Pressure, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, and Paralysis. Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a key early sign.",
    "questionTrap": "The question trap is to focus solely on the presence of a pulse. While a pulse is important, the trend of pain and sensation are more indicative of a therapeutic response in this scenario. Options that focus on a single parameter without considering the overall trend may mislead the test-taker.",
    "mnemonic": "To remember the signs of compartment syndrome, use the mnemonic '6 P's': Pain (out of proportion), Pressure, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis. Remember to assess for trends in these symptoms."
