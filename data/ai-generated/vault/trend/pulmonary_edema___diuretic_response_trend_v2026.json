    "correctRationale": "The increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 94% indicates improved gas exchange and is the most direct indicator of a therapeutic response to the interventions (furosemide and oxygen). Furosemide reduces fluid overload in the lungs, facilitating better oxygenation.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "While a decreased respiratory rate suggests improved respiratory effort, it is a less direct indicator of improved gas exchange than oxygen saturation. The patient could be breathing slower but still not oxygenating well.",
      "option_3": "Increased crackles indicate worsening pulmonary edema, suggesting the interventions are not effective and the patient's condition is deteriorating.",
      "option_4": "Decreased urine output suggests the diuretic is not effectively removing excess fluid, indicating a lack of therapeutic response. Increased urine output is expected with effective diuretic therapy."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring oxygen saturation is crucial in patients with pulmonary edema. A rising SpO2 level indicates improved gas exchange and a positive response to treatment. Remember to assess the patient holistically, considering vital signs, respiratory effort, and auscultation findings.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to choose decreased respiratory rate as a sign of improvement. However, oxygen saturation provides a more direct and objective measure of improved oxygenation in response to treatment. Always prioritize oxygenation status in respiratory distress.",
    "mnemonic": "Use 'L-O-U-D' to remember key assessments in pulmonary edema: Lungs (auscultation), Oxygen saturation, Urine output, Daily weight. Improvement in oxygen saturation is a primary indicator of therapeutic response.",
    "correct": "The correct answer is option 1. Increased oxygen saturation from 88% to 94% indicates improved gas exchange in the lungs, signifying a positive response to the diuretic and oxygen therapy. The furosemide is helping to remove excess fluid in the lungs, which improves oxygenation."
