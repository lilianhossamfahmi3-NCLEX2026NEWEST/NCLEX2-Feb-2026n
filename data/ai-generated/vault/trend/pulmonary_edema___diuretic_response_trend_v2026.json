    "correctRationale": "Increased oxygen saturation from 88% to 94% indicates improved gas exchange in the lungs, signifying a positive response to the diuretic and oxygen therapy. The Lasix is helping to remove excess fluid in the lungs, which improves oxygenation.",

      "option_2": "While a decreased respiratory rate is a positive sign, it's less direct an indicator of improved gas exchange than the SpO2.",
      "option_3": "Increased crackles indicate a worsening of pulmonary edema, which would suggest the interventions are not effective.",
      "option_4": "Decreased urine output suggests the diuretic is not working effectively to remove excess fluid, indicating a lack of therapeutic response."

    "mnemonic": "Use 'ABCD' - Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Diuresis - to remember the priorities in managing pulmonary edema. Improvement in 'Breathing' (oxygenation) is the key to assessing therapeutic response."
