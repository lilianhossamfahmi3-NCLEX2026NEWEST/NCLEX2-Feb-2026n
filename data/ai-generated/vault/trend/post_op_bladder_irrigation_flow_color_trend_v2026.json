            "Stable urine output with consistent bright red urine and clots suggests ongoing bleeding and inadequate clot removal. The CBI may need adjustment or further evaluation for complications.",
            "Decreased urine output with clear, colorless urine may indicate over-irrigation or a potential bladder perforation if not correlated with a decreased irrigation rate. The sudden absence of blood requires further assessment to rule out complications."
        ],
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring urine output and color after CBI is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the intervention and detecting potential complications such as hemorrhage or clot retention. A therapeutic response is indicated by increased output and a lightening of urine color.",
        "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly associate decreased urine output with a positive outcome, assuming it indicates the bleeding has stopped. However, in the context of CBI, decreased output is more likely a sign of obstruction or inadequate irrigation.",
        "mnemonic": "Think 'Pink is Progress': Light pink urine indicates progress in clearing blood from the bladder during irrigation.",
        "correct": "The correct answer demonstrates the expected therapeutic response to continuous bladder irrigation, which is increased urine output and a lightening of urine color as blood and clots are cleared."
