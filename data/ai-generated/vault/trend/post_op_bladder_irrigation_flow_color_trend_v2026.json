    "correctRationale": "Increased urine output with a transition from dark red to light pink indicates that the bladder irrigation is effectively clearing blood and clots, thus promoting healing and preventing obstruction. The increased output suggests the irrigation is working to evacuate the bladder.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "Decreased urine output with persistent dark red color suggests continued bleeding and potential clot formation, indicating the irrigation is not effectively clearing the bladder.",
      "Stable urine output with consistent bright red color and clots suggests ongoing bleeding and inadequate clot removal, indicating the irrigation is not effectively managing the bleeding.",
      "Decreased urine output with clear, colorless urine may indicate over-irrigation or a potential bladder perforation if not correlated with decreased irrigation rate, and the sudden absence of blood is not necessarily a positive sign without further assessment."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Monitoring urine output and color after bladder irrigation is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the intervention and detecting potential complications such as hemorrhage or clot retention. A therapeutic response is indicated by increased output and a lightening of urine color.",
    "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to choose decreased urine output if they don't fully understand the goal of bladder irrigation (to remove clots and blood). They might misinterpret decreased output as a sign of the bleeding stopping, but in this case, it is more likely a sign of obstruction.",
    "mnemonic": "Think 'Pink is Progress': Light pink urine indicates progress in clearing blood from the bladder during irrigation.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
