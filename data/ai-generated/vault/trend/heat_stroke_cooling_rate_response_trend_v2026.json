    "correctRationale": "A decreased heart rate indicates that the body is responding to cooling measures and the cardiovascular system is stabilizing. This is a positive therapeutic response.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "Increased respiratory rate suggests the patient is still compensating for the heat stress and is not a sign of therapeutic response. It could indicate developing respiratory distress.",
      "Pupil constriction can be influenced by medications (e.g., chlorpromazine) or neurological changes and is not a primary indicator of heat stroke resolution. The baseline pupil size is not known.",
      "Decreased blood pressure, especially in the context of heat stroke, can indicate worsening dehydration or shock, not a therapeutic response. The patient may require further fluid resuscitation."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "The primary goal in heat stroke management is to rapidly reduce the core body temperature to prevent organ damage. Monitoring vital signs trends is crucial to assess the effectiveness of cooling interventions. Heart rate should decrease as the body cools and the cardiovascular system stabilizes.",
    "questionTrap": "Many students may focus on temperature alone but temperature lags behind heart rate changes. Also, some students may assume BP is supposed to increase in a healthy patient, but the patient is trending toward HYPOtension.",

    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
