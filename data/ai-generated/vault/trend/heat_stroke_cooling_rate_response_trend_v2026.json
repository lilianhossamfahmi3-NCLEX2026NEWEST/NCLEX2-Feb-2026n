        "correctRationale": "A decreased heart rate from 130 bpm to 110 bpm indicates that the body is responding to cooling measures and the cardiovascular system is stabilizing. This is a positive therapeutic response as the body's demand for cardiac output decreases with cooling.",
        "incorrectRationales": [
            "Increased respiratory rate from 24 breaths/min to 28 breaths/min suggests the patient is still compensating for the heat stress and is not a sign of therapeutic response. It could indicate developing respiratory distress or continued metabolic demand.",
            "Pupil constriction from 6 mm to 4 mm can be influenced by medications (e.g., chlorpromazine) or neurological changes and is not a primary indicator of heat stroke resolution. The baseline pupil size prior to the incident is not known, making this an unreliable indicator of improvement.",
            "Decreased blood pressure from 100/60 mmHg to 90/50 mmHg, especially in the context of heat stroke, can indicate worsening dehydration or shock, not a therapeutic response. The patient may require further fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate perfusion."
        ],
        "clinicalPearls": "The primary goal in heat stroke management is to rapidly reduce the core body temperature to prevent organ damage. Monitoring vital signs trends, especially heart rate and blood pressure, is crucial to assess the effectiveness of cooling interventions. Heart rate should decrease as the body cools and the cardiovascular system stabilizes. Hypotension should be addressed with fluid resuscitation.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students may focus solely on temperature changes, which can lag behind heart rate changes. Some students may incorrectly assume that blood pressure should increase in a healthy patient, failing to recognize that the patient is trending toward hypotension, which is concerning in heat stroke.",
