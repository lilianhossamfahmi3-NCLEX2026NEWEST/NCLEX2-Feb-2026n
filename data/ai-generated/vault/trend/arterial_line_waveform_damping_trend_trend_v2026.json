    "correctRationale": "Improved clarity and sharpness of the arterial waveform indicates that damping is resolving and the arterial line is providing more accurate readings. This suggests that interventions to address the damping have been effective. A clear waveform is essential for accurate hemodynamic monitoring and clinical decision-making.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "Decreasing systolic blood pressure, while potentially a positive trend, is not the *most direct* indicator of resolving arterial line damping. It could be due to other factors unrelated to the damping issue.",
      "Narrowing pulse pressure may indicate improved vascular tone, but is not the primary indicator of arterial line damping resolution. A damped arterial line can artificially widen the pulse pressure, so a narrowing pulse pressure could be a secondary effect or unrelated.",
      "Increased heart rate is generally not a desirable outcome and does not indicate a therapeutic response in the context of resolving arterial line damping. It may indicate worsening condition or a compensatory mechanism. It's important to consider the overall clinical picture."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Arterial line damping can lead to inaccurate blood pressure readings, particularly overestimation of systolic pressure. Troubleshooting steps include checking the pressure bag, flushing the line, and ensuring the catheter is not kinked. A clear waveform is essential for accurate hemodynamic monitoring and guiding interventions.",
    "questionTrap": "Students might focus on the changes in blood pressure and heart rate, overlooking the importance of the arterial waveform itself as the *most direct* indicator of resolving damping. The question specifically asks about the therapeutic response *related to the damping issue*.",
    "mnemonic": "WAVEform Clarity: When Assessing Vascular Effectiveness, focus on the WAVEform's Clarity.",
    "correct": "The correct answer is 'Improved clarity and sharpness of the arterial waveform' because it directly reflects the resolution of the arterial line damping, indicating the interventions were effective in restoring accurate pressure readings."
