    "correctRationale": "A decreased CIWA score indicates a reduction in the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, demonstrating a positive response to the interventions. A CIWA score decreasing from 18 to 12 over the course of three hours is a clear clinical improvement.",
    "incorrectRationales": [
      "An increased heart rate is indicative of worsening withdrawal or inadequate treatment.",
      "Increased auditory hallucinations indicate a worsening of the withdrawal state and a lack of therapeutic effect.",
      "An increase in blood pressure suggests that the patient's withdrawal symptoms are not being adequately controlled."
    ],
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "CIWA scores are used to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal and guide treatment decisions.",
      "A decrease in CIWA score indicates a positive response to interventions, while an increase indicates worsening withdrawal.",
      "Vital signs, particularly heart rate and blood pressure, are important indicators of alcohol withdrawal severity."
    ],
    "questionTrap": "Students may select increasing vital signs, misinterpreting them as a sign of the body 'recovering' when actually the opposite is true. The key is to look for a DECREASE in the CIWA score showing improvement.",
