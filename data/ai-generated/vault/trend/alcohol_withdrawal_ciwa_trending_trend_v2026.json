            "An increased heart rate is indicative of worsening withdrawal symptoms or inadequate treatment. The goal of treatment is to stabilize vital signs, not elevate them.",

            "An increase in blood pressure suggests that the patient's withdrawal symptoms are not being adequately controlled. Elevated blood pressure is a sign of continued sympathetic nervous system activation due to withdrawal."

            "CIWA scores are a standardized tool used to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal and guide treatment decisions.",
            "A decrease in CIWA score indicates a positive response to interventions, while an increase or lack of change may indicate the need for further intervention.",

        "questionTrap": "Students may incorrectly focus on the increasing vital signs, misinterpreting them as a sign of the body 'recovering' when, in the context of alcohol withdrawal, they indicate worsening symptoms. The key is to recognize that a DECREASE in the CIWA score demonstrates improvement in the patient's condition.",
        "mnemonic": "CIWA-Ar stands for Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised. Remember: Lower is better! A lower score indicates fewer withdrawal symptoms.",
        "correct": "The decreasing CIWA score indicates a therapeutic response to the administered lorazepam, reflecting a reduction in withdrawal symptoms."
