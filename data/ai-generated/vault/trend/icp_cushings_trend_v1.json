In this scenario, the pulse pressure increases from 40 mmHg (120-80) to 114 mmHg (178-64). This widening occurs as the body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of rising ICP. The increased systolic pressure is a compensatory mechanism to force blood into the brain. Diastolic pressure may remain stable or decrease.",

Possible Cushing's Triad.\nRecommendation: STAT neurological assessment and notify the provider immediately. Prepare for potential interventions to reduce ICP, such as osmotic diuretics or possible surgical intervention. Monitor vital signs closely every 15 minutes."
