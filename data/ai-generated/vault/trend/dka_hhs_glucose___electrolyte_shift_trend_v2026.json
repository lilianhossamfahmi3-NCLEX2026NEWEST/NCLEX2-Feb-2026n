    "correctRationale": "In DKA, the primary goal of treatment is to reduce the elevated blood glucose levels. A decrease in blood glucose from 450 mg/dL to 300 mg/dL indicates that the insulin therapy is effectively lowering the blood glucose, demonstrating a therapeutic response to the interventions. While other parameters are important, glucose control is paramount.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "While an increase in serum potassium from 3.0 mEq/L to 3.8 mEq/L is a positive trend and addresses hypokalemia often associated with insulin therapy in DKA, it is a secondary goal. The primary focus is on reducing blood glucose levels. Potassium repletion is crucial, but glucose reduction is the more immediate indicator of therapeutic response.",
      "option_3": "An increase in arterial pH from 7.25 to 7.35 indicates improvement in acid-base balance, which is a positive sign in DKA treatment. However, the glucose reduction is a more direct and immediate indicator of the effectiveness of the insulin therapy. The pH will improve as the underlying cause (hyperglycemia and ketone production) is addressed.",
      "option_4": "A decrease in urine output from 150 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr could indicate improved hydration status, but it could also be a sign of renal complications or inadequate fluid replacement. It is not the BEST indicator of therapeutic response in the acute management of DKA. Glucose reduction is a more reliable indicator."

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In DKA, the primary goal is to reduce blood glucose levels while correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances.",
      "Monitor blood glucose, electrolytes, and acid-base balance closely during DKA treatment.",
      "Potassium replacement is crucial during insulin therapy to prevent hypokalemia.",
      "Assess urine output to evaluate hydration status and kidney function, but consider it in conjunction with other clinical parameters."
    ],
    "questionTrap": "Students may be tempted to select the electrolyte or pH improvement, as these are also important in DKA management. However, the KEY to DKA/HHS is always the GLUCOSE MANAGEMENT. That is the #1 priority in the acute phase.",
