    "correctRationale": "A decrease in blood glucose from 450 mg/dL to 300 mg/dL indicates that the insulin therapy is effectively lowering the blood glucose levels, which is the primary goal in treating DKA. This demonstrates a therapeutic response to the interventions.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_2": "While an increase in serum potassium from 3.0 mEq/L to 3.8 mEq/L is a positive trend, it is a secondary goal in DKA treatment. The primary focus is on reducing blood glucose levels. Potassium repletion is important to prevent hypokalemia, a common complication of insulin therapy, but the glucose reduction is the more immediate indicator of therapeutic response.",
      "option_3": "An increase in arterial pH from 7.25 to 7.35 indicates improvement in acid-base balance, but the glucose reduction is a more direct indicator of the effectiveness of the insulin therapy. The pH will improve as the underlying cause (hyperglycemia and ketone production) is addressed.",
      "option_4": "A decrease in urine output from 150 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr may indicate improved hydration status, but it can also be a sign of renal complications. The glucose reduction is a more reliable indicator of therapeutic response in the acute management of DKA."
