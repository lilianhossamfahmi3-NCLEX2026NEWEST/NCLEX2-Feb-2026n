The body attempts to compensate for blood loss by increasing heart rate to maintain cardiac output.

The body's initial response is to activate the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in increased heart rate and vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. As blood loss continues, compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed, leading to a drop in blood pressure. The decrease in hemoglobin directly reflects the loss of red blood cells and oxygen-carrying capacity, contributing to tissue hypoxia. This cascade of events, if left unaddressed, can progress to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.",

By 22:00, HR increased to 122 bpm, BP decreased to 90/50 mmHg, and Hgb decreased to 8.4 g/dL. The trend indicates worsening hypovolemia.\nRecommendation: STAT notify the surgeon of these changes. Prepare for potential blood transfusion and continue to closely monitor vital signs, assess surgical site, and evaluate for other signs of bleeding. Consider ordering a STAT CBC and coagulation studies."
