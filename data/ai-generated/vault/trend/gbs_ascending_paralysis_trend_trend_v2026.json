        "correctRationale": "The increase in oxygen saturation from 92% to 98% indicates that the oxygen therapy is effective in improving the client's respiratory status, demonstrating a therapeutic response. GBS can affect respiratory muscles, so improved oxygenation is a key indicator of improvement.",
        "incorrectRationales": {
            "option_1": "While a decreased heart rate is generally a positive sign, in the context of GBS and potential autonomic dysfunction, it is less indicative of a direct therapeutic response to the interventions than the oxygen saturation. The heart rate change could be due to various factors and requires further assessment.",
            "option_3": "Decreased sensation in the lower extremities would indicate worsening of the paralysis, not a therapeutic response. GBS is characterized by ascending paralysis, so a decrease in sensation would be a negative finding.",
            "option_4": "Increased difficulty swallowing would indicate worsening bulbar involvement, which is a negative trend in GBS, not a therapeutic response. This could indicate cranial nerve involvement and potential aspiration risk."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "In GBS, monitor for ascending paralysis and respiratory compromise. Interventions such as oxygen therapy and IVIG are aimed at supporting respiratory function and modulating the immune response. Trends in vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. Early recognition and intervention are essential to prevent respiratory failure.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students might focus on the heart rate decrease, but the primary concern in GBS is respiratory compromise, making oxygen saturation the more critical indicator of therapeutic response. The question requires prioritizing respiratory status in the context of GBS.",
        "mnemonic": "GBS: Guard Breathing Status. Oxygen saturation is key to assessing treatment effectiveness.",
        "correct": "The client's oxygen saturation improved from 92% to 98% after oxygen therapy was initiated. This indicates that the intervention was effective in improving the client's respiratory status, which is a primary concern in GBS."
