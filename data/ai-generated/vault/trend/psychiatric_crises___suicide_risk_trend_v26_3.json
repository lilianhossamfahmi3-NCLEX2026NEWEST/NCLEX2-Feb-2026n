B: Patient has a history of major depressive disorder, diagnosed 5 years ago, and has been non-compliant with his SSRI medication for the past 3 months. He reports significant stress related to job loss and relationship issues. A: Patient is currently alert and oriented, but expresses feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. He is tearful and withdrawn. Acetaminophen levels are pending. He denies current suicidal ideation but admits to having a plan earlier today. He is medically stable at this time. R: I recommend continuous monitoring for suicidal ideation and potential self-harm. Obtain a psychiatric consult for evaluation and medication management. Implement suicide precautions immediately. Continue to monitor acetaminophen levels and manage medically as needed.",
