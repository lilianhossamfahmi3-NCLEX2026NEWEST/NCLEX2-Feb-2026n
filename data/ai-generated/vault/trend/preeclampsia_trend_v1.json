    "correct": "The client's data indicates a progression towards severe preeclampsia, with a blood pressure of 166/112 mmHg, 4+ reflexes with clonus, and 3+ proteinuria. These findings suggest imminent risk of an eclamptic seizure. Eclampsia is characterized by seizures in a woman with preeclampsia, resulting from cerebral vasospasm, edema, and hemorrhage. The hyperreflexia and clonus indicate increased central nervous system irritability, making a seizure the most immediate threat.",
    "incorrect": "Postpartum hemorrhage, while a potential complication after delivery, is not the most immediate risk based on the presented data. Gestational diabetes is unrelated to the presented symptoms of preeclampsia. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix and is not directly related to the client's current presentation of worsening preeclampsia.",
