            "option_1": "Increased restlessness and agitation are signs of worsening ICP or inadequate cerebral perfusion, not a therapeutic response.",
            "option_3": "An increased heart rate can be a compensatory mechanism in response to increased ICP or other physiological stressors. It does not directly indicate a therapeutic response to interventions aimed at reducing ICP.",
            "option_4": "An increased systolic blood pressure can be a component of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), which is a late sign of increased ICP and indicates worsening neurological status, not a therapeutic response."
