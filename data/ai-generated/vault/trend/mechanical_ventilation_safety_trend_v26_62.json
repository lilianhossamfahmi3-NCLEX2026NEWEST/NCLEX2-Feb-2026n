        "questionStem": "Click on the sequence of actions the nurse should take. Each action can only be used once.",
        "correctRationale": "The patient's high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and recent desaturation indicate a potential airway obstruction or decreased lung compliance. The nurse's initial actions should focus on quickly assessing and addressing the most life-threatening possibilities. First, the nurse should auscultate the patient's breath sounds to determine if breath sounds are equal bilaterally. Unequal or absent breath sounds may point to pneumothorax, endotracheal tube displacement, or mucus plugging. Second, after assessing breath sounds, the nurse should suction the patient's airway to remove any secretions that may be causing airway obstruction. This directly addresses a common cause of increased PIP. Finally, the nurse should notify the respiratory therapist. They can assess ventilator settings and provide advanced interventions if the problem persists or escalates. Increasing FiO2 and administering a bronchodilator are not first-line interventions. Obtaining a chest x-ray delays immediate treatment.",
        "rationaleOptions": {
            "optionA": "Auscultating the breath sounds helps determine the presence and location of adequate air movement and potential obstructions or pneumothorax, guiding further interventions. Clinical Pearl: Assess for unilateral absence of breath sounds, suggesting pneumothorax or tube displacement.",
            "optionB": "Suctioning the airway removes potential obstructions like mucus plugs, which can significantly increase PIP and cause desaturation. Clinical Pearl: Pre-oxygenate before suctioning to prevent further desaturation.",
            "optionC": "Notifying the respiratory therapist allows for a comprehensive evaluation of ventilator settings and potential adjustments or advanced interventions. Clinical Pearl: RT can assess auto-PEEP and adjust ventilator parameters.",
            "optionD": "Increasing the FiO2 temporarily addresses the desaturation but does not solve the underlying problem causing the high PIP. Question Trap: Increasing FiO2 alone masks the problem and delays necessary interventions.",
            "optionE": "Administering a bronchodilator may address bronchospasm but is not the priority intervention for high PIP and acute desaturation. Question Trap: Bronchodilators are useful for wheezing, but not the primary intervention for acute airway obstruction.",
            "optionF": "Obtaining a chest X-ray is important for further evaluation but delays immediate interventions to address the patient's acute distress. Question Trap: Chest X-ray is important, but immediate interventions are needed first."

Pneumothorax reduces lung volume and increases resistance to ventilation. Endotracheal tube displacement can lead to ventilation of only one lung or the esophagus, resulting in hypoxemia and increased airway resistance. Mucus plugs obstruct the airway, increasing resistance and causing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Mnemonic: DOPE (Displacement, Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment).",

He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Current ventilator settings are: FiO2 50%, tidal volume 450 mL, PEEP 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate 16. He received Albuterol/Ipratropium nebulizer at 14:00.\n\nAssessment: Patient is restless and appears to be in mild respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in the right upper lobe. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR (ventilator set) 16, SpO2 88%, Temp 37.2°C. PIP 38 cm H2O.
