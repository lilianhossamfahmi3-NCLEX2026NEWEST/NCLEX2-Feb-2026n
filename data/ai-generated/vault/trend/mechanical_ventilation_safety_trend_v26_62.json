    "questionStem": "Click on the sequence of actions the nurse should take. Each action can only be used once.",
    "correctRationale": "The patient's high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and recent desaturation indicate a potential airway obstruction or decreased lung compliance. The nurse's initial actions should focus on quickly assessing and addressing the most life-threatening possibilities. First, the nurse should auscultate the patient's breath sounds to determine if breath sounds are equal bilaterally. Unequal or absent breath sounds may point to pneumothorax, endotracheal tube displacement, or mucus plugging. Second, after assessing breath sounds, the nurse should suction the patient's airway to remove any secretions that may be causing airway obstruction. This directly addresses a common cause of increased PIP. Finally, the nurse should notify the respiratory therapist. They can assess ventilator settings and provide advanced interventions if the problem persists or escalates.",

      "optionA": "Auscultating the breath sounds helps determine the presence and location of adequate air movement and potential obstructions or pneumothorax, guiding further interventions.",

Pneumothorax reduces lung volume and increases resistance to ventilation. Endotracheal tube displacement can lead to ventilation of only one lung or the esophagus, resulting in hypoxemia and increased airway resistance. Mucus plugs obstruct the airway, increasing resistance and causing ventilation/perfusion mismatch.",

Over the last hour, his peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 to 38 cm H2O, and his SpO2 dropped from 94% to 88%.\n\nBackground: Mr. Jones was intubated yesterday due to increasing respiratory distress. He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Current ventilator settings are: FiO2 50%, tidal volume 450 mL, PEEP 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate 16.\n\nAssessment: Patient is restless and appears to be in mild respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in the right upper lobe. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR (ventilator set) 16, SpO2 88%, Temp 37.2°C. PIP 38 cm H2O. ABG from this morning: pH 7.35, PaCO2 55, PaO2 70, HCO3 28.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend assessing for possible pneumothorax, endotracheal tube displacement, or mucus plugging. Consider suctioning the airway and notifying respiratory therapy for further evaluation of ventilator settings. We should also obtain a chest X-ray if the problem persists.",
