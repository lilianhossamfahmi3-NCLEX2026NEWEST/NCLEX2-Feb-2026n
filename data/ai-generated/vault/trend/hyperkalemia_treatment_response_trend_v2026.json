            "option_1": "Increasing T wave amplitude indicates worsening hyperkalemia, not a therapeutic response. T wave changes are a key ECG manifestation of hyperkalemia, and an increase suggests the condition is deteriorating.",

            "option_4": "While a decreasing heart rate can be a positive sign in some contexts, the presence of persistent peaked T waves indicates that hyperkalemia is still affecting the heart. The potassium level itself needs to decrease for a true therapeutic response."
