      "option_4": "While a decreasing heart rate can be a positive sign in some contexts, the presence of peaked T waves indicates that hyperkalemia is still affecting the heart, negating the potential benefit of the heart rate change. The potassium level itself needs to decrease for a true therapeutic response."
