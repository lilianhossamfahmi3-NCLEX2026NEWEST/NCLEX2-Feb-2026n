      "option_2": "An increase in lithium level to 1.2 mEq/L, without knowing the target therapeutic range for *this* client, doesn't necessarily indicate a therapeutic response. A key detail is that the level remained at 0.8. Furthermore, levels can rise too fast, leading to toxicity. In this case, the level remained stable.",
      "option_4": "Increased nausea suggests an adverse effect of lithium, not a therapeutic response. While mild nausea can be expected, worsening nausea is not desirable."

Educate the patient about maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding activities that could lead to dehydration, as dehydration can increase lithium levels.  Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial to ensure therapeutic effectiveness and prevent toxicity.",
