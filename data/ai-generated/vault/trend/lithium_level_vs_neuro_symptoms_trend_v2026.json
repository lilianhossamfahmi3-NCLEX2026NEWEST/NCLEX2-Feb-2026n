    "correctRationale": "A decrease in hand tremors indicates a positive *initial* response to lithium therapy, suggesting the medication is starting to stabilize the client's mood without causing significant adverse effects. It's important to note that the lithium level is still sub-therapeutic, but a reduction in symptoms is a positive sign.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Increased muscle rigidity is a concerning sign, potentially indicating lithium toxicity or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This would not be a therapeutic response and requires immediate assessment.",
      "option_2": "A slight increase in lithium level from 0.8 mEq/L to 0.9 mEq/L is not clinically significant within this timeframe and does not necessarily indicate a therapeutic response. The level is still sub-therapeutic. The clinical improvement is more important than a minimal lab change.",
      "option_4": "Increased nausea suggests an adverse effect of lithium, not a therapeutic response. While mild nausea can be expected initially, worsening nausea is not desirable and should be addressed."

  "clinicalPearls": "Early signs of lithium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tremors. Educate the patient about maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding activities that could lead to dehydration, as dehydration can increase lithium levels. Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial to ensure therapeutic effectiveness and prevent toxicity. Remember that clinical improvement can precede significant changes in serum levels.",
  "questionTrap": "Students may focus solely on the lithium level and incorrectly assume that any change indicates a therapeutic response, even if the change is minimal or associated with adverse effects. This question requires students to prioritize clinical assessment and differentiate between therapeutic effects and adverse effects, understanding that clinical improvement can occur before therapeutic lithium levels are reached.",
