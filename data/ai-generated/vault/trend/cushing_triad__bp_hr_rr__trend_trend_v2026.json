        "correct": "Option 2 is correct. Cushing's Triad is characterized by increased systolic blood pressure (hypertension), decreased heart rate (bradycardia), and irregular respiratory rate, indicating increased intracranial pressure (ICP). A therapeutic response to interventions aimed at reducing ICP would be indicated by a decrease in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as the intracranial pressure decreases. The vital signs in the table show a trend of decreasing systolic blood pressure and increasing heart rate from 0800 to 1100, suggesting a positive response to the mannitol administration. This indicates that the medication is effectively reducing the ICP, leading to improved vital signs.",
        "incorrect": {
            "option_1": "This option suggests a worsening of Cushing's Triad, not a therapeutic response. Increased systolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate are indicative of increasing intracranial pressure, suggesting that the interventions are not effective and the patient's condition is deteriorating.",
            "option_3": "While a decreased systolic blood pressure is a positive sign, an increased respiratory rate alone is not the most reliable indicator of improvement in Cushing's Triad. The heart rate must also be considered. In this scenario, the respiratory rate is increasing, which can be a positive trend, but the primary indicators of improvement are the blood pressure and heart rate. This option does not fully represent the expected therapeutic response.",
            "option_4": "While decreased respiratory rate and decreased systolic blood pressure could indicate improvement in some conditions, in the context of Cushing's Triad, the heart rate must also be considered. This combination alone does not definitively indicate a therapeutic response to interventions addressing increased intracranial pressure. The heart rate should be increasing as the ICP decreases."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "Cushing's Triad is a late and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure and requires immediate intervention. Recognizing trends in vital signs is crucial for effective patient management. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce ICP by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the vascular system, thereby reducing swelling. Monitor serum osmolality during mannitol administration.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students will focus on just one vital sign change instead of analyzing the overall trend of all three vital signs (BP, HR, RR) in the context of Cushing's Triad. Students may also misinterpret the data if they do not understand the expected response to treatment for increased ICP. Look for the overall trend, not just isolated data points.",
        "mnemonic": "Cushing's Triad: Think 'BP up, HR down' as the pressure mounts 'Up' in the brain. Reversal of this trend indicates improvement. Use the mnemonic 'I-PAD' for Increased Pressure = Altered Dynamics (BP, HR, RR)."
