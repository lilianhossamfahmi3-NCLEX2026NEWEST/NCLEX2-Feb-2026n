    "correct": "Option 2 is correct because Cushing's Triad is characterized by increased systolic blood pressure, decreased heart rate, and irregular respiratory rate. A therapeutic response would be indicated by a decrease in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as the intracranial pressure decreases.",

      "option_1": "This option suggests a worsening of Cushing's Triad, not a therapeutic response.",
      "option_3": "An increased respiratory rate is not typically associated with improvement in Cushing's Triad. Decreased systolic blood pressure is a positive sign, but needs to be considered with the other vital signs.",
      "option_4": "While decreased respiratory rate and decreased systolic blood pressure could indicate improvement in some conditions, in the context of Cushing's Triad, the heart rate must also be considered. This combination alone does not definitively indicate a therapeutic response to interventions addressing increased intracranial pressure."
