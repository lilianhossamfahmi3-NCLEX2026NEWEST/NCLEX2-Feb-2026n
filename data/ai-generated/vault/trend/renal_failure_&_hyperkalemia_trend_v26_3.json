      "SBAR": "07:00 Report: Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old male with a history of Stage 4 CKD, HTN, and DM2. He was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for hyperkalemia. \n\nSituation: The patient's potassium level is critically high at 7.2 mEq/L. He is complaining of muscle weakness and nausea.\n\nBackground: His baseline potassium is usually around 5.5 mEq/L due to his CKD. He missed his dialysis appointment yesterday. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin glargine, and sevelamer. EKG shows peaked T waves.\n\nAssessment: Current vital signs are: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 100 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. He has diminished deep tendon reflexes. Urine output is 20 mL/hr. He is alert and oriented but anxious. Stat EKG obtained, showing peaked T waves.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate treatment to lower his potassium levels and prevent cardiac complications. Consider administering calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and possibly sodium polystyrene sulfonate. A stat nephrology consult is also recommended.",
