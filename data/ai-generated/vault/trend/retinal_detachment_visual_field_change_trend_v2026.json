    "correctRationale": "A decrease in the 'curtain-like' visual field defect is the most direct indication of a therapeutic response. This suggests that the retina is reattaching or the detachment is stabilizing, which is the goal of interventions for retinal detachment.",
    "incorrectRationales": {
      "option_1": "Increased floaters and flashing lights indicate worsening of the retinal detachment, as these are common symptoms associated with the initial stages or progression of the condition.",
      "option_3": "Eye pain and headache are not direct indicators of the status of the retinal detachment itself. While pain may be present, it does not reflect whether the retina is reattaching.",
      "option_4": "Increased IOP is not directly related to retinal detachment. Retinal detachment does not typically cause increased IOP. Elevated IOP is more related to glaucoma."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Prompt recognition and treatment of retinal detachment are crucial to prevent permanent vision loss. The 'curtain-like' visual field defect is a classic symptom. Patient education regarding reporting changes in vision is paramount.",
    "questionTrap": "Many students may focus on pain relief as a positive outcome. However, pain relief does not directly indicate the status of the retinal reattachment. The key is to identify the specific symptom directly related to the retinal detachment itself.",
