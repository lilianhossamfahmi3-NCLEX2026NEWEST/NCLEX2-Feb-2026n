While pain may be present, it does not directly reflect whether the retina is reattaching. The vital signs and nurses' notes show a decrease in pain, but this is related to analgesic administration, not necessarily retinal reattachment.",
            "option_4": "Increased IOP is not directly related to retinal detachment. Retinal detachment does not typically cause increased IOP. Elevated IOP is more related to glaucoma. There is no data provided regarding IOP."

The key is to identify the specific symptom directly related to the retinal detachment itself, which is the visual field defect.",
