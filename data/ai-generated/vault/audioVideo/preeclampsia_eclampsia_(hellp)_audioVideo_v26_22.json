She reports a severe headache, blurred vision, and epigastric pain.\n\n**Background:**\nShe has a history of well-controlled hypertension prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure has been elevated over the past two weeks, with proteinuria confirmed at her last prenatal visit. She denies any known allergies. Vital signs were stable upon admission, but she reports increasing discomfort.\n\n**Assessment:**\nAlert and oriented x3. BP 160/110 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.1°C (98.8°F). Urine protein 3+. Deep tendon reflexes 3+ with 2 beats of ankle clonus bilaterally. Complaining of severe headache and epigastric pain. Assessment reveals possible HELLP syndrome.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI recommend stat labs (CBC, CMP, LDH, AST, ALT, uric acid), continuous fetal monitoring, and Magnesium Sulfate 4g IV bolus followed by a 2g/hr maintenance dose. Prepare for possible delivery based on lab results and patient condition. Strict I&O monitoring is essential. Administer Labetalol 20mg IV PRN for SBP >160 mmHg.",

                "Administer Labetalol 20mg IV PRN for SBP >160 mmHg": "Labetalol is an antihypertensive agent used to manage severe hypertension associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Given the client's BP of 160/110 mmHg, this intervention is indicated to prevent complications such as stroke. ClinicalPearl: Labetalol is preferred due to its combined alpha- and beta-blocking effects, providing effective BP control without significantly reducing maternal heart rate.",
                "Prepare for immediate cesarean section": "Given the HELLP syndrome indicators (thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes), gestational age (34 weeks), and uncontrolled blood pressure, immediate delivery is often the most appropriate intervention to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Cesarean section may be necessary depending on maternal and fetal status. ClinicalPearl: Delivery is the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome, especially when maternal or fetal conditions deteriorate rapidly.",
                "Administer Methylergonovine IM": "Methylergonovine is a uterotonic agent used to manage postpartum hemorrhage. It is contraindicated in patients with hypertension as it can further elevate blood pressure. In the context of preeclampsia/eclampsia with elevated BP, it is absolutely contraindicated. QuestionTrap: Students may confuse this with oxytocin, which is safe for postpartum hemorrhage but methylergonovine is not in this case.",
                "Monitor urine output hourly": "Monitoring urine output hourly is crucial to assess renal perfusion and detect oliguria, which can be a sign of worsening preeclampsia or acute kidney injury. This intervention helps in managing fluid balance and preventing complications. ClinicalPearl: Oliguria can indicate worsening renal function and impending renal failure, necessitating prompt intervention.",
                "Administer Furosemide IV": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is generally contraindicated in preeclampsia unless there is evidence of pulmonary edema or heart failure. Diuretics can further reduce intravascular volume and worsen placental perfusion in preeclamptic patients. It is not indicated in this scenario. QuestionTrap: Students may think a diuretic is helpful for hypertension, but in preeclampsia, it can worsen placental perfusion."

While suggestive, it is not a primary diagnostic marker for HELLP syndrome itself. ClinicalPearl: Uric acid levels are often elevated due to decreased renal excretion."
