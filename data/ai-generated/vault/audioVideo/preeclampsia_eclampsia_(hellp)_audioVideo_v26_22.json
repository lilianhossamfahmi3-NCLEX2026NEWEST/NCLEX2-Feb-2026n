      "SBAR": "**Situation:**\nMrs. Emily Carter, a 28-year-old primigravida at 34 weeks gestation, was admitted at 14:00 today for preeclampsia. She reports a severe headache, blurred vision, and epigastric pain. \n\n**Background:**\nShe has a history of well-controlled hypertension prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure has been elevated over the past two weeks, with proteinuria confirmed at her last prenatal visit. No known allergies. Vital signs stable upon admission, but reports increasing discomfort. \n\n**Assessment:**\nAlert and oriented x3. BP 160/110 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.1°C (98.8°F). 3+ protein in urine. Deep tendon reflexes 3+ with 2 beats of ankle clonus bilaterally. Complaining of severe headache and epigastric pain. Assessment reveals possible HELLP syndrome.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI recommend stat labs (CBC, CMP, LDH, AST, ALT, uric acid), continuous fetal monitoring, and Magnesium Sulfate IV bolus followed by a maintenance dose. Prepare for possible delivery based on lab results and patient condition. Strict I&O monitoring is essential.",

          "Prepare for immediate cesarean section": "Given the HELLP syndrome indicators (thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes), gestational age (34 weeks), and uncontrolled blood pressure, immediate delivery is often the most appropriate intervention to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Cesarean section may be necessary depending on maternal and fetal status.",
          "Administer Methylergonovine IM": "Methylergonovine is a uterotonic agent used to manage postpartum hemorrhage. It is contraindicated in patients with hypertension as it can further elevate blood pressure. In the context of preeclampsia/eclampsia with elevated BP, it is absolutely contraindicated.",

Diuretics can further reduce intravascular volume and worsen placental perfusion in preeclamptic patients. It is not indicated in this scenario."
