She is reporting a severe, non-responsive headache, blurred vision, and sharp epigastric pain.\n\nBACKGROUND: The client has a history of chronic hypertension, managed with methyldopa. She lives in a rural area, a 2-hour drive from our facility, which delayed her seeking care. Her prenatal course was unremarkable until 32 weeks when proteinuria and rising blood pressures were noted. No known drug allergies.\n\nASSESSMENT: BP is 174/112 mmHg. She is alert but anxious. Physical exam reveals 3+ deep tendon reflexes with 2 beats of ankle clonus. There is 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Fetal heart rate shows minimal variability. Stat labs confirm hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Continue magnesium sulfate infusion per protocol. Administer IV labetalol for severe-range blood pressures. Notify neonatology and anesthesia, and prepare for imminent delivery via cesarean section. Maintain strict I&O.",
