The plan of care must prioritize interventions that improve ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching, reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and prevent complications.

While the client is hypoxemic, prolonged exposure to high FiO₂ (especially 100%) can cause oxygen toxicity, leading to absorptive atelectasis and further lung injury.

A large fluid bolus would increase hydrostatic pressure and worsen the existing pulmonary edema, further impairing gas exchange. Vasopressors are the appropriate intervention for this type of hypotension."
