Background: Initially, he responded well to treatment, but over the last 12 hours, his condition has deteriorated. He requires increasing FiO2 and PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation. Assessment: His SpO2 is now 88% on FiO2 70% and PEEP of 12 cm H2O. Chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. He is restless and appears to be tiring. Vital signs: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28 (ventilator-assisted), Temp 38.9°C. Recommendation: I recommend considering prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and further evaluation for underlying infection or other complications.
