Chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. He's restless and tiring. Vitals: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28 (ventilator-assisted), Temp 38.9°C.

                "Initiate prone positioning.": "Prone positioning can improve oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing lung perfusion and ventilation, reducing atelectasis, and improving V/Q matching. This is especially beneficial when PaO2 remains low despite high FiO2 and PEEP. Prone positioning shifts perfusion from the posterior (dependent) portions of the lungs to the anterior portions, which are often better ventilated, leading to improved gas exchange. clinicalPearl: Monitor the patient closely for skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, especially on bony prominences.",
                "Administer a neuromuscular blocking agent.": "Neuromuscular blockade can improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator dyssynchrony in severe ARDS. It minimizes patient-ventilator mismatch, reduces oxygen consumption, and facilitates lung-protective ventilation strategies. By paralyzing the patient, the ventilator can deliver breaths more effectively, reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. clinicalPearl: Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia are provided concurrently with neuromuscular blockade to prevent patient distress.",
                "Suction the patient's airway.": "Suctioning removes secretions that can obstruct the airway and impair gas exchange. Given the patient's compromised respiratory status and potential for increased secretions in ARDS, this intervention is crucial to maintain airway patency and optimize ventilation. Removing secretions can also reduce the risk of secondary infections. clinicalPearl: Pre-oxygenate the patient before suctioning to prevent desaturation.",
                "Increase FiO2 to 100%.": "Increasing FiO2 to 100% can lead to oxygen toxicity and further lung injury, especially when maintained for extended periods. It's crucial to use the lowest FiO2 needed to maintain adequate oxygenation. The current FiO2 is already high. questionTrap: Nurses may think that increasing FiO2 is always the answer, but prolonged high FiO2 can cause harm.",
                "Administer a bolus of intravenous fluids.": "The patient's BP is already low. Administering a bolus of intravenous fluids without careful monitoring can worsen pulmonary edema and compromise respiratory function in ARDS. Fluid management should be conservative and guided by hemodynamic parameters. questionTrap: Nurses may think that hypotension always requires fluids, but in ARDS, careful fluid management is key.",
                "Decrease PEEP to 8 cm H2O.": "Decreasing PEEP could cause alveolar collapse and worsen oxygenation. PEEP helps to keep the alveoli open and improve gas exchange. The current PEEP is supporting alveolar recruitment. questionTrap: Nurses may think that decreasing PEEP will help with blood pressure, but it can worsen oxygenation."
