Patient has a history of major depressive disorder and was recently terminated from her job one week ago. EMS administered Narcan en route, initial GCS of 13. Currently, GCS is 15.",
        "background": "Patient has a documented history of major depressive disorder, treated with sertraline 100mg daily, though medication compliance has been inconsistent, particularly since job loss. Previous suicide attempt five years ago involving medication overdose. Family history of depression and suicide.",
        "assessment": "Patient is alert and oriented, but expresses feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and persistent suicidal ideation. Reports feeling overwhelmed by recent life stressors. Vital signs: BP 110/70, HR 92, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.0°C.  Patient demonstrates tearfulness and avoids eye contact.",
        "recommendation": "Continue close observation, initiate suicide precautions, consult with psychiatry for medication review and consider adjustment to current treatment regimen.
