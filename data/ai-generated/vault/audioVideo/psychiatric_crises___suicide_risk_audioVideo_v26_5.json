She has a history of major depressive disorder and was recently terminated from her job one week prior. EMS administered naloxone en route; initial GCS was 13, now 15.",
                "background": "The patient has a documented history of major depressive disorder, treated with sertraline 100mg daily, though medication compliance has been inconsistent, especially since her job loss. She had a previous suicide attempt five years ago involving medication overdose. There is a family history of depression and suicide.",

She reports feeling overwhelmed by recent life stressors. Vital signs: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.0°C. The patient demonstrates tearfulness and avoids eye contact.",

Implement supportive counseling and explore coping strategies to address feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Engage family in treatment planning, if appropriate and with patient consent. Monitor for potential withdrawal symptoms from possible substance use."
