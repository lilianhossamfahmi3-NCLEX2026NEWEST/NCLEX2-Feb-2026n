He presented to the ED today with progressive dyspnea and severe hypoxemia after 5 days of worsening symptoms from pneumonia, which was treated with oral antibiotics at home without success. Blood cultures drawn in the ED are now positive for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. The client lives alone in a rural area, which he stated delayed him from seeking care earlier.\n\nA: Currently sedated and mechanically ventilated. Vitals are trending towards instability. He is hypotensive and tachycardic. SpO2 is 88% on FiO2 60% and PEEP of 10 cm H2O. ABG reveals severe combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Chest x-ray shows classic bilateral diffuse infiltrates. Ventilator peak inspiratory pressures are elevated at 35 cm H2O. Urine output is low at 20 mL/hr.\n\nR: Immediate re-evaluation of lung-protective ventilation strategy is required. Recommend initiating prone positioning protocol and carefully titrating PEEP to improve oxygenation while monitoring for barotrauma. Continue sepsis management per protocol. Maintain hemodynamic stability with vasopressors as ordered."
