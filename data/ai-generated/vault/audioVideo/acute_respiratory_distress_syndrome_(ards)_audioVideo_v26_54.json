He was intubated in the ED and transferred to ICU.\n\nBackground: The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Five days ago, he developed pneumonia and was treated with oral antibiotics at home without improvement. He was admitted today with increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia. Blood cultures are positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\nAssessment: The patient is sedated and mechanically ventilated. Vital signs: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 24 (ventilator), SpO2 88% on FiO2 60%, PEEP 10. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58, HCO3 24. Chest X-ray shows bilateral diffuse infiltrates. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O. Urine output is 20 mL/hr.\n\nRecommendation: Continue current ventilator settings. Obtain a repeat ABG in one hour. Consider increasing PEEP if oxygenation does not improve. Monitor for signs of barotrauma. Assess fluid balance and consider a fluid bolus if hypotension persists. Obtain a sputum culture. Consider proning the patient.",
