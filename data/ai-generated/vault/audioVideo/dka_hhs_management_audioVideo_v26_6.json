Initial interventions should focus on rapid rehydration with isotonic fluids (0.9% NS) to restore intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, are common due to osmotic diuresis and insulin administration. Frequent monitoring and replacement of potassium are essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Insulin therapy is initiated to gradually reduce blood glucose levels, but it should be administered cautiously to avoid rapid glucose decline and prevent cerebral edema. Neurological assessments are crucial to monitor for changes in mental status and signs of cerebral edema, which can occur with rapid fluid shifts. The priority actions in this case are addressing hypovolemia with fluid administration, correcting electrolyte imbalances through monitoring and replacement, and controlling hyperglycemia with insulin infusion. These actions lead to improved hydration, normalized electrolyte balance, and controlled blood glucose levels, ultimately stabilizing the client's condition.",
