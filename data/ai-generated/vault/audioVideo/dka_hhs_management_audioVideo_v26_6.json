Emergency Medical Services reported a bedside glucose level greater than 600 mg/dL.\nA: Client is lethargic, arousable only to painful stimuli (GCS 11). Mucous membranes are dry and skin turgor is poor. Respirations are rapid and shallow at 32/min. Tachycardia is present with a heart rate of 120 bpm. Blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg. An 18-gauge IV catheter was established in the left antecubital fossa.\nR: Initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation per protocol. Obtain STAT comprehensive metabolic panel and serum osmolality.

The client's potassium is critically low at 3.0 mEq/L. Administering insulin would drive potassium into the cells, worsening the hypokalemia and risking fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, administering potassium and continuing to monitor it are immediate priorities. Due to the extreme hyperosmolality (340 mOsm/kg), there is a high risk of cerebral edema as fluids shift during treatment. Frequent neurological assessments are essential to detect early changes.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options either violate safety principles or are a lower priority. Administering hypotonic saline (0.45% NS) is contraindicated initially as it can lower serum osmolality too quickly, increasing the risk of cerebral edema. An insulin bolus is also dangerous for the same reason; it causes a precipitous drop in blood glucose and osmolality. While elevating the head of the bed is a good general practice, 30 degrees is the standard to prevent aspiration and reduce intracranial pressure, making 15 degrees suboptimal and a lower priority than life-sustaining electrolyte correction and neurological monitoring.",
