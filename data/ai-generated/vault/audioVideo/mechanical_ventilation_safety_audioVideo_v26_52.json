        "situation": "14:00: John Smith, 68-year-old male, admitted for COPD exacerbation. Intubated and mechanically ventilated since 08:00 due to increasing respiratory distress and hypercapnia. Current settings: FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Rate 16 breaths/min. Patient is on continuous sedation with propofol.",
        "background": "History of COPD, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Smoker for 50 years, quit 5 years ago. Allergies: Penicillin (rash). Home medications: Albuterol inhaler PRN, Lisinopril 20 mg daily, Aspirin 81 mg daily. Admitted with increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and productive cough. Initial ABG showed pH 7.28, PaCO2 65 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg on room air.",
        "assessment": "14:00: Patient is sedated but responsive to painful stimuli. Vital signs: HR 110 bpm, BP 150/90 mmHg, RR 16 (ventilator), SpO2 92%. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. ETCO2 trending upward. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O and trending upward. Plateau pressure is 28 cm H2O. Nurse noticed increased agitation despite sedation. The high pressure alarm is sounding intermittently.",
        "recommendation": "I recommend assessing for possible causes of increased airway resistance, such as secretions, bronchospasm, or pneumothorax. Consider suctioning the patient and obtaining a stat chest X-ray. I also recommend consulting respiratory therapy for possible ventilator adjustments and consider arterial blood gas (ABG) to evaluate ventilation and oxygenation."

Potential causes include increased secretions, bronchospasm, and pneumothorax. The immediate priority is to address the most likely and easily treatable cause: airway obstruction from secretions. Suctioning the airway is the first step to clear secretions and reduce airway resistance. Auscultating lung sounds after suctioning assesses the effectiveness of the intervention and helps identify any persistent issues, such as bronchospasm (indicated by wheezing). A chest X-ray is indicated to rule out pneumothorax but is not the immediate priority. Increasing sedation may be necessary if the patient is agitated, but only after addressing potential physiological causes of the increased airway resistance. Decreasing PEEP is generally not indicated in this scenario, as it could lead to alveolar collapse and worsening oxygenation.",
