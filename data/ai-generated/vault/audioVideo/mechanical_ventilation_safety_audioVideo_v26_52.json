Lives alone in a second-floor apartment with no elevator, reports difficulty with ADLs due to breathlessness. Initial ABG on 6L NC showed acute respiratory acidosis.\nA: Client became increasingly lethargic with shallow respirations. Decision made for elective intubation to manage hypercapnic respiratory failure and decrease work of breathing. Client intubated with 8.0 ETT, secured at 23 cm at the lip. Placed on AC ventilation. Sedation initiated with propofol.\nR: Continue ventilator support and sedation. Monitor hemodynamics and respiratory status closely. Obtain post-intubation chest x-ray to confirm placement.

The nurse must analyze all available cues to form a complete clinical picture. The presence of coarse crackles, wheezing, agitation, and rising peak pressures strongly suggests obstruction from secretions, bronchospasm, and client-ventilator asynchrony. A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening complication of positive pressure ventilation and must be considered a primary hypothesis given the acute deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options represent either clinically unsupported hypotheses or conditions that would cause a different type of alarm. While kinked tubing is a possible cause of a high-pressure alarm, there is no evidence in the client's record to support this; it is an assessment to be performed, not a finding from the chart. Low cuff pressure would cause an air leak, triggering a low-pressure alarm, not a high-pressure alarm.",
