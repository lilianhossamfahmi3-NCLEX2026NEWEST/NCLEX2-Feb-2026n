His blood pressure remains elevated despite medication.\n\n**BACKGROUND:** Admitted yesterday for management of poorly controlled hypertension. He has expressed concerns about medication costs, which has led to intermittent non-adherence, a key social determinant affecting his health. His home medications, lisinopril and amlodipine, were administered last night.\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Current BP is 160/90 mmHg, HR 78/min, SpO2 98% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals a distinct, low-pitched S4 gallop at the apex, best heard with the bell. This finding was not documented on admission. Lungs are clear bilaterally, and there is no peripheral edema. The client is alert and oriented.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Notify the provider of the persistent hypertension and the newly identified S4 heart sound. Suggest an echocardiogram to assess for left ventricular hypertrophy. Continue scheduled antihypertensives and monitor BP q4h. Reinforce education on medication adherence and explore resources for financial assistance."

His medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. He lives alone in a third-floor apartment without an elevator, which presents a significant barrier to mobility and accessing fresh food. On admission, he presented with 2+ pitting edema in his lower extremities and bibasilar crackles. His initial B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) was 1250 pg/mL. He was initiated on IV furosemide and has since been transitioned to oral diuretics this morning. \n\nProgress Note (Today 11:00): \nS: The client reports a sudden increase in shortness of breath over the past hour. \nB: He received his scheduled oral furosemide at 08:00. His morning weight was up 1 lb from yesterday. \nA: Respiratory rate is 28/min, SpO2 has dropped to 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals new-onset fine crackles throughout the lower and mid-lung fields bilaterally. He appears anxious and is using accessory muscles. Heart rate is 110 bpm. \nR: Requesting an order for an immediate STAT dose of IV furosemide to address acute fluid volume overload.",

He is currently hemodynamically stable and undergoing ongoing neurological assessments.\nBackground: The client has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which he was not taking anticoagulants. He presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. A non-contrast CT of the head confirmed a left MCA infarct. A key social determinant of health is that he lives alone in a third-floor walk-up apartment, which presents a significant barrier for discharge.\nAssessment: He is alert and oriented to person and place. He has right-sided hemiparesis, with motor strength 2/5 in the right arm and 3/5 in the right leg. His speech is non-fluent and very effortful, but he can follow simple commands accurately.\nRecommendation: Continue hourly neurological checks and vital sign monitoring per stroke protocol. A formal consult with speech-language pathology is critical. Maintain fall precautions and collaborate with case management to address his complex discharge needs.",

He has been non-adherent with his medication regimen for the past three weeks. He reports recent job loss and is facing eviction, which are significant psychosocial stressors. He lives alone and has limited social support. \n\nAssessment: At 14:00, the client was observed pacing the hallway, speaking loudly and rapidly to staff and other clients. His speech pattern, as heard in the audio exhibit, is pressured with abrupt shifts between grandiose topics. He has not slept in over 48 hours. Vital signs show increasing tachycardia and hypertension. His morning lithium level was subtherapeutic. \n\nRecommendation: Continue 1:1 observation for safety. Administer PRN olanzapine as ordered for agitation. Encourage high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and fluids to address increased metabolic demands. Consult with the psychiatric team to discuss adjusting the lithium dosage based on lab results and clinical presentation.",

He reports feeling 'a bit more tired lately' and notes increased difficulty climbing the two flights of stairs to his apartment.\nB: History of severe aortic stenosis. Lifelong warfarin therapy initiated post-AVR with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Client reports good medication adherence and denies any signs of bleeding or bruising. Lives alone in a second-floor walk-up apartment, which presents a potential barrier to mobility as his fatigue increases.\nA: Alert and oriented x4. Skin warm and dry. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart rhythm is regular. Denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. Appears calm and cooperative.\nR: Obtain vital signs and a stat INR. Perform focused cardiovascular assessment. Discuss findings and client's report of increased fatigue with the cardiologist."

Focused cardiovascular assessment performed. A crisp, high-pitched metallic click is auscultated at the aortic area, synchronous with S2. S1 is normal. Heart rate is 72 bpm and regular. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds in all extremities. No peripheral edema observed. INR result from today is 2.9.\nR: The auscultated click is an expected finding for a functioning mechanical valve. The therapeutic INR confirms appropriate anticoagulation. Will continue to monitor. The client's subjective report of increased fatigue warrants further evaluation by the cardiologist, possibly an echocardiogram, to rule out any subtle decline in ventricular function despite the normal valve sounds."
