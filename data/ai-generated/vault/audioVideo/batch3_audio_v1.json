Many clients with chronic COPD develop CO2 retention (hypercapnia), which causes their central chemoreceptors to become less sensitive to CO2 as a stimulus for breathing. Instead, they rely on peripheral chemoreceptors that respond to hypoxemia (low oxygen levels). This is known as the 'hypoxic drive.' Administering excessive oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to hypoventilation, worsening hypercapnia, and potentially acute respiratory failure.
