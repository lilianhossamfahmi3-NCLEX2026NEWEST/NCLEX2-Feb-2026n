This altered neurocircuitry can lead to a state of either sensory hypersensitivity (overload) or hyposensitivity (under-stimulation).

The standard of practice requires listening for a total of 5 minutes before concluding that bowel sounds are absent. This documentation accurately communicates the assessment data without making a premature diagnosis or interpretation. The pathophysiology of post-operative ileus involves suppression of the parasympathetic nervous system and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system due to surgical stress, manipulation of the bowel, and the effects of anesthetic agents and opioids. This inhibits the myenteric plexus, causing a cessation of peristalsis. Without the movement of fluid and gas through the intestines, no sound is produced."

A prolonged ileus is a serious complication that can lead to significant third-spacing of fluid, electrolyte imbalances, abdominal compartment syndrome, and bowel ischemia.

Furthermore, the clinical presentation of a mechanical obstruction often differs from a functional obstruction (paralytic ileus). In an early mechanical obstruction, the bowel proximal to the blockage may become hyperactive, producing high-pitched sounds as it attempts to force contents past the blockage. Absent sounds are more characteristic of a paralytic ileus or a very late-stage, ischemic mechanical obstruction. The nurse's finding is a critical cue that points towards a problem with motility, but it is not diagnostic of a specific pathology."

The NCLEX emphasizes the nurse's role in precise assessment and documentation. You must document what you see, hear, and feel, not what you think it means. The distinction between 'absent' (no sounds for 5 minutes) and 'hypoactive' (infrequent sounds) is also a common point of confusion that tests precise knowledge of assessment terminology."
