He is a 62-year-old male, 70 kg, admitted at 07:15 with 40% TBSA full-thickness burns from a house fire.\n\nBACKGROUND: The fire occurred at 07:00. He has circumferential burns to his trunk and bilateral upper extremities. He has a history of hypertension. He lives alone in a rural area, which may have delayed initial care. He has been receiving Lactated Ringer's at 700 mL/hr since admission.\n\nASSESSMENT: He is increasingly restless and anxious. Vitals are trending poorly: HR 125, BP 88/58 (MAP 68), RR 28 and labored, SpO2 is now 91% on a 100% non-rebreather mask. Physical exam reveals audible wheezing and diminished bilateral breath sounds. Urine output has dropped to 10 mL in the last hour. Recent labs show significant hemoconcentration and hyperkalemia.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I believe he is developing ARDS from a severe inhalation injury and is in burn shock. I am requesting an immediate provider evaluation at the bedside. I will prepare for intubation and recommend an ABG and chest x-ray.",
