This disappearance signifies normal maturation of the central nervous system (CNS). Specifically, it reflects the myelination of higher motor pathways and the development of inhibitory control from the cerebral cortex over the more primitive brainstem centers. As voluntary motor control develops, this involuntary startle response is suppressed and replaced by more coordinated movements."

The cerebral cortex has not yet matured enough to inhibit these primitive responses. The absence of a Moro reflex this early could indicate a significant neurological deficit, such as severe CNS depression, or a peripheral nerve injury like a brachial plexus palsy sustained during birth."

It indicates a delay in CNS maturation and a failure of the cerebral cortex to integrate this primitive reflex. This lack of cortical inhibition is often associated with underlying neuropathology, such as cerebral palsy, and warrants immediate referral for a comprehensive neurological evaluation."

The re-emergence or persistence of the Moro reflex into adulthood is a definitive sign of severe upper motor neuron damage. This can occur with conditions that disrupt cortical inhibitory pathways, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, or advanced neurodegenerative diseases."

For example, the Babinski reflex normally disappears much later, around 12-24 months. Candidates may incorrectly apply the timeline of one reflex to another. Another trap is misinterpreting a persistent Moro reflex as a sign of a 'strong' or 'healthy' reflex, when its persistence beyond 6 months is a pathological sign of delayed neurological development.",
