He was started on levetiracetam. The client lives alone in a second-floor apartment, which presents a potential barrier to safe discharge and is a notable Social Determinant of Health (SDOH).\n\nAssessment: As of 16:00, his neurological checks have been stable, remaining alert and oriented x4 with a GCS of 15. He reports a mild headache, rated 2/10. All vital signs are within normal limits. Seizure precautions, including padded side rails and suction at the bedside, are in place.\n\nRecommendation: Continue neurological checks every 4 hours. Monitor closely for any new neurological changes or seizure activity. Reinforce seizure safety education with the client. A case management consult is needed to evaluate home safety prior to discharge.",

Initial post-op recovery was unremarkable. Her surgical dressing was dry and intact with minimal swelling noted at 12:30. She has no history of respiratory disease. She lives alone in a second-floor apartment, which may present a challenge for follow-up care.\nA: Vital signs are trending: HR 112, RR 24, SpO₂ 93% on room air, BP 148/88. On assessment, there is new, visible fullness around the surgical incision. She reports a 'tight' feeling in her throat and is having difficulty speaking in full sentences. Auscultation confirms inspiratory stridor.\nR: I have elevated the head of the bed to 90 degrees. I need you at the bedside immediately for evaluation.

The client lives alone in a second-floor apartment, which presents a mobility challenge. He reports minimal post-operative pain, rated 2/10.\nAssessment: Upon assessment of the left forearm, the surgical site is clean, dry, and intact with minimal swelling. No erythema or drainage noted. A palpable, continuous vibration ('thrill') is present over the fistula. Auscultation reveals a continuous, low-pitched 'machinery-like' bruit. Capillary refill in the left hand is less than 3 seconds.\nRecommendation: Continue routine post-operative monitoring of the fistula site every 4 hours. Reinforce client education on avoiding constrictive clothing, blood pressure measurements, and venipuncture in the left arm. Document the presence of a positive thrill and bruit as an expected finding indicating fistula patency."

Client lives alone in a rural area, limiting immediate family support.\n(A) Vitals are deteriorating: BP is now 88/62 mmHg (MAP 71), HR 128 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on 2L NC. Heart sounds are muffled and distant on auscultation. Jugular veins are distended to the angle of the jaw at 45 degrees. Lungs remain clear bilaterally. Skin is cool and clammy.\n(R) I suspect the client is developing obstructive shock secondary to cardiac tamponade. I recommend a STAT portable echocardiogram and request you come to the bedside immediately to assess for emergent pericardiocentesis."

She lives alone in a two-story home and expresses concern about her ability to remain independent. She mentions having difficulty affording over-the-counter analgesics on her fixed income, a potential barrier to care. No recent trauma to the knee.\nA: On examination, the right knee has a mild effusion without erythema or warmth. Audible and palpable coarse crepitus noted with passive flexion and extension. Range of motion is limited by 15 degrees in flexion due to pain. Gait is slow and antalgic.\nR: Administer scheduled acetaminophen. Reinforce joint protection strategies. Place a consult for physical therapy to evaluate for an assistive device and strengthening exercises. Discuss potential for intra-articular corticosteroid injection with the provider."

Initiate IV access for fluids and medications.\n\nProgress Note (10:30)\nSituation: Reassessment of neurological status prior to lumbar puncture.\nBackground: Client continues to report a '10/10' headache.\nAssessment: A positive Brudzinski's sign was elicited. Kernig's sign is also positive bilaterally. Pupils remain equal and reactive to light.\nRecommendation: Notify the healthcare provider of the positive meningeal signs. Ensure empiric antibiotics are ready for administration immediately following the lumbar puncture.",

The family lives in a rural area approximately 90 minutes from the nearest pediatric specialist, which is a key consideration for their discharge education and follow-up planning. They have expressed some anxiety about recognizing developmental milestones.\nAssessment: Vital signs are stable. The infant is pink, well-perfused, and actively feeding. All initial newborn screenings are within normal limits. A head-to-toe assessment is complete, revealing all primitive reflexes, including a strong, symmetrical Moro reflex, are present and appropriate for gestational age.\nRecommendation: Continue routine newborn care.
