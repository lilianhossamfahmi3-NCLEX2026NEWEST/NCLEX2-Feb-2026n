To maintain cerebral perfusion, blood must accelerate through this narrowed segment. This high-velocity flow becomes chaotic and disorganized distal to the plaque, creating vibrations in the arterial wall that are audible with a stethoscope. The bruit's intensity doesn't directly correlate with stenosis severity; a very tight stenosis may produce a faint or absent bruit. This turbulence signifies a high risk for plaque rupture and thrombus formation, leading to an embolic stroke. **Clinical Pearl:** Always correlate the presence and character of a bruit with other neurological findings.

The pain and resistance are due to stretching of inflamed meninges and spinal nerve roots.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Meningitis causes inflammation of the meninges, increasing intracranial pressure and sensitizing the meninges and spinal nerve roots. Extending the knee with the hip flexed stretches these inflamed nerve roots, triggering a protective hamstring spasm and causing pain. This resistance to knee extension is a key sign of meningeal irritation.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess for other signs of meningitis, such as nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), fever, photophobia, and altered mental status.

This compression can be caused by disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or piriformis syndrome. The straight leg raise test (Lasegue's sign) stretches the sciatic nerve, eliciting pain. However, Kernig's sign specifically targets meningeal irritation by stretching nerve roots within the inflamed meninges.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Sciatica pain is usually unilateral and follows a dermatomal pattern. It is not typically associated with systemic signs of infection like fever or nuchal rigidity. Differentiate from Kernig's sign by performing a straight leg raise.

This leads to clot formation and inflammation of the vein wall (thrombophlebitis). Assessment findings include unilateral edema, erythema, warmth, and calf tenderness. Homans' sign (pain on dorsiflexion) is no longer a reliable indicator.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Assess for risk factors for DVT, such as prolonged immobility, surgery, and certain medical conditions.

The fracture causes pain due to bone disruption, periosteal irritation, and surrounding soft tissue damage. Hallmark signs include a shortened and externally rotated leg on the affected side and severe pain with any hip movement.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Clients with hip fractures experience intense pain with any hip movement, making the Kernig's maneuver difficult or impossible to perform.
