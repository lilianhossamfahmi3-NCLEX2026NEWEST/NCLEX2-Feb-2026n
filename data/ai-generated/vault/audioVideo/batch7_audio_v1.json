To maintain cerebral perfusion, blood must accelerate through this narrowed segment. This high-velocity flow becomes chaotic and disorganized distal to the plaque, creating vibrations in the arterial wall that are audible with a stethoscope. The bruit's intensity doesn't directly correlate with stenosis severity; a very tight stenosis may produce a faint or absent bruit.

The video demonstrates nystagmus, an involuntary, rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. **Pathophysiology:** Nystagmus indicates a disruption in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which stabilizes vision during head movements. The VOR involves the vestibular system (inner ear), cranial nerves (III, IV, VI, VIII), and the cerebellum. Jerk nystagmus, as seen here, features a slow drift of the eyes off target, followed by a rapid corrective saccade. This can result from lesions in the cerebellum, brainstem, or vestibular system; inner ear disorders (e.g., Meniere's disease); or drug toxicity (e.g., phenytoin, alcohol). The underlying mechanism often involves an imbalance in neuronal firing rates within these control centers, leading to inappropriate activation of the extraocular muscles. **Clinical Pearl:** Document the direction of the fast phase (e.g., left-beating nystagmus when looking left), as this helps localize the lesion. Assess for associated symptoms like vertigo, nausea, and hearing loss. Report: S: Patient exhibiting involuntary, rhythmic eye movements. B: Neurological exam performed at 1400. A: Nystagmus observed upon lateral gaze. R: Notify provider for further evaluation and potential imaging (MRI/CT)."

Absence of the Moro reflex at 1 month could indicate severe neurological depression, prematurity, or birth injuries affecting the peripheral nerves or spinal cord. Further investigation is warranted if the reflex is absent.",

It suggests a delay in neurological development and a lack of cortical inhibition of the brainstem reflex. This can be associated with conditions such as cerebral palsy or other neurological disorders. A referral to a neurologist is crucial for further evaluation.",

Always assess the Moro reflex in conjunction with other neurological assessments. Premature infants may exhibit a weaker or delayed Moro reflex initially.",
      "deepPathophysiologyRationale": "The Moro reflex is mediated by the brainstem, specifically the vestibular nuclei and reticular formation. The stimulus triggers a cascade of neuronal activity leading to the characteristic arm abduction, extension, and adduction. As the cerebral cortex matures, it exerts inhibitory control over these brainstem reflexes. Myelination of corticospinal tracts plays a crucial role in this inhibition. Failure of this cortical inhibition leads to the persistence of the Moro reflex beyond the normal timeframe, indicating potential neurological impairment.",
