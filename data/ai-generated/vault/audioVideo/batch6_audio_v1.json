The electronic fetal monitor is showing recurrent, abrupt decelerations in the fetal heart rate (FHR).\n\nBACKGROUND: Admitted at 08:00 with spontaneous rupture of membranes. Labor has been progressing as expected. An epidural was placed at 12:30 for pain management. Patient lives in a rural community with limited transportation, which was a barrier to attending some prenatal education classes (SDOH factor).\n\nASSESSMENT: Maternal vital signs are stable. Vaginal exam at 14:00 reveals cervix is 7 cm dilated, 100% effaced, and fetal station is -1. FHR baseline is 140 bpm with moderate variability. Contractions are every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. The FHR pattern consists of abrupt, V-shaped drops to 90 bpm, lasting approximately 30 seconds, with a rapid return to baseline. These decelerations are variable in their timing relative to contractions.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediately reposition patient to the left lateral position to alleviate potential cord compression. Continue close monitoring of the FHR and contraction pattern. If decelerations persist or worsen, prepare for a potential amnioinfusion per standing orders and notify the provider immediately."

This pattern is the hallmark of a variable deceleration, which is caused by umbilical cord compression. Pathophysiologically, transient compression of the umbilical cord first occludes the low-pressure umbilical vein, decreasing venous return and causing a brief reflex fetal tachycardia. As compression increases, the umbilical arteries are occluded, sharply increasing fetal systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Fetal baroreceptors detect this hypertension, triggering a vagal response that causes the abrupt FHR decrease. Relief of compression allows a rapid return to baseline.",

He was admitted two days ago for stabilization of auditory hallucinations. He resides in a group home and has minimal family support. His baseline neurological exam on admission was unremarkable for involuntary movements.\nAssessment: The movements are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia. His vital signs are stable, and his creatine kinase level is within normal limits, ruling out NMS. He is alert and oriented but seems unaware of the movements. An Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) assessment is indicated.\nRecommendation: I request a provider evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and discuss management, such as switching to a second-generation antipsychotic or adding a VMAT2 inhibitor.",

Vitals have remained stable since admission.\nA: During morning assessment, client observed with new-onset, persistent, involuntary orofacial movements, including lip-smacking, chewing motions, and tongue protrusion. Client is unaware of these movements. No signs of acute dystonia or akathisia. Neurological exam otherwise unchanged. No fever or muscle rigidity. These findings are highly suspicious for tardive dyskinesia.\nR: Withhold morning dose of haloperidol pending provider evaluation. Prepare to perform an AIMS assessment to quantify movements. Will notify provider of findings via SBAR communication and recommend consultation for medication adjustment."

The client's adult child is the primary caregiver and is at the bedside, expressing anxiety about the change in breathing. The family lives in a rural area with limited home health resources, which prompted this admission for end-of-life symptom management.\n\nAssessment: Vital signs are trending down: HR 52, BP 88/54 mmHg (MAP 65), SpO2 88% on room air. The respiratory pattern is consistent with Cheyne-Stokes. Neurologically, the client is unresponsive to verbal stimuli but withdraws to painful stimuli. Skin is cool with mottling noted on lower extremities.\n\nRecommendation: Continue comfort-focused care per the hospice plan. Provide education and emotional support to the family regarding the end-of-life process. Administer PRN morphine for any signs of air hunger or respiratory distress.

A rise in PaCO2 stimulates hyperpnea (crescendo), which overcorrects and blows off too much CO2. The resulting hypocapnia suppresses the respiratory drive, leading to hypopnea (decrescendo) and apnea. The cycle restarts as CO2 builds up again."

The client is now exhibiting deep, rapid, gasping respirations at 32 breaths per minute, consistent with Kussmaul breathing. A distinct fruity odor is present on their breath. \nBackground: The client has a history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. They reported running out of their insulin glargine three days ago due to financial constraints and has had poor oral intake since. Admission blood glucose was 580 mg/dL. \nAssessment: The client is experiencing severe metabolic acidosis as a compensatory response to DKA. Vital signs are trending towards instability: HR 122, BP 90/60, SpO2 98% on room air. The client is lethargic but arousable. The current respiratory pattern is an attempt to correct a critically low blood pH. \nRecommendation: I recommend immediate initiation of the DKA protocol, including an IV insulin infusion and aggressive fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride. We need stat arterial blood gas and serum electrolyte panels. Please confirm these orders.",

The peripheral and central chemoreceptors detect the high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). This stimulates the brain's respiratory center to increase both the rate and depth of breathing. This hyperventilation, known as Kussmaul respirations, eliminates CO2. Since CO2 forms carbonic acid in the blood, its removal reduces the overall acid load, partially compensating for the metabolic acidosis and attempting to normalize the pH."

Her surgical course was uncomplicated. She has no known drug allergies. Her morning vital signs are stable. She lives alone and expressed concern about managing her recovery at home, which is a potential social determinant of health affecting her stress level and access to follow-up care.\n\nAssessment: Upon assessment, she is alert and oriented. She reports tingling around her mouth and in her fingertips. I assessed for Trousseau's sign by inflating the BP cuff, which elicited a positive carpal spasm. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ and brisk bilaterally. Cardiac monitor shows a sinus rhythm at 78 bpm with a QT interval of 0.46 seconds.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend a stat serum calcium, ionized calcium, and magnesium level.

They live in a rural community, and this is their first visit to a hospital due to transportation challenges, a potential social determinant of health affecting access to care. Assessment: The infant is irritable but consolable. Physical exam reveals tacky mucous membranes and a sunken anterior fontanelle. The abdomen is soft, with a palpable, firm, olive-shaped mass noted in the epigastric region. During the assessment, visible peristaltic waves were observed moving from left to right across the upper abdomen, immediately preceding a large projectile vomit. Recommendation: Maintain NPO status. Prepare for intravenous fluid resuscitation to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Anticipate orders for an abdominal ultrasound to confirm diagnosis and a pediatric surgery consult.",
