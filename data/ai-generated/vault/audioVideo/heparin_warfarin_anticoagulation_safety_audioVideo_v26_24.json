She has a history of atrial fibrillation, managed with warfarin.\n\nBackground: Her pre-op INR was 2.8. Warfarin was held pre-operatively. Post-op, heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 8 hours was started for DVT prophylaxis. She reports surgical site pain, rated 6/10.\n\nAssessment: She is alert and oriented x 3. The right lower extremity has a surgical dressing intact with a small amount of serosanguinous drainage. Pedal pulses are present bilaterally. Vitals: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Bowel sounds are present. She is voiding without difficulty.\n\nRecommendation: Monitor INR and aPTT due to concurrent warfarin and heparin. Assess pain and administer analgesics as prescribed. Monitor the surgical site for infection. Evaluate the need for bridging therapy based on INR levels.",
