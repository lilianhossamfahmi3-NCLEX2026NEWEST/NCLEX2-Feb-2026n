Background: Client has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation managed with warfarin (held for 5 days pre-admission), hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She lives alone in a second-floor apartment with her adult child living nearby. Pre-operative INR was 1.2. Assessment: Client is alert and oriented x4. Reports severe pain (8/10) in the right hip, which is externally rotated and shortened. Distal pulses, sensation, and movement are intact in the right lower extremity. Vital signs are stable. Recommendation: Prepare client for right hip open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Continue cardiac monitoring due to atrial fibrillation. Provide IV analgesia for pain management and maintain NPO status. Ensure surgical consent is signed and on the chart."

Assessment: Vitals remain stable. The surgical dressing is clean, dry, and intact with a small amount of serosanguinous drainage noted. The right lower extremity has 1+ pitting edema; pedal pulse is 2+ and brisk. Morning labs returned with an INR of 1.8 and an aPTT of 35 seconds. The client is hesitant to ambulate with physical therapy, citing incisional pain. Recommendation: Administer scheduled PRN analgesia 30 minutes prior to physical therapy. Continue DVT prophylaxis as ordered. Notify the healthcare provider of the subtherapeutic INR result. Continue to monitor for signs of bleeding or thrombosis."
