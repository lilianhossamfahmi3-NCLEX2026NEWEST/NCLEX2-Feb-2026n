History of atrial fibrillation, currently managed with warfarin. \n\nBackground: Pre-op INR was 2.8. Warfarin held pre-operatively. Post-op, started on heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 8 hours for DVT prophylaxis. Client reports pain at surgical site, rated 6/10. No other significant medical history reported. \n\nAssessment: Alert and oriented x 3. Right lower extremity with surgical dressing intact, small amount of serosanguinous drainage noted. Pedal pulses present bilaterally. Vital signs stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. Lung sounds clear bilaterally. Bowel sounds present. Patient voiding without difficulty. \n\nRecommendation: Monitor INR and aPTT levels due to concurrent warfarin and heparin therapy. Assess pain and administer analgesics as prescribed. Monitor surgical site for signs of infection. Consider need for bridging therapy based on INR levels. Evaluate for potential warfarin reversal if bleeding risk increases.",
