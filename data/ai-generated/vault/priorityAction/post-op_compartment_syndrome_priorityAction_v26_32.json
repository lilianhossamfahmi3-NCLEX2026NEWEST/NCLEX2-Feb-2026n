        "correct": "Compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening condition caused by increased pressure within a confined space, leading to decreased blood flow and nerve damage. The priority is to immediately assess the 6 P's (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Pressure) to evaluate for compartment syndrome. Notifying the surgeon promptly is crucial for potential fasciotomy to relieve the pressure. Elevating the extremity at heart level can help reduce edema but is secondary to immediate assessment. Administering more pain medication will not address the underlying cause and may mask worsening symptoms.",
        "incorrect": "Administering another dose of pain medication will not address the underlying problem of compartment syndrome. Elevating the leg above the heart can reduce arterial pressure, potentially worsening ischemia. Assessing pulses distal to the injury is an important component of assessing compartment syndrome, but it is not the immediate priority. The priority is a comprehensive assessment of all 6 P's.",
