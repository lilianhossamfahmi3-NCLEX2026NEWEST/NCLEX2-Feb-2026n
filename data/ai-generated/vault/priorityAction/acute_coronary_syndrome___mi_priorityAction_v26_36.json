    "correct": "Administering oxygen is the highest priority to address the patient's hypoxemia (SpO2 92%) and increase oxygen delivery to the myocardium. This is crucial in the setting of a potential myocardial infarction to minimize further ischemic damage. Rapid oxygenation is a cornerstone of initial ACS management.",
    "incorrect": "Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important for diagnosing the type of MI (STEMI vs. NSTEMI), but it is secondary to ensuring adequate oxygenation. It should be done immediately after oxygen is administered. \nAdministering morphine is indicated for pain management in MI, but it should be done after addressing oxygenation and obtaining IV access. Morphine can also lower blood pressure, which is already low.\nInitiating an IV line is important for medication administration and fluid resuscitation, but it is less urgent than ensuring adequate oxygenation. IV access should be established concurrently with oxygen administration.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In suspected MI, always prioritize oxygenation, especially if SpO2 is below 94%.",
      "Remember the MONA acronym (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin), but prioritize based on patient assessment.",
      "Hypotension in the setting of MI can be exacerbated by morphine and nitrates; use with caution."
