        "correct": "Administering oxygen is the highest priority because the patient's SpO2 is 92%, indicating hypoxemia. Increasing oxygen delivery to the myocardium is crucial in the setting of a potential myocardial infarction to minimize further ischemic damage. Rapid oxygenation is a cornerstone of initial acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management.",
        "incorrect": "Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important for diagnosing the type of MI (STEMI vs. NSTEMI), but it is secondary to ensuring adequate oxygenation. It should be done immediately after oxygen is administered.\nAdministering morphine is indicated for pain management in MI, but it should be done after addressing oxygenation and establishing IV access. Morphine can also lower blood pressure, which is already low.\nInitiating an IV line is important for medication administration and fluid resuscitation, but it is less urgent than ensuring adequate oxygenation. IV access should be established concurrently with oxygen administration.",

            "In suspected MI, always prioritize oxygenation, especially if SpO2 is below 94%.",
