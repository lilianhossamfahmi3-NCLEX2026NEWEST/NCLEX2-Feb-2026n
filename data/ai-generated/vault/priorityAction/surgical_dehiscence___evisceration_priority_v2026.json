She is 6 days post-op from an exploratory laparotomy.\n\nSituation: Mrs. Smith is reporting a sudden 'popping' sensation at her incision site and is experiencing increased pain.\n\nBackground: She has a history of obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, which has complicated wound healing. Her surgical site has been monitored closely for infection, and she has been afebrile until now. She received pain medication 3 hours ago.\n\nAssessment: Upon examination, I observed a complete separation of the lower portion of her surgical incision with a loop of bowel protruding. There is a moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage. Her vital signs are: HR 110, BP 90/60, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F).\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate assessment by the surgical team. I am concerned about possible evisceration and potential sepsis. I will continue to monitor her vital signs and keep the patient NPO."
