        "a": {
            "content": "This action is incorrect and dangerous. During the tonic phase of a seizure, intense masseter muscle contraction causes powerful jaw clenching (trismus). Forcing any object into the mouth against this force can fracture teeth, leading to aspiration of fragments into the tracheobronchial tree, causing airway obstruction or aspiration pneumonia. It can also cause severe soft tissue lacerations to the lips, tongue, and oral mucosa."
        },
        "b": {
            "content": "This is the correct first action. The immediate priority is preventing physical trauma. The tonic phase involves abrupt loss of consciousness and sustained muscle contraction, making the client's body rigid. A fall from a chair in this state can cause significant head trauma (e.g., skull fracture, intracranial hemorrhage). Lowering the client to the floor mitigates the force of impact. Clearing the area of furniture and other objects prevents injury during the subsequent clonic phase, where rhythmic, powerful muscle jerking could cause the client's limbs to strike hard surfaces, resulting in fractures or contusions."
        },
        "c": {
            "content": "This action is incorrect and can cause severe iatrogenic injury. The clonic phase involves powerful, involuntary muscle contractions. Applying external restraints creates an opposing force against these flexing and extending muscles. This can lead to orthopedic injuries such as fractures of long bones (humerus, femur), joint dislocations (especially the shoulder), and soft tissue damage. The intense muscle strain against resistance can also contribute to rhabdomyolysis."
        },
        "d": {
            "content": "This action is incorrect as the initial step. While IV lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is a first-line treatment for terminating seizure activity by potentiating the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, its administration is not the first priority. The immediate, life-threatening risk is physical trauma from the environment. Securing the client's physical safety must occur before any pharmacologic intervention, which requires time to establish IV access, prepare the medication, and administer it. Environmental safety is the most immediate and critical action."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "This question traps test-takers who fail to differentiate between immediate environmental safety and subsequent medical or pharmacological interventions. A common error is to select a 'treatment' (like lorazepam) or a historically incorrect 'procedure' (like a tongue blade) over the fundamental nursing action of protecting the client from immediate physical harm. The key is to apply the nursing process and Maslow's hierarchy, where safety is a foundational need that must be addressed before other interventions.",
    "mnemonics": "For seizure safety priorities, remember 'SAFE SIDE':\n\n- **S**tay with client: Do not leave them unattended.\n- **A**ssist to floor: Prevent injury from falling.\n- **F**ree of objects: Clear the immediate environment.\n- **E**ase restrictive clothing: Loosen collars or ties.\n\n- **S**ide-lying position: After convulsions cease, turn the client to their side to facilitate drainage of oral secretions and prevent airway occlusion by the tongue.\n- **I**n-mouth objects avoided: Never force anything into the mouth.\n- **D**ocument: Note the time of onset, duration, and characteristics of the seizure.\n- **E**nsure post-ictal monitoring: Assess vital signs, neurological status, and orientation after the seizure."
