Background: He has been seizure-free since admission, maintained on a scheduled dose of divalproex sodium. Assessment: At 14:15, the patient began exhibiting repetitive jerking movements of his extremities, lasting > 5 minutes. He is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, and his oxygen saturation has dropped to 88%. His heart rate is 120 bpm, and his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg. Pupils are equal and reactive. The bedside EEG monitor shows continuous seizure activity. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to stop the seizure activity, including administering a benzodiazepine per protocol and preparing for possible intubation if respiratory depression occurs. The patient may require a loading dose of an anticonvulsant like phenytoin or fosphenytoin after the initial seizure control."
