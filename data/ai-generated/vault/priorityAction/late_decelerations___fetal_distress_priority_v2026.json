Current cervical dilation is 6 cm, 80% effaced, and 0 station. Assessment: At 14:30, FHR monitor shows repetitive late decelerations, with FHR dropping to 110 bpm after the peak of each contraction. Maternal BP is 100/60 mmHg, and HR is 110 bpm. Contractions every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. Denies pain beyond contractions. Chart indicates no maternal medical problems. Urine output decreased over last two hours. Recommendations: Immediate intervention is needed to address fetal distress indicated by late decelerations. Consider discontinuing Pitocin, administering oxygen, repositioning the mother, and notifying the physician immediately for further orders and potential intervention."

    "correct": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency and potential fetal hypoxia. Administering oxygen and repositioning the mother to a left lateral position are immediate interventions to improve oxygen delivery to the fetus. Oxygen increases maternal oxygen saturation, increasing oxygen availability to the fetus. Left lateral positioning reduces pressure on the vena cava, improving venous return and increasing cardiac output, thereby enhancing placental perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Documenting findings (B), while important, delays immediate interventions needed to address the fetal distress. Preparing for an emergency cesarean section (C) might be necessary, but initial interventions should focus on resolving the fetal distress. Administering an intravenous bolus (D) is less critical than improving oxygenation and placental perfusion in this acute situation. While maternal hydration is important, the immediate priority is to address the fetal hypoxia.",
