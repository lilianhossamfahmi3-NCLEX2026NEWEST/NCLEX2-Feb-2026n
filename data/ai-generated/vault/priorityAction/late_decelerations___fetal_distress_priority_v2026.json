Epidural was placed at 10:00. Current cervical dilation is 6 cm, 80% effaced, and 0 station. Assessment: At 14:30, the fetal heart rate (FHR) monitor shows repetitive late decelerations, with the fetal heart rate dropping to 110 bpm after the peak of each contraction. Maternal blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, and heart rate is 110 bpm. Contractions are occurring every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. The client denies any pain beyond the contractions. Review of chart indicates no maternal medical problems. Urine output decreased over last two hours. Recommendations: Immediate intervention is needed to address the fetal distress indicated by the late decelerations. Consider discontinuing Pitocin, administering oxygen, repositioning the mother, and notifying the physician immediately for further orders and potential intervention."

    "correct": "Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia. Administering oxygen and repositioning the mother to a left lateral position are immediate interventions to improve oxygen delivery to the fetus. Oxygen increases the maternal oxygen saturation, which in turn increases oxygen availability to the fetus. Left lateral positioning reduces pressure on the vena cava, improving venous return and increasing cardiac output, thereby enhancing placental perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Documenting findings, while important, delays immediate interventions needed to address the fetal distress. Preparing for an emergency cesarean section might be necessary, but initial interventions should focus on resolving the fetal distress. Administering an intravenous bolus is less critical than improving oxygenation and placental perfusion in this acute situation. While maternal hydration is important, the immediate priority is to address the fetal hypoxia.",
