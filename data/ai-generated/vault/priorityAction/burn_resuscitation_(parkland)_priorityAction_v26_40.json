B: Patient was found unresponsive in a burning building. PMH includes hypertension, managed with lisinopril. A: Patient is currently intubated and sedated. Burn wounds are being assessed and dressed. Initial fluid resuscitation is underway per Parkland formula. Urine output is being closely monitored. Vitals stable post-intubation, but requiring high FiO2. A central line was placed for fluid administration. Labs are pending. R: Continue fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula. Monitor urine output hourly, titrating fluids to maintain 30-50 mL/hr. Obtain ABGs in one hour and adjust ventilator settings as needed. Monitor electrolytes closely and replace as indicated. Pain management as needed. Anticipate wound care consultation. Elevate extremities to minimize edema. Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome. Consider escharotomies if indicated. Psychosocial support for family.",
