Be prepared to provide ventilatory support (e.g., bag-valve-mask ventilation) if naloxone is ineffective or delayed. Educate clients and families about the signs of opioid overdose and how to administer naloxone. Consider the possibility of co-ingestion of other substances (e.g., benzodiazepines) that may potentiate respiratory depression. Remember that naloxone has a shorter half-life than many opioids, so repeated doses may be necessary. Observe the client for recurrence of respiratory depression after naloxone administration ('re-narcotization')."

While assessment is crucial, in a clear, life-threatening situation like opioid overdose with classic signs, immediate intervention (naloxone) takes precedence over further assessment (SpO2, cardiac monitoring). The NCLEX expects nurses to recognize when sufficient data exists to act decisively and prevent irreversible harm. Prioritize interventions that directly address the immediate threat to the client's life."

                "content": "Incorrect. While stimulation might temporarily increase respiratory effort, it doesn't address the underlying opioid-induced respiratory depression. Morphine binds to mu-opioid receptors in the brainstem, suppressing the respiratory center. Stimulation doesn't reverse this binding or the resulting hypoventilation. This delays the administration of naloxone, the definitive treatment, and risks worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia. The client will likely return to a state of severe respiratory depression once the stimulus is removed.",

                "content": "Correct. The client exhibits classic signs of opioid overdose: respiratory depression (RR 6), pinpoint pupils (miosis), and altered mental status (somnolence) after morphine administration. Morphine, an opioid agonist, depresses the medullary respiratory center, leading to hypoventilation, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia. Naloxone is a competitive opioid antagonist with a high affinity for mu-opioid receptors. IV administration rapidly displaces morphine from these receptors, reversing respiratory depression and restoring adequate ventilation. This is the priority action to prevent respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and irreversible brain damage.",

                "content": "Incorrect. While cardiac monitoring is important, it's secondary to addressing the immediate respiratory compromise. The client's potential cardiac instability (e.g., bradycardia, dysrhythmias) is a consequence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia caused by respiratory depression. Initiating cardiac monitoring delays the administration of naloxone, the definitive treatment for opioid-induced respiratory depression. Restoring adequate ventilation with naloxone will improve oxygenation and ventilation, addressing the underlying cause of potential cardiac issues.",

The clinical presentation (somnolence, pinpoint pupils, RR 6 after morphine) strongly suggests opioid overdose. Delaying naloxone administration to obtain an SpO2 reading wastes critical time and increases the risk of severe hypoxia, brain damage, and cardiac arrest. The priority is to administer naloxone based on the clinical picture, not to delay treatment for confirmatory data.",

Oxygen saturation is likely low, but immediate intervention is required.\nRecommendation: Administer naloxone IV immediately as prescribed. Prepare for potential need for repeated doses and ventilatory support. Monitor respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness closely after naloxone administration. Notify the provider immediately after naloxone administration."
