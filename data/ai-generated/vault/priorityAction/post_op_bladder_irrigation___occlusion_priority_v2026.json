He has a continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) running.\nB: History of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). TURP performed due to urinary retention and recurrent UTIs. CBI initiated post-op to prevent clot formation.\nA: Patient is reporting lower abdominal pain rated 7/10. Bladder is distended upon palpation. Urine output via the catheter has decreased significantly over the last hour from 150 mL/hr to 30 mL/hr. The drainage is reddish, with some small clots noted. Vital signs are stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 99.1°F (37.3°C).\nR: I am concerned about a potential catheter obstruction and bladder distension. I recommend immediate irrigation of the catheter to remove any clots and restore adequate urine flow. I am also concerned about potential bladder spasms, which could be contributing to the pain."

Using a piston syringe allows for controlled and gentle irrigation to avoid further complications.",

While bladder spasms may be contributing to the pain, resolving the obstruction should be the priority.\n\nNotifying the healthcare provider is important, but it is not the FIRST action. The nurse should first attempt to resolve the obstruction independently. Delayed intervention could cause increased patient discomfort and potential complications.\n\nRepositioning the patient is unlikely to resolve the obstruction. The problem is likely a physical blockage within the catheter, not the patient's position.",
