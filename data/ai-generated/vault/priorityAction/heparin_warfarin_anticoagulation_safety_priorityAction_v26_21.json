            "option2": "An INR of 2.8 is within the therapeutic range (2.0-3.0) for warfarin therapy in DVT, so no immediate intervention is needed based on this value alone.",
            "option3": "Epistaxis (nosebleed) is a sign of potential over-anticoagulation and bleeding risk. This requires immediate nursing intervention to assess the severity of the bleeding, notify the provider, and potentially adjust the heparin and/or warfarin dosage. It may indicate the need for Vitamin K administration.",
            "option4": "A hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL is below the normal range (12-16 g/dL) and could indicate anemia, possibly due to bleeding from anticoagulation therapy. This warrants immediate attention, further investigation, and potential intervention such as blood transfusion.",
            "option5": "A platelet count of 140,000/mcL is below the normal range (150,000-400,000/mcL), indicating thrombocytopenia. This increases the risk of bleeding and requires immediate nursing intervention. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) should be ruled out.",
            "option6": "An aPTT of 70 seconds is prolonged compared to the normal range (30-40 seconds). This suggests that the heparin is having a greater-than-expected effect, increasing the risk of bleeding. The heparin infusion rate may need to be reduced. Protamine sulfate may be considered if bleeding is excessive.",
            "option7": "Mild leg pain (3/10) is an expected symptom of DVT and, while it should be monitored, it is not the priority in the presence of potential bleeding complications.",
