History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Allergy to penicillin. Assessment: At 14:00, the client is alert and oriented, reporting mild leg pain (3/10). Heparin drip is infusing per protocol. Warfarin 5mg PO daily. Current INR is 2.8 (target 2.0-3.0). At 14:15, new onset epistaxis is noted with a small amount of blood. Vital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. At 14:30, the client reports increased bruising on arms. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Urine is amber and clear. Stool not assessed. Recommendation: Hold the warfarin. Decrease heparin infusion per protocol. Order a stat repeat INR, CBC, and coagulation studies. Monitor for further bleeding. Obtain a stool sample for occult blood.",

            "option1": "Elevated blood pressure (150/90 mmHg) requires monitoring and potential intervention, but in the context of anticoagulation therapy and potential bleeding, it is not the MOST immediate concern. The focus should be on preventing and managing bleeding complications.",
            "option2": "An INR of 2.8 falls within the therapeutic range (2.0-3.0) for warfarin therapy in DVT. While it indicates the warfarin is effective, the presence of bleeding signs necessitates further investigation and potential dosage adjustment, but the INR itself isn't the immediate problem.",
            "option3": "Epistaxis (nosebleed) is a significant sign of potential over-anticoagulation and bleeding risk. This requires immediate nursing intervention to assess the severity of the bleeding, notify the provider, and potentially adjust the heparin and/or warfarin dosage. Vitamin K or protamine sulfate may be needed.",
            "option4": "A hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL is below the normal range (12-16 g/dL), suggesting anemia, potentially due to bleeding from anticoagulation therapy. This warrants immediate attention, further investigation (CBC), and potential intervention such as blood transfusion if the bleeding is significant.",
            "option5": "A platelet count of 140,000/mcL is below the normal range (150,000-400,000/mcL), indicating thrombocytopenia. This increases the risk of bleeding and requires immediate nursing intervention. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) should be considered, especially if the client has been on heparin for several days.",
            "option6": "An aPTT of 70 seconds is prolonged compared to the normal range (30-40 seconds). This suggests that the heparin is having a greater-than-expected effect, increasing the risk of bleeding. The heparin infusion rate may need to be reduced or temporarily held. Protamine sulfate may be considered if bleeding is excessive.",
            "option7": "Mild leg pain (3/10) is an expected symptom of DVT. While it should be monitored and managed, it is not the priority in the presence of potential bleeding complications indicated by epistaxis, low hemoglobin and platelet levels, and prolonged aPTT.",
            "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "When managing patients on heparin and warfarin, prioritize monitoring for bleeding. Epistaxis, bruising, decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, and prolonged aPTT/INR are key indicators. Prompt intervention can prevent severe complications. Always consider Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) in patients on heparin who develop thrombocytopenia.",
        "questionTrap": "The question trap is to be falsely reassured by the therapeutic INR and overlook the more subtle, yet critical, signs of bleeding (epistaxis, bruising) and the abnormal lab values (low hemoglobin/platelets, prolonged aPTT). These findings indicate the need to adjust the anticoagulation therapy, regardless of the INR.",
        "mnemonic": "B-H-E-A-P: Bleeding (Epistaxis/Bruising), Hemoglobin (low), Epistaxis, aPTT (prolonged), Platelets (low). Remember to address these findings immediately in anticoagulated patients.",
