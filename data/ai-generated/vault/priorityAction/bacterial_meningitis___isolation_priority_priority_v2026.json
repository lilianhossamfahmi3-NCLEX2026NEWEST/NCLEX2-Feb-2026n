He denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. I: On arrival, the patient is alert but disoriented. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. He complains of photophobia and nausea. Neurological exam reveals nuchal rigidity and a positive Kernig's sign. O: The patient is currently being evaluated for possible meningitis. We have initiated IV fluids and obtained blood cultures. I am concerned about the possibility of bacterial meningitis given his symptoms and clinical presentation. I recommend initiating empiric antibiotic therapy and droplet precautions immediately. We should also prepare for a lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis."

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency requiring immediate droplet precautions to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel and other patients. This includes a private room and PPE. Delaying isolation precautions increases the risk of nosocomial infection. The patient's symptoms and presentation strongly suggest bacterial meningitis, making immediate isolation a priority even before definitive diagnosis.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is appropriate for fever management, but it is a lower priority than preventing the spread of a potentially deadly infection like bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but initiating droplet precautions takes precedence to protect others from potential exposure. While ruling out increased ICP is important, it does not take priority over immediate isolation precautions in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis. Delaying isolation could have severe consequences for others.",
