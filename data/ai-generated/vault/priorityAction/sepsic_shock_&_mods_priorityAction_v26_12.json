He was brought in by ambulance from a nursing home after being found unresponsive with a fever. Current vital signs (14:00): BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 32 bpm and labored, SpO2 89% on room air, Temp 39.5°C (103.1°F). The patient is lethargic and oriented only to name. Skin is warm and flushed. Urine output has been minimal over the past 2 hours (20 mL total). Current lab results (14:00) show: WBC 18,000/µL, Lactate 4.5 mmol/L, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL. The patient has a central line and a Foley catheter in place. The provider was notified, and orders were received. Antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) are prescribed. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids is also ordered. Oxygen therapy is initiated via nasal cannula at 6L/min. The SBAR and MAR are available for review.",

            "correct": "The priority in septic shock is to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate treatment. Therefore, drawing blood cultures should be the first action. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible after obtaining cultures to target the infection. Fluid resuscitation is critical to address the vasodilation and decreased preload associated with sepsis. Oxygen therapy is essential to correct hypoxemia and improve tissue oxygenation. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess kidney perfusion and response to fluid resuscitation. Vasopressors should be considered if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate MAP.",
