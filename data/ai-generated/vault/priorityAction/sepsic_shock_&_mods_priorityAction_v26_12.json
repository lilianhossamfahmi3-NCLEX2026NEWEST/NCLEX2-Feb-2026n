He was brought in by ambulance from a nursing home after being found unresponsive with a fever. Current vital signs (14:00): BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 122 bpm, RR 32 bpm and labored, SpO2 89% on room air, Temp 39.5°C (103.1°F). The patient is lethargic and oriented only to name. Skin is warm and flushed. Urine output has been minimal over the past 2 hours (20 mL total). Current lab results (14:00) show: WBC 18,000/µL, Lactate 4.5 mmol/L, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL. The patient has a central line and a Foley catheter in place. The provider was notified, and orders were received. Antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) are prescribed. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids is also ordered. Oxygen therapy is initiated via nasal cannula at 6L/min. The SBAR and MAR are available for review.",

            "correct": "Drawing blood cultures is the priority in septic shock to identify the causative organism before initiating antibiotic treatment. This ensures appropriate antibiotic selection and targeted therapy. Administering prescribed antibiotics should follow immediately after obtaining blood cultures to combat the infection. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids is crucial to address vasodilation and decreased preload, improving blood pressure and organ perfusion. Titrating oxygen to maintain SpO2 >95% is essential to correct hypoxemia and ensure adequate tissue oxygenation. Monitoring urine output hourly helps assess kidney perfusion and the client's response to fluid resuscitation. Administering vasopressors is considered if hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and support organ perfusion.",
