She presented to the unit at 14:00 with ruptured membranes.\nB: Her prenatal course was uncomplicated. She tested positive for Group B Streptococcus. She was planning for a vaginal delivery. Continuous fetal monitoring was initiated upon arrival. Her vital signs have been stable.\nA: At 14:45, a sudden drop in fetal heart rate to 70 bpm was noted, accompanied by moderate vaginal bleeding. Vaginal exam revealed a prolapsed umbilical cord. The fetal heart rate remains in the 70s. Ms. Silver is anxious and reports feeling pressure. Contractions are occurring every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds.\nR: I recommend immediate intervention to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord and prepare for an emergency cesarean section. Please provide orders for oxygen administration, IV fluids, and notification of the surgical team. I will continue to monitor the fetal heart rate and maternal vital signs closely. The time is now 14:50."

    "correct": "The priority action in the event of a prolapsed umbilical cord is to relieve pressure on the cord to restore fetal oxygenation. Inserting two gloved fingers into the vagina and elevating the presenting part (fetal head or buttocks) off the umbilical cord is the most immediate and effective way to accomplish this. This action reduces cord compression, allowing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus to resume. Maintaining this position is crucial until the baby is delivered via cesarean section. Failure to act immediately can result in fetal hypoxia and potential neurological damage or fetal demise.",
    "incorrect": "Administering oxygen is important but secondary to relieving cord compression. While oxygen can help increase maternal oxygen saturation and potentially improve fetal oxygenation, it does not directly address the primary problem of cord compression. Preparing for induction is contraindicated in the presence of cord prolapse. Induction would further compress the cord as the fetus descends. The client needs an emergency C-section. Placing the client in Trendelenburg or knee-chest position can help reduce cord compression by gravity, but it is less effective and slower than manual elevation of the presenting part. It should be used as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, manual elevation.",
