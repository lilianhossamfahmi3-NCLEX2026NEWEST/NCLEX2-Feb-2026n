      "content": "**S**ituation: Client with SVT, HR 180 bpm, awake, oriented, BP 118/72 mmHg.\n**B**ackground: SVT is a re-entrant tachycardia, often involving the AV node. Hemodynamic stability indicates no immediate organ compromise.\n**A**ssessment: Client is stable (BP, mentation). Initial intervention should be least invasive.\n**R**ecommendation: Instruct the client to perform the Valsalva maneuver. This vagal maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure, stimulating baroreceptors and slowing AV node conduction. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure. This reduces venous return and cardiac output, triggering a compensatory sympathetic response. Upon release, venous return surges, stretching the right atrium and stimulating a powerful parasympathetic (vagal) response. The vagus nerve releases acetylcholine, slowing conduction through the AV node and potentially terminating the re-entrant circuit. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** The Valsalva maneuver is a safe, non-pharmacologic first-line intervention for stable SVT. Ensure the client understands the instructions and monitor their response closely. Document the time (e.g., 1400) and the client's response."

Cardioversion is used for unstable patients.\n**A**ssessment: Client is stable (BP, mentation). Cardioversion is invasive and carries risks.\n**R**ecommendation: Cardioversion is NOT the initial action for a stable patient. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Synchronized cardioversion delivers a timed electrical shock to interrupt the dysrhythmia. It's reserved for hemodynamically unstable patients (hypotension, altered mental status, shock) because of the risks associated with sedation and the procedure itself. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Cardioversion is indicated for unstable SVT. Signs of instability include hypotension (e.g., SBP <90 mmHg), altered mental status, chest pain, or signs of heart failure.

Vagal maneuvers should be attempted first.\n**R**ecommendation: Attempt vagal maneuvers BEFORE administering adenosine. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Adenosine blocks AV nodal conduction, interrupting the re-entrant circuit. While effective, it causes transient side effects like flushing, chest pressure, and dyspnea. Vagal maneuvers are less invasive and should be tried first. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Adenosine is the first-line *medication* for stable SVT, but vagal maneuvers are the first *action*. Be prepared for transient asystole after adenosine administration. Document the time (e.g., 1400) and the rationale for not choosing this option.",

Carotid sinus massage carries risks and is performed by qualified providers.\n**R**ecommendation: Carotid sinus massage is NOT within the RN's scope of practice in many settings and carries risks. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Carotid sinus massage stimulates baroreceptors, triggering a vagal response. However, it can dislodge plaque, causing stroke, or induce severe bradycardia/asystole. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Carotid sinus massage is contraindicated in patients with carotid bruits or a history of stroke/TIA. It requires careful monitoring and is typically performed by a physician or advanced practice provider. Document the time (e.g., 1400) and the rationale for not choosing this option.",
