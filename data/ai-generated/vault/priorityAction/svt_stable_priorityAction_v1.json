            "content": "This action, known as the Valsalva maneuver, is the correct first-line, non-pharmacologic intervention for a hemodynamically stable client with SVT. Instructing the client to bear down dramatically increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure. This pressure compresses the great vessels, initially decreasing venous return to the heart and thus cardiac output. Baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus detect this drop in pressure and trigger a compensatory sympathetic surge. When the client relaxes, the pressure is released, causing a sudden surge of venous return to a now less-filled heart. This stretches the right atrium and stimulates a powerful reflex parasympathetic (vagal) response. The vagus nerve releases acetylcholine, which intensely slows conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, interrupting the re-entrant circuit that is the underlying cause of most SVTs and allowing the sinus node to resume its role as the primary pacemaker."

                "content": "Synchronized cardioversion delivers a timed electrical current to terminate a tachyarrhythmia. It is a high-risk procedure reserved for clients who are hemodynamically unstable (e.g., hypotensive, showing signs of shock, altered mental status, acute heart failure). This client's blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg and normal orientation indicate hemodynamic stability. Subjecting a stable client to cardioversion and the required procedural sedation poses unnecessary risks, such as adverse reactions to anesthetic agents, skin burns, and post-shock dysrhythmias. The principle of 'least invasive first' dictates that vagal maneuvers and pharmacologic options should be exhausted before considering electrical therapy in a stable patient."

                "content": "Adenosine is the first-line medication for stable SVT, but it is not the initial *action*. Adenosine works by binding to A1 purinergic receptors in the AV node, causing transient hyperpolarization and a complete, but very brief, block of AV nodal conduction. This effectively 'resets' the electrical pathway, terminating the re-entrant tachycardia. However, clinical guidelines (e.g., ACLS) prioritize attempting non-invasive vagal maneuvers first. Vagal maneuvers are safer, can be performed immediately without needing IV access, and avoid the significant, albeit temporary, side effects of adenosine, which include profound flushing, dyspnea, chest pressure, and a sense of impending doom due to the induced asystole. If vagal maneuvers fail, adenosine is the appropriate next step."

                "content": "Carotid sinus massage is a type of vagal maneuver but is outside the scope of practice for a registered nurse and is performed only by a qualified provider (e.g., physician, APRN). The carotid sinus contains baroreceptors that, when stimulated by gentle pressure, trigger a reflex vagal response to slow the heart rate. However, this procedure carries a significant risk of dislodging atherosclerotic plaque from the carotid artery, potentially causing an embolic stroke (CVA). It can also induce profound bradycardia or asystole. Therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with carotid bruits, a history of stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Due to these risks and the required expertise, it is not an action the nurse should perform."

    "questionTrap": "The primary trap in this scenario is distinguishing between the management of stable versus unstable tachycardia and applying the principle of 'least invasive first'. Candidates may incorrectly select adenosine because it is the first-line *drug*, or cardioversion because it is a definitive treatment, without recognizing that the client's hemodynamic stability (BP 118/72, A&O) makes non-invasive vagal maneuvers the appropriate initial action. The NCLEX tests the nurse's ability to sequence interventions correctly based on a thorough assessment of patient stability.",
