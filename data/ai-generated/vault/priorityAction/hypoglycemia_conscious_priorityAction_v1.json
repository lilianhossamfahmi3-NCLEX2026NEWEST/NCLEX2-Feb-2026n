The client is experiencing symptomatic hypoglycemia, a state of neuroglycopenia where the brain is deprived of its primary fuel source, glucose. The symptoms of trembling (autonomic response from epinephrine release) and lightheadedness (neuroglycopenic symptom) confirm a physiological crisis. Fast-acting carbohydrates (monosaccharides like glucose or fructose) are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract directly into the bloodstream, providing the quickest possible elevation in blood glucose to restore cerebral function and prevent progression to seizure or coma."

            "option_2": {
                "content": "This action is incorrect as the *first* step. Complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) and proteins require enzymatic digestion before they are absorbed, a process that is too slow to reverse acute, symptomatic hypoglycemia. Administering these first would dangerously delay the necessary rapid rise in blood glucose, allowing neuroglycopenia to worsen. A snack with complex carbohydrates and protein is appropriate only *after* the blood glucose has been stabilized above 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) to prevent a recurrent drop."

            "option_3": {
                "content": "This action is incorrect and unsafe. Delaying treatment to retest in 30 minutes ignores a confirmed, symptomatic hypoglycemic event. The rate of glucose decline can be precipitous, and a 30-minute delay could allow the client's neurological status to deteriorate significantly, potentially leading to loss of consciousness or seizures. The standard evidence-based protocol (Rule of 15) requires immediate treatment, followed by a recheck in 15 minutes to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness."

                "content": "This action is incorrect for this client's presentation. Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis (the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose). Its use is reserved for severe hypoglycemia where the client is unconscious, unable to swallow safely, or otherwise cannot take oral glucose. Because this client is conscious and able to report symptoms, oral administration is the safer, faster, and preferred route. Glucagon can also cause vomiting, which could complicate subsequent oral intake."
