He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nBackground: J.B. was started on IV fluids yesterday, but his urine output remains minimal. He reports generalized weakness and nausea.\n\nAssessment: At 07:00, J.B. became increasingly restless and complained of palpitations. Vitals: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 38 bpm and irregular, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C (99.0°F). Cardiac monitor shows peaked T waves. Labs: Potassium 7.2 mEq/L (critical high). Sodium 138 mEq/L, BUN 60 mg/dL, Creatinine 3.5 mg/dL. Physical Exam: Noted muscle twitching and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Lungs clear to auscultation.\n\nRecommendation: I am concerned about J.B.'s hyperkalemia and symptomatic bradycardia. I recommend immediate treatment to stabilize his cardiac function and prevent further complications. Consider repeating potassium level after treatment."

    "correct": "Calcium gluconate is the priority because it directly antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart, stabilizing the cardiac membrane and preventing life-threatening arrhythmias. Given the patient's symptomatic bradycardia (HR 38 bpm) and peaked T waves on the cardiac monitor, immediate administration is crucial. The standing order allows for immediate action without delay.",
    "incorrect": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is a potassium-binding resin that helps eliminate potassium from the body through the stool. While it is an important treatment for hyperkalemia, it is not the priority in an acute, symptomatic situation. It takes several hours to have an effect and is not suitable for immediate stabilization of cardiac function.\n\nContinuous cardiac monitoring is essential for detecting and documenting arrhythmias, but it does not address the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia or immediately stabilize the cardiac membrane. It is a supportive measure, not the priority intervention.\n\nWhile an ECG is a useful diagnostic tool to assess the extent of cardiac involvement in hyperkalemia, obtaining one is not the priority action. The patient's symptoms (bradycardia, peaked T waves) and potassium level (7.2 mEq/L) already indicate a critical situation requiring immediate intervention to protect the heart. Delaying treatment to obtain an ECG could have life-threatening consequences.",
