  "answerBreakdown": {
    "optionA": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Stopping the transfusion immediately is the priority. The client's symptoms (fever, chills, back pain) strongly suggest an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR). AHTR is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction where the recipient's antibodies attack donor red blood cells (RBCs). This causes massive intravascular hemolysis, releasing inflammatory cytokines, free hemoglobin, and procoagulants. Continuing the transfusion worsens the reaction, potentially leading to shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute kidney injury.  Stopping the transfusion limits further exposure to the incompatible RBCs. **Clinical Pearl:** Back pain during a transfusion is a red flag for AHTR and requires immediate intervention."
    },
    "optionB": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Notifying the provider and blood bank is important, but delaying stopping the transfusion can have devastating consequences. While communication is vital, the immediate priority is to halt the source of the reaction.  Each minute the transfusion continues, more RBCs are destroyed, exacerbating the inflammatory response and increasing the risk of organ damage. **Pathophysiology:** The release of free hemoglobin overwhelms the kidneys' ability to process it, leading to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure.  Procoagulants activate the coagulation cascade, leading to microthrombi formation and consumption of clotting factors, resulting in DIC."
    },
    "optionC": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Diphenhydramine is used for allergic reactions (Type I hypersensitivity), which present with urticaria, pruritus, and wheezing. While chills can occur in both allergic and hemolytic reactions, back pain is more indicative of hemolysis. Administering diphenhydramine will not address the underlying hemolytic process and wastes valuable time. **Pathophysiology:** Allergic reactions involve IgE antibodies binding to mast cells and basophils, causing histamine release. AHTR involves IgG or IgM antibodies directly attacking RBCs, leading to complement activation and cell lysis."
    },
    "optionD": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Infusing normal saline through the same tubing is dangerous. The tubing contains incompatible donor blood. Flushing it with saline will push the remaining RBCs into the client's circulation, worsening the AHTR. This can cause a rapid drop in blood pressure and accelerate the progression to shock and renal failure. **Clinical Pearl:** Always use new tubing for normal saline infusion after stopping a blood transfusion. **Pathophysiology:** The bolus of incompatible RBCs further overwhelms the body's compensatory mechanisms, leading to increased inflammation, hemolysis, and organ damage."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Priority vs. Importance Trap",
    "details": "This question traps test-takers who prioritize important actions (notification) over the immediate life-saving intervention (stopping the transfusion). The NCLEX emphasizes identifying the action with the most immediate positive impact. In AHTR, halting the transfusion is paramount to prevent further harm. Recognizing the signs of AHTR and acting decisively are crucial for patient safety."
