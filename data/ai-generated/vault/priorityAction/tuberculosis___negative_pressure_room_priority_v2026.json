Patient reports a persistent cough for three weeks, night sweats, and recent weight loss of 15 pounds. Temperature is 38.2°C, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in the upper lobes bilaterally. The patient is currently in a standard medical room. He appears anxious and is asking about his diagnosis and potential isolation procedures. The physician has been notified and is en route. Isoniazid (INH) 300mg PO daily has been prescribed STAT. The patient needs immediate placement in a negative pressure room to prevent potential spread of the infection. He needs education and emotional support once transferred. Consider further diagnostic testing, including sputum cultures."

    "correct": "The client's symptoms and preliminary diagnosis strongly suggest tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an airborne infectious disease. The priority is to prevent the spread of infection to others. Transferring the client to a negative pressure room immediately isolates the client and contains the airborne particles, preventing further transmission. This action takes precedence over medication administration, education, or further diagnostic testing because it directly addresses the immediate risk of infection spread. Negative pressure rooms are specifically designed to contain airborne pathogens, making this the most crucial initial step.",
    "incorrect": "Administering isoniazid is important for treating tuberculosis, but it is not the immediate priority. The medication will take time to become effective, and until then, the client remains infectious. Educating the client is important, but should be done after the client is safely isolated in a negative pressure room. Collecting a sputum sample is necessary for confirming the diagnosis, but it is not the priority action. Delaying isolation increases the risk of exposing others to the infection.",
