B: History includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, otherwise healthy. Hip replacement was uneventful. He has been recovering well until this morning. A: At 07:00, routine labs revealed a significant drop in platelet count from 250,000/μL on admission to 90,000/μL today. Patient denies any bleeding or bruising. Vitals are stable: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F). He is alert and oriented. I am concerned about possible Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). R: I recommend immediate discontinuation of heparin, HIT antibody testing, and initiation of an alternative anticoagulant. Please advise. 07:15: Notified provider of platelet drop."

    "correct": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a significant drop in platelet count following heparin administration. The immediate priority is to discontinue the heparin infusion to prevent further platelet activation and thrombosis. Delaying this action could lead to severe thromboembolic complications such as DVT, pulmonary embolism, or stroke. Notifying the provider is crucial for further management, including ordering HIT antibody testing and initiating alternative anticoagulation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering platelets is generally contraindicated in HIT because it can paradoxically worsen thrombosis. Assessing for DVT is important, but it is secondary to stopping the heparin. Continuing the heparin while monitoring platelets would be dangerous and could lead to life-threatening complications.",
