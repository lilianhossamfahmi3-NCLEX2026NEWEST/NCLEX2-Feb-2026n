Background: J.M. was admitted 24 hours ago and started on a CIWA protocol. He has been increasingly restless and verbally aggressive throughout the shift. Assessment: At 14:00, J.M. began pacing in his room, yelling loudly, and throwing objects. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR 24, SpO2 98% on room air. He is diaphoretic and appears extremely anxious. He is making threatening statements towards staff. The nurse attempted verbal de-escalation for 10 minutes without success. He is now banging on the door and demanding to leave. He states, \"I'm going to hurt someone if you don't let me out!\" He is exhibiting signs of acute alcohol withdrawal and escalating aggression. The last dose of lorazepam was given 4 hours ago. Recommendation: Immediate intervention is required to ensure the safety of J.M., other patients, and staff. Request STAT evaluation by the psychiatric team and security assistance. Consider additional medication if de-escalation fails. Notify the provider of the situation and obtain further orders."

    "correct": "The client's escalating aggression and direct threat of violence necessitate immediate security intervention. The safety of the client, staff, and other patients is the top priority. Security personnel are trained to manage violent situations and can provide the necessary support to prevent harm. Delaying this action could result in injury to individuals in the vicinity or further escalation of the client's behavior, creating a more dangerous environment. Hospital policy typically dictates security involvement in such situations. Addressing the immediate threat is paramount, even if other interventions are also necessary. Failure to act decisively could lead to legal ramifications if someone is harmed.",
    "incorrect": "Administering medication (b) is a reasonable intervention, but it is not the FIRST action. Medication may take time to take effect, and the immediate threat of violence must be addressed first. Verbal de-escalation (c) has already been attempted without success, and the client's behavior is escalating, indicating that it is unlikely to be effective at this point. Documentation (d) is essential, but it is not the priority when there is an imminent risk of violence. Documentation should occur after the immediate safety concerns have been addressed.",
