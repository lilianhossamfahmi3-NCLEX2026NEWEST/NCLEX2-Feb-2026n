The client's current ventilator settings are: FiO2 60%, Tidal Volume 450 mL, Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min, PEEP 10 cm H2O. The client is receiving continuous IV sedation with propofol. Review the EHR and determine what action is MOST important to take.",

            "SBAR": "Situation: 68-year-old male with ARDS secondary to sepsis, mechanically ventilated. Background: Admitted 3 days ago for sepsis. PMH includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Assessment: At 07:00, BP is 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 16 (vent), SpO2 90%, ETCO2 38 mmHg, Temp 38.5°C. ABG from 06:00 shows pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Lungs have diffuse crackles bilaterally. The patient is on propofol for sedation. Current vent settings: FiO2 60%, TV 450mL, RR 16, PEEP 10. At 07:15, the patient is noted to have increased agitation despite sedation. Tube placement is confirmed with equal breath sounds bilaterally and ETCO2 in range. Recommendation: Assess for potential causes of agitation. Consider increasing sedation, but monitor for hypotension. Evaluate for other causes of respiratory distress. Assess ABGs and consider vent changes.",

            "correct": "The client is hypotensive and hypoxemic with signs of increasing agitation. The ABG reveals respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, indicating the current ventilator settings are not adequate to meet the client's needs. Administering a bolus of normal saline is crucial to address the hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg), which can impair oxygen delivery to tissues. Increasing the PEEP to 12 cm H2O can improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and increasing gas exchange. While increasing FiO2 might seem logical, the client is already at 60%, and increasing it further without addressing PEEP and fluid balance could lead to oxygen toxicity. Increasing propofol may further exacerbate hypotension.",

                "optionA": "Increasing FiO2 alone, while seemingly beneficial, does not address the underlying alveolar collapse and can lead to oxygen toxicity at high concentrations for prolonged periods. The client is already at 60% FiO2; addressing PEEP is a higher priority.",
                "optionD": "Increasing the propofol infusion rate will further decrease BP due to the vasodilation effects of the drug.
