His wife reports that approximately 90 minutes ago (around 12:45), she noticed him suddenly develop slurred speech and weakness on his right side. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with medications. \n\nB: Patient was at baseline this morning. No recent illnesses or injuries. His vital signs upon arrival were BP 180/100 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 20, SpO2 97% on room air. Initial GCS was 13 (E3, V4, M6).\n\nA: Patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with an acute stroke, specifically left-sided cerebral event. NIHSS score is 15. CT scan of the head is pending. The patient complains of a headache rated 4/10. Speech is markedly slurred. Right-sided weakness is evident. Dysphagia screening has not yet been performed.\n\nR: I recommend immediate neurological consultation and consideration for thrombolytic therapy (alteplase) if the CT scan rules out hemorrhage. Blood pressure needs to be controlled per stroke protocol. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is crucial. Prepare for dysphagia screening. Repeat NIHSS after intervention."

    "correct": "The patient presents with acute stroke symptoms, and the CT scan rules out hemorrhage, making the patient a candidate for alteplase (tPA). Given the time-sensitive nature of tPA administration (ideally within 3 hours of symptom onset, but up to 4.5 hours in some cases), the priority is to prepare for and administer the medication as quickly as possible to improve the chances of neurological recovery. Verifying the order with another nurse is a standard safety protocol before high-risk medication administration.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is a lower priority than addressing the underlying stroke. While the patient reports a headache, it is not the immediate threat to life or long-term function. ECG is not the priority action; while cardiac issues can mimic stroke symptoms, the CT scan has already ruled out hemorrhage, and the focus should be on treating the stroke. Foley catheter insertion is not the priority. While monitoring urine output is important, it is not as crucial as initiating thrombolytic therapy in the acute phase of stroke management. It can also increase the risk of infection.",
