Placing the client in a high-Fowler position (sitting upright at 90 degrees) immediately leverages orthostatic hypotension. This position causes gravitational pooling of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation, which decreases venous return to the heart. The reduction in preload leads to a decrease in cardiac output and a subsequent rapid, non-pharmacological lowering of blood pressure. This action directly mitigates the immediate risk of a hemorrhagic stroke or seizure while the nurse proceeds to identify and remove the underlying noxious stimulus."

The client's blood pressure is dangerously high, posing an imminent risk of stroke. The assessment process to find the cause takes more time than immediately repositioning the client. The priority is to lower the blood pressure as quickly as possible; positioning achieves this within seconds, whereas finding and relieving the bladder distention may take minutes."

Pharmacological intervention is not the first step because it takes time to acquire and administer the medication. Furthermore, if the underlying stimulus is removed while the antihypertensive is taking effect, the sympathetic surge will cease, potentially causing severe rebound hypotension as the drug's vasodilatory effect becomes unopposed. The primary nursing actions should always be attempted first."

Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency requiring immediate, independent nursing interventions that are within the nurse's scope of practice. Delaying life-saving actions like repositioning the client to make a phone call allows the severe hypertension to persist, increasing the risk of end-organ damage, particularly a cerebrovascular accident. The nurse must act first to stabilize the client and then notify the provider."

Candidates often correctly identify that a full bladder is the likely cause and want to fix it immediately. However, the NCLEX tests for the *first* and *most important* action to ensure client safety. With a BP of 190/100 mmHg, the imminent danger is a stroke. Positioning the client upright is the fastest way to lower the BP and mitigate this risk, making it the top priority before investigating the cause."
