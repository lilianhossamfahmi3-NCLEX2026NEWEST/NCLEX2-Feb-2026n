Pre-existing conditions include hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was stable until approximately 30 minutes ago.\n\nA: 07:00: Patient reports sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. Auscultation reveals muffled heart sounds. Blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 bpm, and respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min with increased work of breathing. Oxygen saturation is 90% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. A paradoxical pulse is noted on palpation. Based on the constellation of findings – hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension – cardiac tamponade is highly suspected. \n\nR: I recommend immediate evaluation for cardiac tamponade and preparation for pericardiocentesis. I have already placed him on a cardiac monitor and increased his oxygen to 6L via nasal cannula. I will continue to monitor vital signs closely and await further orders."

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to relieve pressure on the heart.

While other actions are important, preparing for pericardiocentesis is the priority.",

Notifying the provider is essential, but preparing for pericardiocentesis should occur simultaneously, as this is the definitive treatment for cardiac tamponade. Delaying treatment can lead to rapid deterioration and death.",
