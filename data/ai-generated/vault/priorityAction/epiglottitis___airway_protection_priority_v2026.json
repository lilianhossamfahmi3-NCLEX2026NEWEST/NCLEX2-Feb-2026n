His oral examination reveals significant swelling of the epiglottis. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. He is increasingly agitated and unable to lie down. Retractions are noted at the suprasternal notch. Current respiratory rate is 40 and labored. Heart rate is 150 bpm. Temperature is 104°F (40°C) rectally. 14:15: The patient appears increasingly fatigued and cyanotic around the lips."

    "correct": "Epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive infection that can cause complete airway obstruction, particularly in young children. The patient's presentation (drooling, stridor, tripod positioning, and low oxygen saturation) indicates severe respiratory distress and imminent airway compromise. The priority is to secure the airway through endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Delaying this intervention could result in respiratory arrest and death. Pediatric ENT and Anesthesia are en route but the nurse must prepare for the procedure.",
    "incorrect": "Nebulized racemic epinephrine can help reduce upper airway edema, but in severe cases of epiglottitis, it may not be sufficient to prevent complete airway obstruction. Securing the airway is the priority.\nA chest X-ray may be useful in diagnosing other respiratory conditions, but in a patient with suspected epiglottitis, the priority is to secure the airway. Delaying airway management to obtain a chest X-ray could have fatal consequences.\nWhile IV access is important for administering fluids and medications, it is not the immediate priority in this situation. Securing the airway takes precedence over establishing IV access. The patient's immediate survival depends on maintaining a patent airway.",
