    "correct": "Dantrolene sodium is the specific antidote for malignant hyperthermia. It acts as a muscle relaxant by binding to the ryanodine receptor and decreasing the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus reducing muscle rigidity and slowing metabolism. Immediate administration is crucial to halt the progression of MH and improve patient outcomes. The faster dantrolene is administered, the better the prognosis. Every minute counts in this emergency.",
    "incorrect": "Applying ice packs is a supportive measure to help reduce the patient's temperature, but it is not the priority action. Dantrolene addresses the underlying cause of MH. \n\nAdministering 100% oxygen is important to address the patient's increased metabolic demands and potential hypoxemia, but it does not treat the underlying cause of MH. \n\nNotifying the anesthesia provider is important for communication and collaboration, but it delays the administration of the critical intervention, dantrolene.",
