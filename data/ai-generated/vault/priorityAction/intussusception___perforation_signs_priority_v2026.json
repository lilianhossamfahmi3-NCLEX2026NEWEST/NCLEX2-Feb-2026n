    "correct": "The sudden onset of abdominal distension, rigidity, tenderness, absent bowel sounds, and guarding in a child with intussusception suggests a possible perforation. Perforation is a life-threatening complication that requires immediate medical intervention. Notifying the healthcare provider promptly is crucial for initiating timely treatment, which may include surgical intervention and antibiotics, to prevent sepsis and further complications.",
    "incorrect": "Administering ondansetron addresses the symptom of nausea but does not address the underlying critical issue of potential perforation. While managing nausea is important for patient comfort, it is secondary to addressing a potentially life-threatening complication.\n\nDocumenting findings and monitoring the child every two hours is inadequate given the acute change in the child's condition and the high suspicion of perforation. Continuous monitoring is important, but taking immediate action to inform the healthcare provider is the priority.\n\nPreparing for an abdominal X-ray may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it delays the immediate action of notifying the healthcare provider about the suspected perforation. In this case, the clinical signs warrant immediate notification, and imaging studies can be ordered concurrently.",
