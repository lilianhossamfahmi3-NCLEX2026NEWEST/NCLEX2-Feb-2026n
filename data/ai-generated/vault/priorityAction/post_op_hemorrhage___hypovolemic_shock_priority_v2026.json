B: The patient's medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis. He received routine post-operative analgesia and was tolerating a regular diet. Recent labs were within normal limits. A: At 08:30, the patient reported feeling dizzy and nauseous. Upon assessment, his BP is 82/50 mmHg, HR is 122 bpm, RR is 24, SpO2 92% on room air. The surgical dressing is saturated with blood, and there is a noticeable amount of blood pooling under the patient. The patient is pale and diaphoretic. He states, \"I feel like I'm going to pass out.\" Urine output has decreased to 10 mL in the last hour. R: I am concerned about possible post-operative hemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock. I recommend immediate intervention to stabilize his condition. Consider ordering stat labs (CBC, coagulation studies), increasing IV fluid rate, and preparing for possible blood transfusion. Patient requires immediate evaluation by the surgical team."

    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting classic signs of hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, and decreased urine output) likely due to post-operative hemorrhage. Calling a Rapid Response Team is the priority because it immediately brings a team of experts to assess and manage the patient's deteriorating condition. This ensures timely and coordinated interventions to stabilize the patient and prevent further decompensation. Rapid Response Teams are equipped to handle acute medical emergencies, providing advanced interventions and potentially preventing a code situation. Delaying this action could lead to severe consequences, including organ damage or death.",
    "incorrect": [
      "Increasing IV fluids is an appropriate intervention for hypovolemic shock but is secondary to calling for expert help. The rate needs to be determined by the provider based on the patient’s condition and response to initial interventions. Rapid fluid administration without proper assessment can be harmful.",
      "Administering an antiemetic addresses the patient's nausea but does not address the underlying problem of hypovolemic shock. Addressing the shock is the priority, as nausea is a symptom of the more critical condition.",
      "Elevating the legs and administering oxygen are helpful interventions for hypovolemic shock but are not the priority. These actions can improve venous return and oxygenation but do not address the immediate need for expert evaluation and management of the hemorrhage and shock."
