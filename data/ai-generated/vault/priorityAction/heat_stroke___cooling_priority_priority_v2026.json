Bystanders reported he appeared confused and disoriented before falling. B: Mr. James has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He also has a history of mild chronic kidney disease. He denies any allergies. R: On arrival, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli but responds to painful stimuli. His initial vital signs were: HR 130 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28 breaths/min and labored, SpO2 92% on room air, and temperature 105.8°F (41°C). GCS is 8. A: The patient is exhibiting signs of heat stroke, including hyperthermia, altered mental status, and hypotension. Immediate cooling measures and fluid resuscitation are necessary. Intubation may be required to protect the airway."

    "correct": "Rapid cooling is the priority in heat stroke to prevent organ damage and death. Applying ice packs to areas with large blood vessels (groin, axillae) and using a cooling blanket facilitates rapid heat transfer and lowers the core temperature quickly. This intervention addresses the immediate life-threatening hyperthermia.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is ineffective for heat stroke, as it does not address the underlying mechanism of heat gain exceeding heat loss. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate in an unresponsive patient due to the risk of aspiration. Moving the patient to a shaded area and removing clothing is a basic first step, but it is insufficient to rapidly lower the core temperature in heat stroke. These actions alone will not prevent further complications.",
