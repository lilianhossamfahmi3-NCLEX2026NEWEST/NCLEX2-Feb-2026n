The client is in an Addisonian crisis, a state of acute adrenal insufficiency characterized by profound glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency. The life-threatening hypotension (82/46 mmHg) is due to both volume depletion (from aldosterone deficiency causing sodium/water wasting) and decreased vascular tone (from cortisol deficiency reducing sensitivity to catecholamines). IV hydrocortisone provides immediate replacement of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. This action directly addresses the root cause of the crisis by restoring vascular tone, promoting sodium/water retention, and facilitating potassium excretion, thereby stabilizing the client's hemodynamic status."

Insulin temporarily shifts potassium into the cells via the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, but it does not correct the underlying aldosterone deficiency causing the potassium retention. More critically, administering insulin to a client who is already borderline hypoglycemic (65 mg/dL) without concurrent dextrose administration would induce severe, potentially fatal hypoglycemia and worsen the client's confusion and lethargy."

The root cause of the crisis is adrenal failure, and only steroid replacement can reverse the cascade of hemodynamic and metabolic collapse.

First, its onset of action is extremely slow (several hours to days), making it useless for correcting the immediate cardiac risk posed by a potassium of 6.8 mEq/L. Second, it does not address the underlying adrenal insufficiency causing the hemodynamic instability. The priority is rapid stabilization with IV fluids and steroids."

Aldosterone deficiency leads to massive renal wasting of sodium and water, causing severe hypovolemia, and retention of potassium, causing hyperkalemia. Cortisol deficiency exacerbates hypotension by decreasing vascular sensitivity to circulating catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine), leading to distributive shock. It also impairs gluconeogenesis, resulting in hypoglycemia. The combination of hypovolemic and distributive shock causes cardiovascular collapse, while severe hyperkalemia poses an imminent risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.",

Test-takers may be drawn to treating the most alarming lab value—the critical hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L)—with its classic treatment, insulin. However, this ignores the overarching diagnosis of Addisonian crisis, where the entire clinical picture (hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia) points to adrenal failure. The priority is to replace the missing hormones (steroids) which will begin to correct all the associated abnormalities, especially the life-threatening shock state.",

The most critical 'S' to administer first is Steroids to reverse the shock.",
