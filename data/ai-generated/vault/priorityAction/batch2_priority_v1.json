Histamine binds to H1 receptors, causing vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus production. The vasodilation and increased capillary permeability lead to a rapid shift of fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space, resulting in severe hypotension and distributive shock. Leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors and contribute to airway edema. The combined effects of these mediators cause smooth muscle contraction in the airways, leading to bronchospasm and life-threatening laryngeal edema (stridor).

Fundal massage provides direct mechanical stimulation to these muscle fibers, triggering the release of local prostaglandins, increasing intracellular calcium, and causing muscle contraction. This contraction physically constricts the open blood vessels, providing immediate hemostasis. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Uterine atony occurs when the uterus fails to contract adequately after childbirth. This can be due to factors like overdistension of the uterus (multiple gestation, polyhydramnios), prolonged labor, grand multiparity, use of certain medications (magnesium sulfate), or infection. Without adequate contraction, the blood vessels at the placental site remain open, leading to significant blood loss.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Fundal massage should be performed using a two-handed approach. One hand stabilizes the lower uterine segment while the other hand massages the fundus in a circular motion. The nurse should also express any clots that may have accumulated in the uterus.",

This process activates the complement cascade, releasing inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) that cause fever and chills. The back pain results from hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria, as free hemoglobin precipitates in the renal tubules, causing acute tubular necrosis and kidney injury. Immediately stopping the transfusion is the only action that halts the introduction of the causative agent (incompatible RBCs), thereby limiting the extent of hemolysis and the subsequent systemic inflammatory response that can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and shock.

Administering an antihistamine provides no benefit for hemolysis and wastes critical time that should be spent stopping the infusion and initiating supportive care. Pathophysiology: AHTR involves complement activation and cytokine release, leading to systemic inflammation and end-organ damage. Antihistamines do not address these mechanisms.

Candidates may be drawn to options C and D because they are the 'cures' for the condition. However, the fundamental principle of emergency care, ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), must always be applied first. A compromised airway is the most immediate threat to life. The correct answer prioritizes preventing anoxic brain injury over initiating pharmacologic therapy or definitive surgical intervention."

The priority is immediate hormone replacement with IV hydrocortisone. The profound hypotension (82/46 mmHg) results from aldosterone deficiency (causing sodium and water loss, leading to hypovolemia) and cortisol deficiency (reducing vascular tone and responsiveness to catecholamines). Hydrocortisone addresses both deficiencies, restoring vascular tone, promoting sodium/water retention, and facilitating potassium excretion, thus stabilizing hemodynamics.

Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly via the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, but it doesn't address the underlying aldosterone deficiency causing potassium retention. More critically, administering insulin to a client who is already hypoglycemic (65 mg/dL) without dextrose could induce severe hypoglycemia, worsening confusion and lethargy.

Dextrose alone will not raise blood pressure or lower potassium. The root cause is adrenal failure, requiring steroid replacement to reverse the hemodynamic and metabolic collapse. ClinicalPearl: In Addisonian crisis, think 'hormones first' to address the underlying pathophysiology, then manage secondary issues like hypoglycemia."

      "d": {
        "isCorrect": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate removes potassium via the GI tract. It's inappropriate for an acute crisis due to its slow onset (hours to days), making it ineffective for immediate cardiac risk from hyperkalemia. It also doesn't address the underlying adrenal insufficiency causing hemodynamic instability. The priority is rapid stabilization with IV fluids and steroids. ClinicalPearl: Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is useful for chronic hyperkalemia management, not acute emergencies."
      }
    },
    "pathophysiology": "Addisonian crisis is triggered by a sudden drop in cortisol and aldosterone levels. Aldosterone deficiency leads to sodium and water loss, causing hypovolemia and hypotension. The decreased blood volume reduces venous return, cardiac output, and blood pressure. The kidneys respond by releasing renin, leading to angiotensin II and further vasoconstriction, but this is insufficient to maintain adequate blood pressure. Hyperkalemia results from decreased potassium excretion by the kidneys. Cortisol deficiency reduces vascular sensitivity to catecholamines, exacerbating hypotension and leading to distributive shock. Impaired gluconeogenesis causes hypoglycemia. The combination of hypovolemic and distributive shock leads to cardiovascular collapse. Severe hyperkalemia can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.",

Test-takers may be drawn to treating the most alarming lab value—hyperkalemia—with insulin. However, this ignores the overarching diagnosis of Addisonian crisis, where the entire clinical picture points to adrenal failure. The priority is to replace the missing hormones (steroids), which will begin to correct all associated abnormalities, especially the life-threatening shock state.",

The most critical 'S' to administer first is Steroids to reverse the shock.",

A C5 injury disrupts the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), leading to loss of vascular tone and massive peripheral vasodilation. This creates 'relative hypovolemia,' where the vascular space is too large for the circulating blood volume. Rapid IV fluid bolus (isotonic crystalloids like 0.9% NaCl or Lactated Ringer's) increases preload, cardiac output, and blood pressure to perfuse vital organs.

While atropine (an anticholinergic) may be used for symptomatic bradycardia, the root cause of hemodynamic instability is profound vasodilation, not the slow heart rate. The primary intervention must address the 'container' problem (vasodilation) with fluids before addressing the 'pump rate' with atropine. Correcting relative hypovolemia is the first step to restoring perfusion. ClinicalPearl: Atropine may be considered if bradycardia persists despite fluid resuscitation, but it's not the first-line treatment."
