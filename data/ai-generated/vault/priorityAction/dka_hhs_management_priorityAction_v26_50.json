She presents with increased thirst, frequent urination, abdominal pain, and a blood glucose level of 450 mg/dL. Vital signs include HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 with Kussmaul respirations, Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F), and SpO2 94% on room air. Labs show Na 130 mEq/L, K 5.8 mEq/L, Cl 98 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 35 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, Glucose 475 mg/dL, pH 7.25, pCO2 30 mmHg, and pO2 95 mmHg. Which action should the nurse prioritize?",

    "correct": "Initiating an IV infusion of normal saline is the priority action in DKA management due to significant dehydration from osmotic diuresis caused by hyperglycemia. Addressing the fluid deficit will improve perfusion and facilitate the correction of electrolyte imbalances and hyperglycemia. While insulin administration and electrolyte replacement are important, fluid resuscitation should precede them to prevent rapid shifts in electrolytes and cerebral edema.",
    "incorrect": "Administering intravenous insulin is important in DKA but not the immediate priority. Addressing dehydration with IV fluids is crucial first to prevent hypovolemic shock and to allow for better insulin absorption. Electrolyte replacement is essential to address electrolyte imbalances that occur with DKA but follows initial fluid resuscitation. Obtaining an arterial blood gas (ABG) is important for assessing the severity of DKA and guiding treatment, but it is not the immediate priority. Stabilizing the patient's fluid status is most important.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In DKA, always address dehydration first with IV fluids before administering insulin to prevent dangerous electrolyte shifts.",
      "Monitor potassium levels closely during DKA treatment, as insulin administration can cause hypokalemia.",
