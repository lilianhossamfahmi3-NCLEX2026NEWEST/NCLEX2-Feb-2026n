B: At 13:45, the patient became unresponsive and started exhibiting tonic-clonic movements. Prior to this, at 13:30, he was alert and oriented x3, complaining of a mild headache. His vital signs were stable. A: The patient is currently experiencing a generalized seizure. Oxygen saturation is dropping, now at 88%. Heart rate is elevated to 120 bpm, and blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg. Coarse crackles are auscultated bilaterally. R: I recommend immediate intervention to protect the patient from injury during the seizure. Assess for potential causes of the seizure activity. A neurological consult should be considered post-seizure. Consider STAT labs, including electrolytes and anticonvulsant levels (if applicable). Be prepared to administer benzodiazepines if the seizure does not resolve spontaneously. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation is crucial."
