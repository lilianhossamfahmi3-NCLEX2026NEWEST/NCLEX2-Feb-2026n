Ambulating with physical therapy this morning. A: Patient is now restless, with increased respiratory rate (32 breaths/min), SpO2 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing. New onset petechial rash noted on chest and axillae. Vitals: HR 110, BP 100/60, Temp 37.2°C (99°F). Patient is increasingly anxious. R: Suspect possible fat embolism. Request immediate evaluation and orders for respiratory support and further management. At 14:15, the patient's SpO2 dropped to 82%. Patient is now confused."

The immediate priority is to improve oxygenation. Administering high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is the most rapid way to increase the patient's SpO2 and address the hypoxia caused by the fat emboli obstructing pulmonary capillaries. This intervention directly targets the most life-threatening aspect of the situation.",

Notifying the surgeon is necessary, but only after ensuring the patient is stable and receiving adequate oxygenation. Increasing IV fluids might be considered later to support blood pressure, but it will not address the primary problem of impaired gas exchange and could potentially worsen pulmonary edema if the patient has underlying cardiac issues.",
