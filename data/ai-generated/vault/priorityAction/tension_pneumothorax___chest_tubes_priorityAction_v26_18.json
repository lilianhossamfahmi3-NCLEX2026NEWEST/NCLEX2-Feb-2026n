O: His vital signs are: HR 135, BP 90/50, RR 32 and labored, SpO2 85% on 6L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the left and hyperresonance to percussion. There is also tracheal deviation to the right. His chest tube is in place, but there is no fluctuation in the water seal chamber. A: Possible tension pneumothorax. He appears to be decompensating rapidly. R: I recommend immediate intervention for a suspected tension pneumothorax, including notifying the provider and preparing for needle thoracostomy or chest tube re-insertion. STAT portable chest x-ray has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Be prepared to administer oxygen via non-rebreather mask.",
