The patient's SpO2 of 85% on 6L nasal cannula indicates severe hypoxemia.

The second intercostal space, midclavicular line, is the recommended site for this procedure. By inserting a large-bore needle into the pleural space, trapped air can escape, converting the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax and improving venous return and cardiac output. This buys time until a chest tube can be placed or the existing one is addressed."

            "rationale": "While hypotension is present (BP 90/50 mmHg), the primary issue is impaired ventilation due to the pneumothorax. The hypotension is likely secondary to decreased venous return caused by the increased intrathoracic pressure compressing the great vessels. Addressing the pneumothorax will improve oxygenation and ventilation, indirectly improving perfusion. Fluid boluses are not the immediate priority and could worsen respiratory distress by increasing pulmonary edema if the underlying issue is not resolved."

A blocked chest tube can prevent air from escaping the pleural space, leading to a tension pneumothorax. Start by checking the tubing from the insertion site to the drainage system, ensuring there are no bends, clamps, or clots. This action could quickly resolve the issue if a simple obstruction is identified, restoring proper drainage and relieving the tension."

Given the patient's labored breathing, desaturation, and elevated PaCO2 (60 mmHg), respiratory therapy's expertise is valuable. They can assist with bag-valve-mask ventilation if necessary, or prepare for intubation if the patient's condition continues to deteriorate. Their involvement ensures optimal respiratory support and monitoring."

Administering morphine could further depress the respiratory drive and worsen the patient's hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Pain management should be addressed after the pneumothorax is stabilized and the patient's respiratory status has improved. The risk of respiratory depression outweighs the benefit of pain relief in this acute situation."
