            "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: Maria Rodriguez, a 68-year-old female, was admitted three days ago with a new diagnosis of heart failure exacerbation. She presented with shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue.\nBackground: Mrs. Rodriguez has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with oral medications. She lives alone in a subsidized housing apartment. Her daughter lives 3 hours away and can visit occasionally. She states she often has difficulty affording her medications and groceries.\nAssessment: Currently, Mrs. Rodriguez’s vital signs are stable, and her edema has significantly decreased with diuretic therapy. She understands the importance of a low-sodium diet and medication adherence but expresses concern about affording healthy food and managing her medications at home. She also states she has difficulty walking long distances.\nRecommendation: I recommend we connect Mrs. Rodriguez with social work to address her financial concerns, provide education on community resources for food assistance, and arrange for home health services to monitor her medication adherence and overall well-being. We should also explore transportation options to her follow-up appointments.",

            "correct": "Referring the client to a social worker (Option C) is essential because it directly addresses the social determinants of health (SDOH) affecting the client's ability to manage her condition at home, such as financial constraints and access to resources. Social workers can connect patients with resources like food banks, prescription assistance programs, and transportation services, which are crucial for adherence to treatment plans. Arranging for home health services (Option D) is also essential as it ensures medication adherence, ongoing assessment, and support in the home environment, which is crucial for preventing readmission. Home health nurses can monitor vital signs, assess for signs of worsening heart failure, and provide education and support to the patient and their family. While providing education (Option B), assessing medication side effects (Option F), and scheduling follow-up (Option A) are important, they do not directly tackle the SDOH barriers. Discharging the client without addressing these needs (Option E) is inappropriate and could lead to poor outcomes.",
