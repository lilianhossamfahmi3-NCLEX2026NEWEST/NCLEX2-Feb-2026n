He has a history of hypertension and COPD.\n\nBackground: He was stable until approximately 06:00 when he became acutely agitated and diaphoretic.\n\nAssessment: Current vital signs: BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 220 bpm, RR 32, SpO2 88% on 2L nasal cannula. The monitor shows a wide-complex tachycardia. The patient is barely responsive and complaining of chest pain. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse wheezing. Capillary refill is prolonged at 4 seconds. He appears pale and clammy. He is alert only to painful stimuli. Labs from yesterday showed normal electrolytes. He is currently on continuous telemetry. Oxygen was increased to 6L via facemask with minimal improvement in SpO2.\n\nRecommendation: The patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating. I suspect unstable ventricular tachycardia. I recommend immediate intervention, including possible cardioversion. Request STAT cardiology consult and anticipate the need for advanced airway management. Time: 06:15"

Unstable V-tach/SVT requires immediate intervention to prevent further hemodynamic compromise and potential cardiac arrest. Synchronized cardioversion is the recommended first-line treatment for unstable V-tach/SVT to restore a stable heart rhythm and improve perfusion. This is because the patient is symptomatic and intervention is needed urgently.",

Obtaining a 12-lead ECG (c) is important for confirming the dysrhythmia, but it is not the priority action in an unstable patient. The priority is to stabilize the patient. Closely monitoring the patient (d) without intervention is inappropriate given the patient's unstable condition. This would delay necessary treatment and could lead to further deterioration.",
