She started the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) about 30 minutes ago. \n\nHer BP has dropped from 130/80 to 90/50, HR increased from 80 to 120, and she reports chills and lower back pain. She appears anxious and diaphoretic. Her temperature is now 38.9°C (102°F), up from 37°C (98.6°F) prior to the transfusion. \n\nI am concerned she is having an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. I have stopped the transfusion, but I need further orders. She has a history of osteoarthritis and no known allergies. \n\nI recommend we draw blood for a transfusion reaction workup, administer IV fluids, and monitor her urine output. Would you like any additional information or have any further orders at this time?"

    "correct": "Stopping the transfusion is the priority action when a hemolytic transfusion reaction is suspected. This prevents further exposure to the incompatible blood, which can lead to severe complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute kidney injury. Disconnecting the IV tubing prevents any residual blood from entering the patient's circulation. Immediate intervention is crucial to minimize the severity of the reaction and potentially life-threatening consequences.",
    "incorrect": "Administering diphenhydramine is a secondary intervention to address allergic symptoms, but it does not halt the underlying hemolytic process. Collecting a urine specimen is important for diagnostic purposes, but delaying cessation of the transfusion will exacerbate the reaction. Slowing the transfusion rate is contraindicated as it continues to expose the patient to the incompatible blood and will worsen the reaction.",
