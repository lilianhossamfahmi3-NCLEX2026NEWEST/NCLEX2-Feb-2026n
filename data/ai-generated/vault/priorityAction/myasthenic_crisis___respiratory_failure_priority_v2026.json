She was admitted 3 days ago for exacerbation of her MG.\nB: She has been receiving pyridostigmine and corticosteroids. Her respiratory status has been stable until approximately 30 minutes ago.\nA: At 07:00, the patient reported increasing difficulty breathing and generalized weakness. Her current vital signs are: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR 8 (shallow), SpO2 85% on room air. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally. She is increasingly anxious and appears fatigued. She is able to speak only in short phrases. ABG results from 07:15: pH 7.20, PaCO2 65, PaO2 55, HCO3 24. Neuromuscular assessment shows severe generalized weakness including facial and oropharyngeal muscles. She has a weak cough reflex.\nR: I am concerned about impending respiratory failure secondary to myasthenic crisis. I recommend immediate respiratory support and potential intubation. I have already gathered intubation supplies and alerted the respiratory therapist. We should also prepare for possible administration of IVIG or plasmapheresis based on the provider's orders."

    "correct": "The patient's rapidly deteriorating respiratory status (SpO2 85%, RR 8, PaCO2 65, diminished breath sounds) indicates impending respiratory failure. The FIRST and MOST critical action is to provide immediate respiratory support with BVM ventilation and 100% oxygen to improve oxygenation and ventilation. This intervention buys time while further interventions are implemented.",
    "incorrect": "Administering edrophonium (Tensilon) is used to differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crisis; however, it is not the priority action when the patient is in acute respiratory distress. The priority is to support ventilation and oxygenation. Notifying the healthcare provider is important, but it should occur concurrently with, or immediately after, initiating respiratory support. Elevating the head of the bed can assist with breathing, but it will not address the underlying problem of respiratory muscle weakness and is insufficient to prevent further respiratory decline. BVM ventilation is the priority.",
