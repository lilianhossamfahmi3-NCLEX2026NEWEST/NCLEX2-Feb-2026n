            "content": "This is the immediate priority action. The client's pleural space is maintained at a negative pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, which is essential for lung expansion. A disconnected chest tube creates a direct, open pathway from the atmosphere into the pleural space. During inhalation, the negative intrapleural pressure will draw atmospheric air into the chest, causing the lung to collapse (pneumothorax). Submerging the distal end of the tube in sterile water immediately re-establishes a water seal. This acts as a one-way valve: air can bubble out of the chest during exhalation (when intrapleural pressure is higher), but air is prevented from being drawn back in during inhalation. This intervention is a critical temporizing measure to prevent the progression to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax while a new drainage system is prepared."

            "content": "The Valsalva maneuver, which involves forced expiration against a closed glottis, is used specifically during the planned removal of a chest tube. The maneuver intentionally increases intrathoracic pressure to prevent ambient air from entering the pleural space through the chest wall tract as the tube is being withdrawn. In this situation of a disconnected tube, this maneuver does not solve the problem of air entering through the open tube lumen during subsequent inspirations and may cause unnecessary strain and anxiety for a client who is already at risk for respiratory distress."

            "content": "This action is incorrect for a disconnected tube and is indicated only when the chest tube is completely dislodged from the client's chest wall. In this scenario, the tube remains inserted in the client. Applying a dressing to the insertion site does not address the primary problem: the open lumen of the chest tube, which is allowing communication between the pleural space and the atmosphere. This action fails to prevent air from entering the pleural space during inspiration and would not resolve the immediate risk of lung collapse."

            "content": "Contacting the healthcare provider is a necessary step, but it is not the first action. The immediate threat to the client is the entry of air into the pleural space with each breath, leading to a rapidly progressing pneumothorax. This is a physiological emergency that requires an immediate nursing intervention to stabilize the client. Delaying the creation of a temporary water seal to make a phone call allows more air to enter the pleural space, increasing the risk of respiratory compromise and a potential tension pneumothorax. The nurse must first intervene to re-establish the closed system before notifying the provider."

        "content": "The most common error is confusing the intervention for a *disconnected* chest tube (still in the patient, but detached from the drainage unit) with a *dislodged* chest tube (completely pulled out of the patient's chest). A disconnected tube creates an open conduit to the pleural space *through the tube itself*—the immediate fix is to create a new water seal by placing the tube's end in sterile water. A dislodged tube creates an open wound in the chest wall—the immediate fix is to cover the site with a sterile occlusive dressing, typically taped on three sides, to prevent air from entering while allowing trapped air to escape."
