Background: J.B. has a history of hypertension and COPD. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and oxygen therapy upon admission. Assessment: At 07:00, the nurse finds J.B. restless and diaphoretic. The arterial line dressing is soaked with blood, and there is pulsatile bleeding from the insertion site. Vital signs are: HR 120 bpm, BP 80/50 mmHg, RR 28, SpO2 88% on 4L nasal cannula. The monitor shows a rapidly dropping blood pressure. He is pale and confused. Current ABG results (from arterial line) are pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 60, HCO3 24. The IV antibiotics were scheduled for administration at 08:00. Recommendation: Immediate intervention is required to control the bleeding and stabilize J.B.'s hemodynamic status. Consider increasing oxygen delivery and notifying the provider."

    "correct": "The priority action is to apply direct pressure to the arterial line insertion site to control the bleeding. Arterial bleeding can lead to rapid blood loss and hemodynamic instability. Direct pressure is the most immediate and effective way to stop the hemorrhage and prevent further complications such as hypovolemic shock. This action addresses the immediate threat to the patient's life by controlling the source of bleeding.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the next scheduled dose of intravenous antibiotics is important for treating the pneumonia, but it is not the priority when the patient is actively bleeding and hemodynamically unstable. Increasing the rate of intravenous fluids may be necessary to address hypotension, but controlling the bleeding is the more immediate priority. Fluids alone will not stop the blood loss. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential, but it should occur after initial interventions, such as applying direct pressure, have been initiated. Delaying direct pressure to notify the provider first could lead to significant blood loss and further deterioration.",
