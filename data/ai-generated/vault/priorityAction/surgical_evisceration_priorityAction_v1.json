            "content": "Incorrect. Attempting to manually reduce the eviscerated bowel is contraindicated. The exposed bowel is likely edematous and has been contaminated by the external environment. Pushing it back into the sterile peritoneal cavity can introduce microorganisms, leading to fulminant peritonitis. Furthermore, this action can cause direct trauma to the friable serosal surface or create a kink in the bowel, leading to mechanical obstruction and compromised blood flow."

        {
            "optionId": "b",
            "content": "Correct. This is the immediate priority action. The serosal surface of the bowel is not designed for exposure to air, which causes rapid fluid evaporation and tissue desiccation, leading to necrosis. Covering the bowel with sterile gauze soaked in isotonic (0.9%) normal saline prevents drying and heat loss. The isotonic nature of the saline prevents osmotic fluid shifts that would occur with hypotonic or hypertonic solutions, thus preserving cellular integrity and tissue viability until emergency surgical repair can be performed."

        {
            "optionId": "c",
            "content": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a high-Fowler position increases gravitational and mechanical pressure on the abdominal contents, which in turn increases tension on the dehisced incision. This elevated intra-abdominal pressure can force more bowel to protrude from the opening, worsening the evisceration and potentially strangulating the blood supply to the exposed tissue. The recommended position is low-Fowler's with knees slightly flexed to relax the abdominal musculature and reduce tension on the suture line."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "d",
            "content": "Incorrect. Applying an abdominal binder over exposed bowel is extremely dangerous. The direct pressure from the binder would compress the mesenteric arteries and veins that supply the bowel loops. This compression can rapidly lead to vascular occlusion, causing profound tissue ischemia and subsequent infarction (necrosis) of the affected intestinal segment. Binders are used prophylactically to support an intact incision, not as a treatment for evisceration."

    ],
    "questionTrap": {
        "trap": "The primary trap is confusing the management of wound dehiscence (separation of wound edges) with evisceration (protrusion of internal organs). While a binder might be considered for dehiscence without organ protrusion, it is absolutely contraindicated for evisceration due to the risk of bowel ischemia. A second trap is the instinct to 'fix' the problem by pushing the organs back in, which seems logical but introduces a high risk of peritonitis and tissue damage."
