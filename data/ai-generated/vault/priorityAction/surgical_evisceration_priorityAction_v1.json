    {
      "optionId": "a",
      "content": "Incorrect. Attempting to manually reduce the eviscerated bowel is contraindicated due to the high risk of introducing infection and causing further trauma. The exposed bowel is vulnerable to contamination and edema. Pushing it back into the peritoneal cavity can introduce microorganisms, leading to peritonitis. Furthermore, this action can cause direct trauma to the bowel's serosal surface or create a kink, leading to mechanical obstruction and compromised blood flow. This could result in bowel ischemia and necrosis. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Evisceration compromises the sterile peritoneal cavity. Introducing bacteria leads to a cascade of inflammatory responses, potentially resulting in sepsis and multi-organ failure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Never attempt to manually reduce eviscerated organs. Focus on protecting the exposed tissue and preventing further contamination."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "content": "Correct. This is the immediate priority action. The serosal surface of the bowel is not designed for air exposure, which causes rapid fluid evaporation and tissue desiccation, leading to necrosis. Covering the bowel with sterile gauze soaked in isotonic (0.9%) normal saline prevents drying and heat loss. The isotonic nature of the saline prevents osmotic fluid shifts that would occur with hypotonic or hypertonic solutions, thus preserving cellular integrity and tissue viability until emergency surgical repair can be performed. The nurse should also notify the surgeon immediately and prepare the patient for surgery.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Normal saline maintains the osmotic balance of the bowel tissue, preventing cellular damage from fluid shifts. This buys time and preserves tissue viability until surgical intervention.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use only sterile normal saline. Avoid using tap water or other solutions, as they can damage the exposed bowel tissue."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "content": "Incorrect. Placing the client in a high-Fowler position increases gravitational and mechanical pressure on the abdominal contents, which in turn increases tension on the dehisced incision. This elevated intra-abdominal pressure can force more bowel to protrude from the opening, worsening the evisceration and potentially strangulating the blood supply to the exposed tissue. The recommended position is low-Fowler's with knees slightly flexed to relax the abdominal musculature and reduce tension on the suture line.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Increased intra-abdominal pressure exacerbates the evisceration by forcing more bowel through the weakened incision site. This can compromise blood flow to the exposed tissue.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Position the patient to minimize intra-abdominal pressure. Low-Fowler's with knee flexion is the preferred position."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "content": "Incorrect. Applying an abdominal binder over exposed bowel is extremely dangerous. The direct pressure from the binder would compress the mesenteric arteries and veins that supply the bowel loops. This compression can rapidly lead to vascular occlusion, causing profound tissue ischemia and subsequent infarction (necrosis) of the affected intestinal segment. Binders are used prophylactically to support an intact incision, not as a treatment for evisceration.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Compression of mesenteric vessels leads to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel. This can result in sepsis and potentially death.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Never apply direct pressure to eviscerated organs. This can compromise blood flow and cause irreversible damage."

  "questionTrap": {
    "trap": "The primary trap is confusing the management of wound dehiscence (separation of wound edges) with evisceration (protrusion of internal organs). While a binder might be considered for dehiscence without organ protrusion, it is absolutely contraindicated for evisceration due to the risk of bowel ischemia. A second trap is the instinct to 'fix' the problem by pushing the organs back in, which seems logical but introduces a high risk of peritonitis and tissue damage."

    "mnemonic": "For Evisceration, remember the 4 S's: **S**aline-soaked sterile dressing, **S**tay with the client (reassure), **S**upine with knees bent (low-Fowler's), **S**tat call to the surgeon. Never 'stuff' or 'strap'."

    "background": "The client underwent abdominal surgery 3 days ago. The client reports coughing prior to the event. Surgical evisceration is a serious postoperative complication.",
    "assessment": "Assessment reveals bowel loops protruding through the surgical incision. The client is likely experiencing pain and anxiety. Vital signs should be monitored closely for signs of shock or infection.",
    "recommendation": "1. Immediately cover the area with sterile gauze soaked in normal saline. 2. Place the client in a low-Fowler's position with knees slightly flexed. 3. Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes. 4. Establish IV access if not already present. 5. Administer pain medication as prescribed. 6. Keep the client NPO. 7. Prepare the client for emergency surgery. 8. Notify the surgeon immediately at (XXX) XXX-XXXX at 1400. 9. Document all findings and interventions."
