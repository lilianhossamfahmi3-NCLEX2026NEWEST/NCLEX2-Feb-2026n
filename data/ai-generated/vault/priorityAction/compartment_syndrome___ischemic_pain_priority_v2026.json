He had a tibial fracture repair this morning.\nB: Mr. Davies is a 45-year-old male who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a tibial fracture at 08:00 today. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Pre-op assessment was unremarkable.\nA: The patient is reporting severe pain in his lower leg that is unrelieved by opioid medication. Pain is 10/10. His foot is pale, and he reports numbness and tingling. Pedal pulse is difficult to palpate. Dressing is intact, but the leg appears swollen and tense. Capillary refill is >3 seconds. Neurovascular checks were stable immediately post-op. Pain medication given at 13:00. \nR: I suspect compartment syndrome. I need an immediate evaluation to assess for possible fasciotomy. Please provide orders for pain management and preparation for possible surgical intervention. Continuous neurovascular checks are ongoing. The patient is very anxious and distressed."
