        "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, including agitation, confusion, muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and hyperactive bowel sounds. These symptoms have developed shortly after the initiation of buspirone in a patient already taking sertraline, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome. The priority action is to immediately discontinue the offending medication (buspirone) to prevent further serotonin accumulation. Contacting the healthcare provider is crucial to report the patient's condition and obtain further orders for specific interventions, such as cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, and supportive care.",
        "incorrect": "Administering an antipyretic (b) is a lower priority. While the patient has a fever, the underlying cause is likely related to excessive serotonergic activity, and antipyretics will not address the root cause. Aggressively managing hyperthermia with cooling blankets and ice packs (c) is important, but only after discontinuing the medication. Addressing the cause is the priority. Dantrolene (d) is used in the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), not serotonin syndrome. While there may be some overlapping symptoms, the treatment is different.",

Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur with serotonergic medications, while NMS is associated with antipsychotic medications. Also, clonus is more specific to serotonin syndrome, while lead-pipe rigidity is more common in NMS. The rapid onset after starting a new serotonergic medication is a key clue here. Review the MAR and SBAR tabs."
