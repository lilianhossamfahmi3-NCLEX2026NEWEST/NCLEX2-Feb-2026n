His last bowel movement was three days ago. B: He has a history of autonomic dysreflexia. He has a chronic indwelling urinary catheter due to neurogenic bladder. He usually manages his bowel program every other day with digital stimulation. A: His blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg, heart rate is 52 bpm. He is restless and anxious, rating his headache as 8/10. I auscultated clear lung sounds bilaterally. His skin is pale and cool below the level of injury. 14:15: Notified Dr. Smith with the above information. R: I recommend immediately addressing the potential autonomic dysreflexia by elevating his head, checking his catheter for patency, and assessing for any other potential triggers. I will continue to monitor his vital signs every 5 minutes. Will need orders for BP management and bowel management."

        "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency characterized by an abrupt onset of excessively high blood pressure, bradycardia, and other autonomic symptoms. The FIRST action is to elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to promote orthostatic hypotension and reduce blood pressure. Loosening tight clothing can also help reduce external stimuli that may be exacerbating the condition. This immediate intervention aims to decrease the patient's blood pressure rapidly and prevent complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen addresses the symptom of headache but does not treat the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia and is a lower priority. Checking the catheter patency is an important step in identifying and addressing a potential cause of autonomic dysreflexia but is secondary to immediately reducing the blood pressure. Notifying the healthcare provider is essential, but it should occur concurrently with or immediately after implementing initial interventions to lower blood pressure. Waiting for an order before taking any action delays critical treatment.",
