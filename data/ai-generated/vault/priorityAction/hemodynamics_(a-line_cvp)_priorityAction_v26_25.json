    "correct": "Assessing the arterial line insertion site and patency is the priority. A dampened arterial waveform suggests a clot, kink, or air bubble in the system, which can lead to inaccurate blood pressure readings and compromise tissue perfusion. The rising CVP indicates possible fluid overload or right ventricular dysfunction, but ensuring accurate arterial pressure monitoring is the immediate priority to guide interventions. Accurate blood pressure monitoring is crucial for appropriate interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a diuretic without assessing the arterial line could be harmful if the dampened waveform is causing a falsely low blood pressure reading. Calling the provider is important, but assessment precedes notification. Increasing the IV fluid rate would exacerbate the potential fluid overload indicated by the rising CVP. Each of these options may be appropriate at some point, but initial assessment is the priority.",
