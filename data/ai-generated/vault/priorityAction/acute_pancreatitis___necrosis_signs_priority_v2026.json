He reports a pain level of 8/10 despite morphine administration. 06:05 - B: History of chronic alcohol abuse; diagnosed with acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. Initial amylase and lipase were elevated. Currently on IV fluids, pain medication, and NPO. 06:10 - A: Patient is increasingly restless and anxious. Respiratory rate is 34 and labored, with coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 88% on 6L via nasal cannula. BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm. New onset confusion noted. Cullen's and Grey Turner's signs are present. 06:15 - R: I am concerned about impending respiratory failure secondary to possible ARDS or pancreatic necrosis complications. I recommend immediate evaluation by the intensivist, preparation for intubation and mechanical ventilation, and consideration for transfer to ICU. We need to closely monitor his respiratory status and be prepared to manage potential complications."

    "correct": "The patient's respiratory status (RR 34, SpO2 88% on 6L NC, PaO2 60 mmHg, PaCO2 50 mmHg) indicates acute respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS or complications from pancreatic necrosis. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary to support oxygenation and ventilation. The presence of Cullen's and Grey Turner's signs suggests pancreatic necrosis with retroperitoneal hemorrhage, further exacerbating the patient's critical condition. Delaying intubation could lead to respiratory arrest and death. This is the FIRST priority.",
    "incorrect": "Administering morphine is inappropriate at this time because the patient is already showing signs of respiratory depression, and opioids can worsen this condition. IV fluids are important for hemodynamic support, but addressing the respiratory failure takes priority. While nutritional support is important, it is not the immediate priority in the face of acute respiratory distress.",
