    "correct": "Placental abruption is a life-threatening emergency for both the mother and the fetus. The primary concern is to expedite delivery, typically via cesarean section, to minimize maternal blood loss and fetal hypoxia. The signs of fetal distress (late decelerations, decreased variability) coupled with maternal hypovolemia indicate the need for immediate surgical intervention. Delaying delivery to perform other interventions increases the risk of adverse outcomes.",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are important, they are secondary to preparing for immediate delivery.\n- Administering IV fluids is important for hypovolemia, but it should not delay preparation for surgery.\n- Fetal monitoring is already in place and showing distress. Further monitoring will not change the need for immediate delivery.\n- Contacting the obstetrician is important, but the obstetrician is likely already aware given the severity of the situation. The priority is to prepare for the cesarean section.",
