    "correct": "The priority in DKA management is to address the life-threatening issues first. Initial actions should focus on fluid resuscitation to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, followed by insulin administration to address hyperglycemia and ketogenesis. Potassium replacement is crucial to prevent hypokalemia as insulin drives potassium into cells. Finally, identifying and treating the underlying cause (e.g., infection) addresses the trigger for DKA. Delaying any of these steps can lead to worsening acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially fatal outcomes.",
    "incorrect": "Administering potassium before initiating fluid resuscitation can be harmful if the patient is already hyperkalemic due to dehydration and acidosis. Addressing the underlying cause should follow initial stabilization. Administering insulin before addressing fluid deficit can worsen hypokalemia and shock. Providing 0.45% normal saline is a maintenance fluid, not a resuscitation fluid for severe dehydration. Waiting to correct electrolytes until after insulin is administered can lead to dangerous hypokalemia.",
