        "content": "S: The patient is a 32-year-old male, John Doe, who was brought to the emergency department by ambulance at 14:30 after a reported suicide attempt. He was found by his roommate, having ingested a handful of acetaminophen pills and several unidentified pills.\n\nB: Mr. Doe has a history of major depressive disorder diagnosed 5 years ago and has been prescribed sertraline 100mg daily. According to his roommate, he has been increasingly withdrawn over the past few weeks due to a recent job loss and relationship breakup. He expressed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness earlier today.\n\nA: On arrival, the patient was initially alert and oriented, but increasingly agitated. Vital signs are: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. The patient reports severe abdominal pain and expresses ongoing suicidal ideation, stating, 'I want to die.' He admits to taking the pills approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. Pupils are dilated. He is pacing and appears anxious. Mental status exam reveals pressured speech and poor eye contact.\n\nR: I recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation and medical management of potential overdose. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and mental status is crucial. Implement suicide precautions, including removing any potentially harmful objects from his environment. Consider toxicology screening and initiation of GI decontamination protocols based on ingested substance identification and time of ingestion. The patient requires a safe and secure environment."
