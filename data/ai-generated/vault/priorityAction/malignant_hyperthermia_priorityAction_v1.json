      "content": "Administering IV dantrolene sodium is the *immediate* priority. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis triggered by certain anesthetic agents (e.g., sevoflurane, succinylcholine) in susceptible individuals. The pathophysiology involves an uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. This leads to sustained muscle contraction, rigidity, rapid metabolism, heat production, and ultimately, organ damage. Dantrolene is a direct-acting muscle relaxant that binds to the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inhibiting calcium release. By reducing intracellular calcium, dantrolene reverses the hypermetabolic state, preventing further muscle damage, hyperthermia, and acidosis. Clinical Pearl: Early recognition and prompt dantrolene administration are crucial for survival. The dose is 2.5 mg/kg IV, repeated as needed, up to a maximum cumulative dose. SBAR: Situation: Client experiencing signs of MH (muscle rigidity, tachycardia, elevated ETCO2, hyperthermia). Background: Undergoing general anesthesia with sevoflurane. Assessment: Suspect MH. Recommendation: Prepare for immediate dantrolene administration. Time: 1400"

        "content": "Applying ice packs is a supportive measure to reduce hyperthermia, but it does not address the underlying cause of MH. The uncontrolled calcium release and hypermetabolism will continue to generate heat, overwhelming the cooling efforts. While cooling is important, it is secondary to dantrolene administration. Clinical Pearl: Active cooling measures include ice packs, cooling blankets, and iced saline infusions. Time: 1401"

        "content": "Obtaining an ABG is important for assessing the severity of metabolic acidosis and guiding treatment, but it delays the administration of life-saving dantrolene. The ABG will likely show a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production and lactic acid accumulation. However, the priority is to stop the hypermetabolic process with dantrolene. Clinical Pearl: Monitor ABGs closely to guide bicarbonate administration for severe acidosis. Time: 1402"

      {
        "optionId": "d",
        "content": "Increasing the flow rate of the anesthetic gas (sevoflurane) is contraindicated and would worsen the MH crisis. Sevoflurane is a triggering agent that initiates the uncontrolled calcium release. Increasing its concentration would exacerbate the hypermetabolic state, leading to further muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and cardiovascular collapse. The first step in managing MH is to immediately discontinue all triggering agents. Clinical Pearl: Always have non-triggering anesthetic agents available for MH-susceptible patients. Time: 1403"
