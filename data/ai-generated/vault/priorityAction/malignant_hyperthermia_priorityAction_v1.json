                "content": "Administering IV dantrolene sodium is the *immediate* priority. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis triggered by certain anesthetic agents (e.g., sevoflurane, succinylcholine) in susceptible individuals. The pathophysiology involves an uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. This leads to sustained muscle contraction, rigidity, rapid metabolism, heat production, and ultimately, organ damage. Dantrolene is a direct-acting muscle relaxant that binds to the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inhibiting calcium release. By reducing intracellular calcium, dantrolene reverses the hypermetabolic state, preventing further muscle damage, hyperthermia, and acidosis. Early recognition and prompt dantrolene administration are crucial for survival. The dose is 2.5 mg/kg IV, repeated as needed, up to a maximum cumulative dose."
