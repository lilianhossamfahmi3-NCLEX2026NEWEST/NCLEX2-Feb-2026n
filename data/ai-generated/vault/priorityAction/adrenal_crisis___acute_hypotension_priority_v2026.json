She has a history of long-term oral corticosteroid use for rheumatoid arthritis, which was recently discontinued.\nBackground: R.S. was stable until approximately 06:30, when she began complaining of weakness and dizziness. Her initial vital signs upon admission were within normal limits. She has been afebrile since admission until now. \nAssessment: The patient is currently hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 120 bpm. She is diaphoretic and appears confused. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally. Blood glucose is 68 mg/dL. The patient is oriented to person only. She reports severe abdominal pain. \nRecommendation: I suspect adrenal crisis due to her history of steroid use and the sudden onset of hypotension and altered mental status. I recommend immediate administration of IV hydrocortisone, fluid bolus, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Consider repeating labs, including cortisol levels."

    "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of adrenal crisis, including hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and confusion, likely precipitated by the abrupt cessation of long-term corticosteroid use. Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate glucocorticoid replacement. Administering IV hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef) as per the standing order is the priority action to stabilize the patient's condition by rapidly addressing the cortisol deficiency and preventing further hemodynamic collapse. This intervention directly counteracts the underlying pathophysiology of the crisis.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing the IV fluid rate is important for addressing hypotension, but it is secondary to addressing the underlying hormonal deficiency. While notifying the provider is essential, it should not delay the immediate administration of life-saving medication that is already prescribed. Obtaining an ECG is a relevant assessment, given the patient's symptoms and electrolyte imbalances; however, it is not the immediate priority in stabilizing the acute adrenal crisis.",
