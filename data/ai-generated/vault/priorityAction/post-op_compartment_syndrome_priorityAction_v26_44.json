    "correct": "Compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening and potentially life-threatening condition. The priority is to assess circulation, pulses, sensation, and movement in the affected limb to determine the extent of the compartment syndrome and risk to the patient. Elevating the extremity is contraindicated, as it can decrease arterial perfusion and worsen the condition. Early intervention is crucial to prevent permanent damage.",
    "incorrect": "Administering another dose of opioid analgesic may mask the symptoms of compartment syndrome and delay definitive treatment. Elevating the extremity is contraindicated in compartment syndrome, as it can further reduce arterial blood flow to the affected limb. Notifying the provider is essential, but assessing the client first provides the provider with vital information about the severity of the condition.",
