Situation: Patient is increasingly restless, anxious, and diaphoretic. Background: Admitted yesterday with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, currently prescribed metoprolol. Assessment: BP is 90/50 mmHg (baseline 160/90 mmHg), HR 120 bpm, RR 28, SpO2 92% on room air. Pain is 9/10 despite PRN morphine given 30 min ago. Auscultation reveals a new murmur. Peripheral pulses are weaker in the left arm than the right. Recommendation: I am concerned about possible aortic dissection given his symptoms and history. I recommend immediate evaluation by a physician, stat CT angiogram of the chest and abdomen, and preparation for potential surgical intervention. Please advise. The patient states, 'I feel like I am going to die!'"
