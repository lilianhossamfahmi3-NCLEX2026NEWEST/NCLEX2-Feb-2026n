He has a known allergy to bee stings.\n\nBackground: Mr. Lee was stung while gardening. He immediately developed hives, facial swelling, and difficulty breathing. He has a history of anaphylaxis and carries an epinephrine auto-injector, which he attempted to use but reports it may have misfired. His past medical history is unremarkable otherwise.\n\nAssessment: Mr. Lee is anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 30 and labored, SpO2 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals audible wheezing and stridor. There is visible angioedema of the lips and tongue. He is speaking in short sentences.\n\nRecommendation: I have already initiated oxygen. I recommend immediate administration of epinephrine, possible intubation, and transfer to critical care. I have started an IV and normal saline is infusing. Please advise on further management. I am concerned about impending airway closure."

    "correct": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it reverses the effects of histamine and other mediators released during an allergic reaction. It causes vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure; bronchodilation, which improves breathing; and reduces angioedema and urticaria. Given the patient's rapidly deteriorating condition with airway compromise (stridor, angioedema, SpO2 88%), administering epinephrine is the priority to prevent further deterioration and potential respiratory arrest. The IM route is preferred in this acute setting for rapid absorption.",
    "incorrect": "Applying oxygen is important, but it is not the priority over administering epinephrine in anaphylaxis. The patient's airway is compromised, and epinephrine is needed to reverse the underlying cause. Auscultating lung sounds can provide additional information, but it delays the administration of life-saving epinephrine. Elevating the head of the bed can help with breathing, but it is not the priority action in this situation. Epinephrine must be given immediately to address the vasodilation, bronchoconstriction and angioedema.",
