        "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. James, a 45-year-old male, arrived in the ED at 08:00 after a house fire. He has full-thickness burns covering 40% TBSA, primarily on his torso and legs. Background: Mr. James has a history of well-controlled hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He is alert and oriented. Assessment: At 08:00, vitals: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 26 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on room air. He reports severe pain (8/10) and is anxious. Burn areas are dry, leathery, and non-blanching. He received morphine 4mg IV at 07:45 en route. Urine output is minimal. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. At 08:15, labs show: Na 138 mEq/L, K 5.2 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, HCO3 22 mEq/L, BUN 25 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, Glucose 140 mg/dL, Lactate 2.8 mmol/L, Hgb 16 g/dL, Hct 48%. Chest X-ray at 08:30 shows clear lung fields. Recommendation: Initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula, monitor hourly urine output, manage pain, and monitor respiratory status. Consider intubation if respiratory distress increases or SpO2 drops below 90% despite oxygen. Obtain frequent ABGs.",

        "correct": "The priority in burn resuscitation is to restore intravascular volume and prevent hypovolemic shock, guided by the Parkland formula (4 mL/kg/%TBSA). Airway and breathing are always next, as inhalation injuries are common. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation, targeting 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr. Electrolyte imbalances are common in burn patients due to cell damage and fluid shifts, so monitoring is important. Pain management is essential for patient comfort but is lower priority than addressing immediate life-threatening issues like hypovolemic shock and respiratory compromise.",
