      "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. James, a 45-year-old male, presented to the ED at 08:00 after a house fire. He has full thickness burns covering 40% of his total body surface area (TBSA), primarily on his torso and legs. Background: Mr. James has a history of well-controlled hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Assessment: At 08:00, his vital signs are: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 26 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on room air. He is complaining of severe pain (8/10) and is anxious. Burn areas are dry, leathery, and non-blanching. He received morphine 4mg IV at 07:45 en route. Urine output is currently minimal. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Recommendation: I recommend initiating aggressive fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula, monitoring urine output hourly, and managing pain. Consider intubation if respiratory distress increases or if SpO2 drops below 90% despite oxygen administration. Frequent ABGs are needed.",

      "correct": "The priority in burn resuscitation is to restore intravascular volume and prevent hypovolemic shock, guided by the Parkland formula. Airway and breathing are always next. Monitoring urine output is crucial to assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation, targeting 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr. Electrolyte imbalances are common in burn patients due to cell damage and fluid shifts, so monitoring is important. Pain management is essential for patient comfort but is lower priority than addressing immediate life-threatening issues.",
