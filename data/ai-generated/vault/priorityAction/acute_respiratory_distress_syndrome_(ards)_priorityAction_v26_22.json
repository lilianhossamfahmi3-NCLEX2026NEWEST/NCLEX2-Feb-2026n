This optimizes oxygenation and protects the lungs from further injury by ensuring the patient's respiratory efforts are synchronized with the ventilator. This intervention is crucial when other measures fail to achieve adequate ventilation and oxygenation."

By placing the patient prone, previously compressed alveoli in the dorsal regions of the lungs are recruited, leading to more uniform inflation and improved gas exchange. This can significantly enhance oxygenation, especially in patients who are not responding to conventional ventilation strategies. The effect is often seen within hours of proning."

Current best practice involves lower tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg) to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Higher tidal volumes can cause barotrauma and worsen lung damage by overdistending already injured alveoli. This can lead to further inflammation and compromise respiratory function. The ARDSnet protocol emphasizes low tidal volume ventilation to minimize VILI."

In ARDS, the alveolar-capillary membrane is already compromised, and excess fluid can leak into the alveoli, further impairing gas exchange. Hemodynamic support should be guided by careful assessment of fluid status and cardiac function, often using parameters like central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) to avoid over-resuscitation."

High concentrations of oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species, causing damage to the alveolar epithelium and worsening lung injury. The goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation (SpO2 > 88-92%) with the lowest possible FiO2 to minimize the risk of oxygen toxicity. Therefore, other interventions should be prioritized first to improve oxygenation and reduce the FiO2 requirement."

In ARDS, many alveoli collapse due to inflammation and fluid accumulation. A PEEP of 10 cm H2O is a reasonable starting point to optimize alveolar recruitment, especially in ARDS, and can be titrated based on the patient's response and arterial blood gas results. PEEP increases functional residual capacity and enhances gas exchange by maintaining alveolar patency throughout the respiratory cycle."
