He has a right-sided chest tube connected to a closed drainage system.\n07:00 - B: Patient initially responded well to antibiotics and oxygen therapy. Chest tube was draining moderate serosanguinous fluid.\n07:05 - A: The chest tube became dislodged from the drainage system. There is bubbling at the insertion site, and the patient reports increasing shortness of breath and anxiety. Oxygen saturation has dropped from 94% to 88%. Respiratory rate is 28 and labored. Heart rate is 110. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side with noticeable air entry around the insertion site. Patient is diaphoretic. The dressing around the insertion site is no longer occlusive. The patient is restless and attempts to sit up. Pain level is reported as a 6 out of 10 at the insertion site.\n07:10 - R: I recommend immediate intervention to prevent further respiratory compromise. Consider assessing for a tension pneumothorax and preparing for potential reinsertion of the chest tube. Pain medication may be needed to manage discomfort."
