    "correct": "The patient's presentation strongly suggests a CSF leak secondary to a basilar skull fracture, evidenced by the clear nasal drainage, positive halo sign, headache, neck stiffness, and elevated temperature. CSF leaks increase the risk of ascending infection leading to meningitis, a life-threatening complication. Prompt notification of the neurosurgeon is crucial for immediate evaluation, potential surgical intervention to repair the fracture, and initiation of appropriate management strategies. Delaying notification could lead to rapid deterioration and increased morbidity/mortality. This aligns with the legal and ethical duty to advocate for patient safety and timely intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the antibiotic is a reasonable intervention, but it is secondary to confirming the CSF leak and getting definitive orders from the neurosurgeon. Prophylactic antibiotics are usually ordered, but the timing of that is less critical than the immediate consult.\n\nA lumbar puncture carries a risk of introducing infection in the presence of a CSF leak and is not the immediate priority. The risk of meningitis outweighs the diagnostic information gained at this point. Furthermore, lumbar puncture may not be safe if there is increased intracranial pressure.\n\nInserting a nasogastric tube is not indicated at this time. While aspiration risk is always a consideration, the immediate threat is the CSF leak and potential for meningitis. Focusing on the neurological compromise takes precedence.",
