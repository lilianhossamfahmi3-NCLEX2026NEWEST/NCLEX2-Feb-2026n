He has an external ventricular drain (EVD) in place.\n\n07:00 - Background: J.B. underwent aneurysm coiling yesterday. The EVD is draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appropriately, and he was neurologically stable overnight. His baseline GCS is 15.\n\n07:00 - Assessment: At 06:45, the patient reported a severe headache (8/10). Neurological assessment reveals a decreased level of alertness. His current GCS is 12 (Eyes 3, Verbal 4, Motor 5). Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but sluggish. Right-sided weakness is noted. EVD is draining minimal CSF, and the drainage bag is at the prescribed level. ICP reading via EVD is 22 mmHg.\n\n07:00 - Recommendation: I am concerned about a possible EVD malfunction or increased intracranial pressure. I request an urgent evaluation by the neurosurgeon. I will continue to monitor his neurological status and EVD output. I will obtain a STAT CT scan of the head as ordered."

    "correct": "The FIRST action should be to assess the EVD system for any mechanical issues such as kinks, air bubbles, or obstructions. These are common causes of EVD malfunction and can be quickly corrected by the nurse. Increased ICP and neurological deterioration can rapidly occur if CSF drainage is impeded. Addressing potential mechanical issues ensures the system functions correctly and may prevent further complications. Rapid intervention stabilizes the patient and provides time for further evaluation and intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Administering analgesics (b) is a reasonable intervention for headache, but it does not address the underlying cause of the increased ICP or potential EVD malfunction. Notifying the neurosurgeon (c) is important, but it should occur concurrently or after initial assessment of the EVD system. Repositioning the patient (d) may be helpful in some situations, but it is not the priority action when an EVD malfunction is suspected. Furthermore, placing the patient in a supine position may exacerbate the increased ICP. The priority is to ensure the EVD is functioning properly before implementing other interventions.",
