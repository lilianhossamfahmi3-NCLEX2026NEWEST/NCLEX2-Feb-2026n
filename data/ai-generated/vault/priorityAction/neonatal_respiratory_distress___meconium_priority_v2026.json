Infant is now 5 minutes old.\n\nBackground: Mother had no prenatal care. Apgar scores were 5 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes. Immediately post-delivery, the neonate was limp and cyanotic.\n\nAssessment: The neonate is now breathing spontaneously but with significant respiratory distress. Noted intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, and grunting. Heart rate is 150 bpm. Respiratory rate is 70 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. Temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F) axillary. Auscultation reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate initiation of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Consider intubation if respiratory distress persists despite PPV. The time is 08:05."

    "correct": "The neonate exhibits significant respiratory distress signs: cyanosis, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, and low oxygen saturation (85%). Coupled with meconium-stained amniotic fluid and low initial Apgar scores, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS) is highly probable. MAS causes airway obstruction, inflammation, and surfactant dysfunction, impairing gas exchange and causing hypoxemia. The FIRST and most critical action is initiating positive pressure ventilation (PPV) via bag-valve-mask for immediate ventilatory support and improved oxygenation. PPV opens alveoli, clears airways, and reduces breathing effort. Delaying PPV can lead to deterioration, hypoxia, and potential brain damage.",
    "incorrect": "Administering warmed, humidified oxygen via nasal cannula (Option B) is a lower priority because it won't adequately address the underlying ventilation problem. While oxygen supplementation is important, it's unlikely to be effective with significant airway obstruction and alveolar collapse. Obtaining a stat chest X-ray (Option C) is important for diagnosis but delays immediate intervention. Stabilizing the neonate's respiratory status is the priority before diagnostic tests. Preparing to administer surfactant (Option D) may be necessary later but isn't the FIRST action. Surfactant improves lung compliance and gas exchange but is ineffective without adequate ventilation. PPV should be initiated first, and the response assessed before considering surfactant administration.",
