Infant is now 5 minutes old.\n\nBackground: Mother had no prenatal care. Apgar scores were 5 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes. Immediately post-delivery, the neonate was limp and cyanotic.\n\nAssessment: The neonate is now breathing spontaneously but with significant respiratory distress. Noted intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, and grunting. Heart rate is 150 bpm. Respiratory rate is 70 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. Temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F) axillary. Auscultation reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate initiation of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Consider intubation if respiratory distress persists despite PPV. The time is 08:05."

    "correct": "The neonate is exhibiting signs of significant respiratory distress, including cyanosis, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, and a low oxygen saturation of 85%. These findings, coupled with the history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and low initial Apgar scores, indicate a high probability of Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS). MAS can cause airway obstruction, inflammation, and surfactant dysfunction, leading to impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia. The FIRST and most critical action is to initiate positive pressure ventilation (PPV) via bag-valve-mask to provide immediate ventilatory support and improve oxygenation. PPV helps to open the alveoli, clear the airways, and reduce the work of breathing. Delaying PPV in this situation can lead to further deterioration, hypoxia, and potential brain damage.",
    "incorrect": "Administering warmed, humidified oxygen via nasal cannula (Option B) is a lower priority because it will not adequately address the underlying ventilation problem. While oxygen supplementation is important, it is unlikely to be effective in the presence of significant airway obstruction and alveolar collapse. Obtaining a stat chest X-ray (Option C) is important for diagnosis, but it delays immediate intervention. The priority is to stabilize the neonate's respiratory status before pursuing diagnostic tests. Preparing to administer surfactant (Option D) may be necessary later, but it is not the FIRST action. Surfactant is used to improve lung compliance and gas exchange, but it will be ineffective if the neonate is not adequately ventilated first. PPV should be initiated first, and the response should be assessed before considering surfactant administration.",
