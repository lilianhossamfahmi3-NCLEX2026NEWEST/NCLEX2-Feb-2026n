    "correct": "Initiating oxygen therapy is the priority in septic shock to address tissue hypoxia and improve oxygen delivery to vital organs. Septic shock leads to vasodilation and decreased tissue perfusion, causing oxygen demand to exceed supply. Immediate oxygen support can mitigate the detrimental effects of hypoxia and support cellular function, improving patient outcomes in the critical initial phase of septic shock.",
    "incorrect": "Administering antibiotics, while crucial for treating the underlying infection, is not the immediate priority. Optimizing oxygenation takes precedence. Obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics is important, but delaying oxygen therapy for this can worsen hypoxia. Initiating vasopressors is essential for maintaining blood pressure in septic shock but follows initial oxygenation and fluid resuscitation.",
