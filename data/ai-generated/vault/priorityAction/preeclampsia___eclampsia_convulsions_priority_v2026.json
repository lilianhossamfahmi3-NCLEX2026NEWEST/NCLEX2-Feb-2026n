Magnesium sulfate infusion started at 2 g/hr.\nAssessment: At 14:15, client began exhibiting tonic-clonic movements. BP 180/120 mmHg during seizure. Fetal heart rate initially 140 bpm, now 100 bpm. Oxygen saturation dropping from 98% to 88%. Level of consciousness is currently unresponsive post seizure. Client is diaphoretic. Recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and decreased platelets.\nRecommendation: Immediate intervention to protect the client from injury and manage the seizure. Consider increasing magnesium sulfate bolus and preparing for potential delivery."

    "correct": "The priority during a seizure is to protect the client from injury. This includes padding side rails, removing any objects that could cause harm, and ensuring the client is in a safe environment. Maternal safety is paramount to fetal safety. This takes precedence over administering medication, assessing oxygen saturation, or documenting the seizure, although those actions are also important and should follow immediately after ensuring safety.",

Assessing oxygen saturation and applying oxygen is important, especially given the client's desaturation, but protecting the client from injury is the immediate priority. Documenting the seizure is important for medical records, but it is not the priority action during an active seizure.",
