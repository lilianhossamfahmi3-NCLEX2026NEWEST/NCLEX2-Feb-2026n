B: Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has been non-compliant with his medications for the past month. His wife reports he has been increasingly confused and lethargic over the past 24 hours. A: On admission at 08:00, the patient is somnolent but arousable to painful stimuli. Initial vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 32 and deep (Kussmaul respirations), SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 96.8°F (36°C). Glucose via glucometer reads 'HI'. A STAT venous blood gas (VBG) was sent. The provider was notified at 08:15 and initial orders received. R: The patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation to address severe dehydration and hyperosmolality. Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent neurological assessments are essential. Anticipate insulin administration once fluid resuscitation has begun and potassium levels are known. Further laboratory results are pending, including serum osmolality and electrolyte levels. Consider central line placement if peripheral access is difficult."

    "correct": "The patient presents with signs of severe dehydration (hypotension, tachycardia, poor skin turgor) and HHS (altered mental status, elevated serum sodium, hyperglycemia). The FIRST priority is to rapidly expand the intravascular volume with isotonic fluids to stabilize blood pressure and improve perfusion to vital organs. 0.9% normal saline is the appropriate initial fluid for resuscitation. A bolus of 500 mL/hr is necessary given the severity of the dehydration to restore vascular volume and prevent further hypoperfusion. Rapid fluid resuscitation will also help to dilute the elevated glucose levels and reduce the serum osmolality, which is a primary driver of the neurological symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "Administering insulin as an IV bolus (b) is incorrect as the priority is to correct the dehydration first. Insulin administration without adequate fluid resuscitation can lead to a rapid shift of potassium into the cells, potentially causing life-threatening hypokalemia. Checking blood glucose (c) is a routine monitoring task, but not the priority action in this acute situation. While frequent glucose monitoring is important, it doesn't address the immediate threat of hypovolemic shock. Obtaining an order for potassium replacement (d) is important, given the patient's potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L, but it is not the FIRST action. Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by insulin administration and fluid resuscitation, but these must be initiated first to stabilize the patient. Potassium should be replaced concurrently with fluid and insulin administration, but only after the initial fluid bolus is underway.",
