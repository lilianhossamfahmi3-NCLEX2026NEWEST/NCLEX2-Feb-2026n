She is now exhibiting signs of thyroid storm.\nBackground: Post-op day 1. Initial post-operative period was stable. Patient has been on maintenance dose of methimazole pre-operatively. No known allergies.\nAssessment: Patient is increasingly agitated and confused. Temperature is 105.8°F (41°C), heart rate is 180 bpm and irregular, blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Skin is flushed and diaphoretic. Patient reports severe headache and nausea.\nRecommendation: I am concerned about thyroid storm and hyperpyrexia. I recommend immediate intervention to reduce her temperature and stabilize her cardiovascular status. Consider transferring to ICU for closer monitoring and advanced interventions."

    "correct": "Aggressive cooling measures are the MOST immediate priority in hyperpyrexia (temperature >105.8°F/41°C) associated with thyroid storm. Hyperpyrexia can cause rapid cellular damage, neurological deficits, and death. While other interventions are important, lowering the temperature is paramount to prevent irreversible harm.",
    "incorrect": "Administering IV fluids is important for addressing dehydration, which can occur in thyroid storm due to increased metabolism and diaphoresis. However, it is secondary to addressing the hyperpyrexia.\n\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid medication that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. While PTU is a crucial component of treating thyroid storm, it takes time to have an effect. Therefore, it is not the FIRST action.\n\nBeta-blockers like propranolol are used to manage the cardiovascular symptoms of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia and hypertension. However, the immediate threat is the hyperpyrexia, which must be addressed first.",
