His diabetes has typically been well-controlled. He ate approximately 75% of his breakfast.\n07:10 - A: The patient is now exhibiting sudden onset confusion, diaphoresis, and tremors. His speech is slurred. Current vital signs: HR 98, BP 140/88, RR 22, SpO2 96% on 2L NC, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F). A STAT blood glucose was ordered and resulted as 48 mg/dL. The patient is able to swallow but is increasingly lethargic. Neuroglycopenic symptoms are rapidly progressing. \n07:15 - R: I recommend immediate intervention for hypoglycemia. Consider the need for further investigation into the cause of the sudden drop in blood glucose. I am concerned about rapid neurological decline."

The priority is to immediately increase the patient's blood glucose to prevent further neurological damage. IV D50 is the fastest way to raise blood glucose levels in a patient who is able to swallow but is rapidly deteriorating. Delaying treatment could lead to seizures, coma, or death. The other options are important but are secondary to addressing the immediate threat of neuroglycopenia.",

Notifying the healthcare provider is necessary, but it should not delay the immediate administration of glucose. Glucagon is an acceptable alternative if IV access is unavailable or if the patient is unable to swallow, but IV D50 is preferred in this scenario because the patient can still swallow and IV access is established.",
