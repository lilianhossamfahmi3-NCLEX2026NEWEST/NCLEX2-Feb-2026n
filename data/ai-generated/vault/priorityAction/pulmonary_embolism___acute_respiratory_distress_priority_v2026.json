He was admitted 3 days ago for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and started on heparin. He's now complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nBackground: His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has no known allergies. He was stable until approximately 30 minutes ago when he became acutely dyspneic.\n\nAssessment: His current vital signs are: HR 130 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 36 breaths/min and labored, SpO2 85% on 2L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side. He is anxious and diaphoretic. ABG results just received show pH 7.25, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. The patient is using accessory muscles to breathe.\n\nRecommendation: I am concerned about a possible pulmonary embolism. I request immediate evaluation by the rapid response team and orders for further management, including possible intubation and ventilation."

    "correct": "The patient's presentation (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, decreased breath sounds, and elevated D-dimer) strongly suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE) leading to acute respiratory failure. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis (pH 7.25, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg), signifying that the patient is unable to effectively ventilate and oxygenate. Given the severity of the respiratory distress and the patient's deteriorating condition, the FIRST and most critical action is to prepare for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to support oxygenation and ventilation. This will stabilize the patient and prevent further respiratory compromise, which could lead to cardiac arrest.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a fluid bolus might be considered for hypotension, but the priority is addressing the respiratory failure. While hypotension should be addressed, improving ventilation and oxygenation are paramount to stabilize the patient. Increasing the oxygen flow rate via nasal cannula is insufficient given the patient's severe hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. The SpO2 of 85% on 2L indicates that supplemental oxygen alone is not adequately improving oxygenation. The patient needs immediate ventilatory support. Chest physiotherapy may be helpful in the long term to mobilize secretions, but it is not the priority in this acute situation. The patient's immediate need is respiratory support and stabilization.",
