        "correct": "Assessing the arterial line insertion site for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation is the priority. An arterial line provides continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent blood sampling, but it also carries the risk of bleeding. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent complications such as hemorrhage or compartment syndrome. Ignoring this could lead to rapid deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "While monitoring CVP, adjusting ventilator settings, and administering medications are all important aspects of patient care in the ICU, they are not the immediate priority in this scenario. CVP monitoring is important for assessing fluid status, but it does not pose an immediate threat to the patient's safety like potential arterial line bleeding. Adjusting ventilator settings should be based on ABGs and respiratory assessment, but the immediate priority is to ensure patient safety related to the arterial line. Administering medications can wait until the arterial line site has been assessed.",
