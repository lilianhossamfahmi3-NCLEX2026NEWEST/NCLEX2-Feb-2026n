Unrestrained driver in a head-on collision, sustaining significant chest trauma. En route, O2 sat dropped to 85%.\n\nAssessment: Absent left-side breath sounds, tracheal deviation to the right, increasing dyspnea. O2 sat 88% on room air. HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 (labored). Anxious, diaphoretic. No air entry on the left upon auscultation. Asymmetrical chest wall movement. Possible fractured ribs upon palpation. Hemoglobin 10 g/dL, Hematocrit 30%.\n\nRecommendation: Suspect tension pneumothorax. Requires urgent decompression via needle thoracostomy. Prepare for chest tube insertion. Continuous vital sign monitoring essential. Stat chest x-ray order needed.",

        "correct": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition where air enters the pleural space but cannot escape, leading to increased pressure that compresses the lung and mediastinum. This results in decreased cardiac output and impaired ventilation. The priority intervention is immediate needle thoracostomy in the second intercostal space, midclavicular line, on the affected side to relieve the pressure. Oxygen administration alone is insufficient, and delaying treatment for diagnostic tests can be fatal. This intervention converts the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, allowing for improved ventilation and hemodynamic stability.",
