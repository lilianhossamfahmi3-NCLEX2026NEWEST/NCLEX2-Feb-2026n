He was the unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. Initial assessment revealed significant chest trauma.\n\nAssessment: The patient presents with absent breath sounds on the left side, tracheal deviation to the right, and increasing dyspnea. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Vital signs: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 and labored. He is anxious and diaphoretic. Auscultation reveals no air entry on the left. Chest wall movement is asymmetrical. Possible fractured ribs noted on palpation. Hemoglobin 10, Hematocrit 30.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention for a suspected tension pneumothorax. The patient requires urgent decompression. Prepare for chest tube insertion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential. Notify the physician immediately to order a chest x-ray.",

This results in decreased cardiac output and impaired ventilation. The priority intervention is immediate needle thoracostomy in the second intercostal space, midclavicular line, on the affected side to relieve the pressure. Oxygen administration alone is insufficient, and delaying treatment for diagnostic tests can be fatal.",
