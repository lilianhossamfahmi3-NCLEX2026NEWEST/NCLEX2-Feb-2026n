She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nB: The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics yesterday. She has been hypotensive despite initial fluid resuscitation. Her oxygen saturation is declining, and she is increasingly lethargic.\n\nA: 07:00: BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 32 and labored, SpO2 88% on 6L NC. Patient is confused and restless. Noted oozing from IV site and old venipuncture sites. New petechiae observed on chest and abdomen. Urine output decreased to 15 mL/hr. The patient is bleeding. \n\nR: I am concerned about possible DIC given her sepsis, hypotension, bleeding, and new petechiae. I recommend STAT labs including PT, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and platelet count. I also recommend immediate administration of platelets and cryoprecipitate based on lab results and continued assessment of bleeding. Consider transfer to ICU for closer monitoring and possible blood product transfusion. Please assess immediately. Notify provider."

    "correct": "The patient's lab values (prolonged PT/PTT, elevated D-dimer, decreased fibrinogen and platelets) combined with the oozing from sites and petechiae strongly suggest Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). DIC is a life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to widespread clotting and subsequent depletion of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding. The priority action is to administer platelets to address the thrombocytopenia and support clotting. This directly addresses the immediate threat of hemorrhage. The provider order is already in place to administer platelets.",
    "incorrect": "Applying direct pressure (B) is a reasonable action to control localized bleeding, but it doesn't address the underlying systemic issue of DIC. This is a secondary action.\nElevating the lower extremities (C) might be appropriate for hypovolemic shock related to blood loss, but it does not address the underlying clotting factor and platelet deficiencies in DIC. This is a lower priority.\nAdministering a bolus of normal saline (D) might be considered for hypotension, but in DIC, aggressive fluid resuscitation can exacerbate bleeding by diluting clotting factors further. Addressing the coagulopathy with platelet transfusion is the higher priority.",
