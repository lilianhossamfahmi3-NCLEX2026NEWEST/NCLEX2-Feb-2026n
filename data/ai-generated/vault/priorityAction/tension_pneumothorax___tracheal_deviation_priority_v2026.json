He has a history of COPD, managed with home oxygen at 2L per nasal cannula.\n\n<b>Assessment:</b> At 07:00, the patient reported sudden onset of sharp right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. Respiratory rate is 32 and labored, SpO2 is 85% on room air. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side. Trachea is deviated to the left. Heart rate is 120 bpm, and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. Patient is increasingly anxious and diaphoretic. The dressing site is clean, dry, and intact.\n\n<b>Recommendation:</b> I suspect a tension pneumothorax secondary to the central line placement. I request immediate intervention, including preparation for needle thoracostomy and rapid response team evaluation. I am administering oxygen via nasal cannula. I need orders for a chest x-ray."

        "correct": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to relieve pressure in the pleural space. Needle thoracostomy is the immediate priority to decompress the affected side, converting the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, allowing for improved ventilation and perfusion. Delaying this intervention can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death. The classic signs of tracheal deviation (away from the affected side), acute respiratory distress, and diminished breath sounds on the affected side are indicative of this emergency. The nurse should prepare for needle thoracostomy, which may include gathering supplies and assisting the provider.",
        "incorrect": "Administering high-flow oxygen is important, but it will not resolve the underlying pressure causing the tension pneumothorax. While notifying the physician is necessary, it is not the immediate priority when the nurse recognizes a tension pneumothorax. The nurse must act within their scope of practice to initiate life-saving measures. Obtaining a chest X-ray is useful for confirming the diagnosis, but it delays immediate treatment and is not the priority action in this acute, life-threatening situation. The clinical presentation strongly suggests tension pneumothorax, making immediate decompression the priority.",
