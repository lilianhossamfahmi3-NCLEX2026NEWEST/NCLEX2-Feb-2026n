Vital signs: HR 120, RR 28 and shallow, BP 90/60, SpO2 88% on room air. Pupils are equal and reactive, but sluggish. Skin is flushed and dry. 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia. ABG results pending. Possible carbon monoxide poisoning suspected. 03:15: Patient is being transferred to ICU for further management.

    "correct": "The patient's presentation (unresponsiveness, history of possible suicide attempt in a garage with a running car, flushed skin, and low SpO2) strongly suggests carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO has a much higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, displacing oxygen and leading to tissue hypoxia. The priority action is to administer 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask to competitively displace CO from hemoglobin and maximize oxygen delivery to tissues. This is the most immediate and crucial intervention to prevent further hypoxic damage and potential death.",
    "incorrect": "Initiating cardiac monitoring (b) is important for assessing the patient's cardiovascular status, but it does not address the immediate need for oxygenation. Drawing blood for carboxyhemoglobin levels (c) is necessary for confirming the diagnosis, but it delays the critical intervention of oxygen administration. Consulting respiratory therapy for intubation (d) may become necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates despite oxygen administration, but it is not the first action to take. High-flow oxygen is the priority.",
