B: He has a history of hypertension and sleep apnea. He denies any allergies. He has been increasingly lethargic throughout the night. A: At 07:30, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli. His respiratory rate is 6 breaths per minute and shallow, oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally. His heart rate is 50 bpm and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Pinpoint pupils are noted. The patient is not responding to sternal rub. R: I am concerned about opioid-induced respiratory depression. I recommend immediate intervention to support his airway and breathing. Consider administering naloxone and transferring him to the ICU for close monitoring. I will obtain a STAT ABG."

The FIRST action should be to support ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) will provide immediate respiratory support and improve oxygenation until naloxone can take effect. Without adequate ventilation, the patient will develop severe hypoxemia and subsequent brain damage or death.",

Gastric lavage is not indicated at this time. The oxycodone was administered more than four hours ago, and the priority is to address the respiratory depression. While contacting the Rapid Response Team is appropriate, it delays immediate intervention. The nurse must address the respiratory compromise immediately.",
