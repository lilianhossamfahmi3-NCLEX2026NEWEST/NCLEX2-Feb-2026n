Background: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. No prior cardiac events reported. Assessment: The patient is diaphoretic, anxious, and reports substernal chest pain, rated 8/10. Initial ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicative of an inferior STEMI. Vitals: BP is 90/60 mmHg, HR is 110 bpm, RR is 24 breaths/min, and SpO2 is 92% on room air. Labs show elevated Troponin I and CK-MB. Radiology shows no acute abnormalities.
