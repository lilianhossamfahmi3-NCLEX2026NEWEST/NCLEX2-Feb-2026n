Background: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, currently managed with medications. He reports no prior cardiac events. Assessment: Patient is diaphoretic, anxious, and complaining of substernal chest pain rated 8/10. Initial ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Vitals: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Recommendation: STAT cardiology consult and immediate intervention for suspected STEMI. Consider oxygen administration, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine administration. He needs emergent cardiac catheterization. The patient is also very anxious and repeatedly asks, 'Am I going to die?' Continuous monitoring of vitals is essential and keep the patient calm.",

Maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% is generally acceptable unless otherwise indicated. Higher oxygen levels may lead to vasoconstriction and negatively impact outcomes in some MI patients. The patient is currently at 92% on room air which indicates that oxygen is a lower priority than addressing the underlying cause of chest pain and restoring cardiac perfusion."

It's a standard initial intervention in suspected acute coronary syndrome. The SBAR indicates that nitroglycerin is available PRN, and the patient's pain level of 8/10 warrants its administration."

The heart may not be able to handle the increased preload, which could lead to pulmonary edema or worsening of cardiac function. A smaller bolus may be considered if other measures do not improve blood pressure, but it is not the priority."

PCI is generally superior to thrombolytics, as it results in faster and more complete restoration of blood flow, leading to better outcomes.
