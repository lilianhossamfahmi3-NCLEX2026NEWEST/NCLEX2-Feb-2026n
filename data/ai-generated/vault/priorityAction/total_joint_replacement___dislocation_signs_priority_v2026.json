She is currently reporting severe pain in her operative hip, rated 9/10. 07:00: Patient repositioned onto left side to assess surgical dressing and posterior aspect of patient. 07:15: Patient states, \"I felt a pop in my hip when I turned\". \n\nB: Her post-operative course has been unremarkable until now. She has been ambulating with a walker and tolerating oral pain medication. PMH includes hypertension and osteoarthritis. \n\nA: On assessment at 07:20, the affected leg appears shorter than the other and is externally rotated. Neurovascular assessment is intact, with palpable pulses and sensation present. Patient is anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. Pain is unrelieved by current pain medication.\n\nR: I am concerned about a possible hip dislocation. I recommend immediate evaluation by the surgeon and potential reduction of the hip. I have not given any pain medication at this time. Orders for X-ray are needed. What are your orders?"
