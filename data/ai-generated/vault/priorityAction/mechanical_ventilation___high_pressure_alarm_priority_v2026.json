Background: Admitted yesterday for pneumonia, intubated due to respiratory failure. He's on assist-control ventilation, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O, rate 14, tidal volume 450 mL. Assessment: His SpO2 has dropped from 95% to 88% over the last 15 minutes. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has increased from 25 to 40 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally with diminished breath sounds on the left. He appears anxious and is restless. Vitals: HR 110, BP 140/90, RR 28 (ventilator), Temp 38.5°C. Labs pending. Recommendation: I suspect possible mucus plugging or worsening pneumonia. I recommend suctioning and chest X-ray. Consider increasing sedation if his anxiety is contributing. Please advise. The high pressure alarm is continuous and alarming. The patient is showing signs of increased work of breathing despite being mechanically ventilated."

        "correct": "The FIRST action should be to assess the patient's airway. A high-pressure alarm often indicates an obstruction, such as mucus plugging, kinked tubing, or bronchospasm. Assessing the airway by auscultating lung sounds and observing for visible signs of obstruction will help determine the cause of the alarm and guide further interventions. The SBAR indicates the patient is likely experiencing mucus plugging.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing FiO2 is important for hypoxia, but addressing the high-pressure alarm and potential airway obstruction is the immediate priority. Fluid boluses are not indicated for a high-pressure alarm unless hypovolemia is suspected, which is not indicated in the SBAR. Manually ventilating the patient is a consideration if the mechanical ventilator is malfunctioning or if the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly after initial assessment, but assessing the airway is the first and most crucial step.",
