    "correct": "Initiating intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation is the priority in DKA. Dehydration occurs due to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. Rapid rehydration helps restore intravascular volume, improves renal perfusion, and reduces blood glucose levels. Subsequent interventions are dependent on this initial volume resuscitation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering insulin is important but follows initial fluid resuscitation. Addressing the underlying cause of the DKA and monitoring electrolyte levels are crucial but are secondary to immediate volume replacement. Electrolyte imbalances can be exacerbated by insulin administration. While potassium replacement is often needed, it is usually initiated after fluid resuscitation and after reviewing initial potassium values.",
