He's complaining of a severe headache and palpitations.\n\nBackground: Mr. Jones has a history of paroxysmal hypertension. Initial workup included 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines and catecholamines, results pending. He was placed on telemetry monitoring.\n\nAssessment: BP is 220/120 mmHg, HR 120 bpm and regular, RR 24, SpO2 98% on room air. He's anxious and diaphoretic. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds. No chest pain reported. Recent EKG shows sinus tachycardia. Patient reports a throbbing headache rated 8/10.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to lower his blood pressure. We have a standing order for IV phentolamine. Would you like any other medications prescribed or further orders at this time?"

    "correct": "Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to rapidly lower blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma-induced hypertensive crisis. Given the patient's current BP of 220/120 mmHg, the nurse should immediately administer phentolamine per the standing order to prevent end-organ damage. Rapid reduction of blood pressure is essential in this situation.",
    "incorrect": "Notifying the physician is important, but administering the phentolamine per standing order is the priority due to the severity of the hypertensive crisis. Waiting to administer a medication while the blood pressure remains dangerously high could lead to stroke or other complications.\nAssessing the patient's pain level is important for comfort, but lowering the blood pressure is the priority to prevent end-organ damage. Addressing the headache is a secondary concern compared to the immediate threat of a stroke or cardiac event.\nBeta-blockers are contraindicated as the FIRST medication in undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Alpha blockade must occur FIRST, or unopposed alpha stimulation can worsen the hypertensive crisis. Oral medications are also slower acting and inappropriate for this acute situation.",
