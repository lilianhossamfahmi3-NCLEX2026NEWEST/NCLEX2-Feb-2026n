        "correct": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. The priority is to notify the healthcare provider to ensure prompt medical management. Following notification, assess the chest tube system for kinks, occlusions, or disconnections, as these can impede drainage. Prepare for potential interventions such as needle thoracostomy or chest tube re-insertion, as determined by the provider. Finally, administer high-flow oxygen to maximize oxygenation and support respiratory function while awaiting further treatment.",

Increasing the chest tube suction (incorrect) might be considered in some situations, but it is not the immediate priority action for a sudden deterioration. Documenting the findings (incorrect) should occur but after immediate life-saving interventions.",
