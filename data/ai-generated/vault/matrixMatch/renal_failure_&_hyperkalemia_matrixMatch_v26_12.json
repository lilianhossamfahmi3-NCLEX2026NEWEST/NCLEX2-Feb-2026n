Indicate whether each intervention is indicated, contraindicated, or has no effect in this patient's current condition.",

            "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: Mr. Johnson, a 68-year-old male, admitted 2 days ago with acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\nBackground: Initial creatinine was 3.5 mg/dL, now 6.8 mg/dL. Potassium is elevated at 6.9 mEq/L. He's on continuous cardiac monitoring.\nAssessment: Alert but weak. BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, O2 sat 94% on room air. ECG shows peaked T waves. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. Recent Labs: BUN 60 mg/dL, Creatinine 6.8 mg/dL, Potassium 6.9 mEq/L, Sodium 138 mEq/L, Chloride 102 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, Glucose 150 mg/dL.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate treatment for hyperkalemia, considering the ECG changes and declining renal function. Possible interventions include calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), and potentially dialysis if conservative measures fail. Please advise.",

            "Administer calcium gluconate": "Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels directly but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart, stabilizing the myocardial cell membrane and reducing the risk of arrhythmias. This is crucial given the ECG changes.",
            "Administer intravenous furosemide": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes potassium excretion through the kidneys. This is indicated if the patient still has some residual renal function and is not anuric. It helps in eliminating potassium from the body.",
            "Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate)": "Kayexalate exchanges sodium for potassium in the gut, promoting potassium excretion through the feces. It's indicated to lower serum potassium levels, although it may take several hours to have a significant effect.",
            "Administer intravenous insulin and glucose": "Insulin drives potassium into cells, thereby lowering serum potassium levels. Glucose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia. This is a temporary measure to rapidly reduce potassium levels.",
            "Administer oral phosphate binders": "Phosphate binders are used to manage hyperphosphatemia, which is common in renal failure, but they have no direct effect on potassium levels. They are not indicated for acute hyperkalemia.",
            "Initiate sodium bicarbonate infusion": "Sodium bicarbonate can shift potassium into cells, thereby lowering serum potassium levels. This is particularly useful in patients with metabolic acidosis, which is common in renal failure.",
            "Restrict potassium intake": "Restricting potassium intake is essential in managing hyperkalemia. This includes dietary modifications and avoiding medications or fluids high in potassium."
        },
        "clinicalPearls": "In hyperkalemia, always assess the ECG for cardiac changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex) as they can indicate life-threatening arrhythmias. Rapidly acting treatments like calcium gluconate and insulin with glucose should be prioritized. Monitor potassium levels closely after interventions.",
        "questionTrap": "Students often confuse treatments for hyperkalemia with treatments for hyperphosphatemia. Phosphate binders are for hyperphosphatemia, not directly for lowering potassium. Also, some may think that any diuretic is appropriate, but loop diuretics are only effective if the patient still has some kidney function.",
        "mnemonic": "To remember hyperkalemia treatment, use 'C BIG K Drop': Calcium Gluconate (cardioprotection), Bicarbonate, Insulin (with Glucose), Kayexalate, Dialysis."
