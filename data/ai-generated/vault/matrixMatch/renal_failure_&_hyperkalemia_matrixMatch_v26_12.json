        "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: Mr. Johnson, a 68-year-old male, was admitted two days ago for acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\nBackground: His initial creatinine was 3.5 mg/dL, now 6.8 mg/dL. Potassium is elevated at 6.9 mEq/L. He is on continuous cardiac monitoring.\nAssessment: The patient is alert but weak. His BP is 160/95 mmHg, HR is 110 bpm, RR is 24, and O2 sat is 94% on room air. ECG shows peaked T waves. Urine output has decreased to 20 mL/hr. Recent Labs: BUN 60 mg/dL, Creatinine 6.8 mg/dL, Potassium 6.9 mEq/L, Sodium 138 mEq/L, Chloride 102 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, Glucose 150 mg/dL.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate treatment for hyperkalemia, considering the ECG changes and declining renal function. Possible interventions include calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), and potentially dialysis if conservative measures fail. Please advise on the best course of action.",

    "rationale": {
        "Administer calcium gluconate": "Calcium gluconate is indicated to counteract the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart. It does not lower potassium levels but stabilizes the myocardial cell membrane, reducing the risk of arrhythmias. This is crucial given the ECG changes (peaked T waves). clinicalPearl: Monitor ECG continuously during administration. questionTrap: Calcium gluconate only protects the heart; it doesn't lower potassium. mnemonic: 'Calcium' protects the 'Cardiac'.",
        "Administer intravenous furosemide": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes potassium excretion through the kidneys by inhibiting reabsorption in the loop of Henle. This is indicated if the patient still has some residual renal function and is not anuric. It helps eliminate potassium from the body via urine. clinicalPearl: Monitor urine output and potassium levels closely. questionTrap: Furosemide is ineffective in patients with end-stage renal disease. mnemonic: 'Furosemide Flushes' potassium.",
        "Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate)": "Kayexalate exchanges sodium for potassium in the gut, primarily in the large intestine, promoting potassium excretion through the feces. It's indicated to lower serum potassium levels, although it may take several hours to have a significant effect. clinicalPearl: Monitor for constipation and administer with adequate fluids. questionTrap: Kayexalate can cause sodium overload and should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure. mnemonic: 'Kayexalate K Exits' the body.",
        "Administer intravenous insulin and glucose": "Insulin drives potassium into cells by increasing the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, thereby lowering serum potassium levels. Glucose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia. This is a temporary measure to rapidly reduce potassium levels. clinicalPearl: Monitor blood glucose levels frequently. questionTrap: Insulin's effect is temporary; other treatments are needed for sustained potassium reduction. mnemonic: 'Insulin Influxes' potassium into cells.",
        "Administer oral phosphate binders": "Phosphate binders are used to manage hyperphosphatemia, which is common in renal failure, but they have no direct effect on potassium levels. They are not indicated for acute hyperkalemia management. clinicalPearl: Administer with meals to bind dietary phosphate. questionTrap: Confusing phosphate binders with potassium-lowering agents. mnemonic: 'Phosphate Binders Bind Phosphate', not potassium.",
        "Initiate sodium bicarbonate infusion": "Sodium bicarbonate can shift potassium into cells by increasing the pH, which stimulates the Na+/H+ exchanger and subsequently the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This is particularly useful in patients with metabolic acidosis, which is common in renal failure. clinicalPearl: Monitor arterial blood gases (ABGs) to assess acid-base balance. questionTrap: Bicarbonate is less effective if the patient is not acidotic. mnemonic: 'Bicarbonate Buffers' and shifts potassium.",
        "Restrict potassium intake": "Restricting potassium intake is essential in managing hyperkalemia. This includes dietary modifications (avoiding high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes) and avoiding medications or intravenous fluids high in potassium. clinicalPearl: Educate the patient and family about potassium-rich foods. questionTrap: Overlooking hidden sources of potassium in medications and salt substitutes. mnemonic: 'Restrict Rich Potassium' foods.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "In hyperkalemia, always assess the ECG for cardiac changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex) as they can indicate life-threatening arrhythmias. Rapidly acting treatments like calcium gluconate and insulin with glucose should be prioritized. Monitor potassium levels closely after interventions."

        "questionTrap": {
            "trap": "Common Pitfall",
            "howToOvercome": "Students often confuse treatments for hyperkalemia with treatments for hyperphosphatemia. Phosphate binders are for hyperphosphatemia, not directly for lowering potassium. Also, some may think that any diuretic is appropriate, but loop diuretics are only effective if the patient still has some kidney function."
