Multiple victims with varying degrees of injuries are arriving at the ED.\n\n**Background:** Initial reports indicate a wide range of injuries, including fractures, lacerations, respiratory distress, and potential internal injuries. Resources are limited, and a rapid triage process is essential to prioritize care.\n\n**Assessment:**\n*   **Client 1:** 16:02 - 62-year-old male, RR 34, radial pulse present, able to follow simple commands. Obvious femur fracture. \n*   **Client 2:** 16:05 - 8-year-old female, apneic; repositioning airway was unsuccessful. No palpable pulse or respirations.\n*   **Client 3:** 16:08 - 35-year-old female, RR 20, radial pulse present, confused and disoriented. Multiple superficial lacerations and abrasions. \n*   **Client 4:** 16:12 - 45-year-old male, RR 12, radial pulse present, unable to move lower extremities. Complains of severe back pain. \n*   **Client 5:** 16:15 - 25-year-old male, RR 24, radial pulse present, alert and oriented, able to walk. Minor lacerations on arms.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement START triage protocol. Rapidly assess and categorize patients based on RPM (Respirations, Perfusion, Mental Status) to ensure the most critical patients receive immediate attention. Continuous reassessment is vital."
