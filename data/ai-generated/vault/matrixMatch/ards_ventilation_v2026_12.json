Prone positioning (r2) shifts the weight of the heart and abdominal contents away from the posterior lung, improving ventilation-perfusion matching. Low tidal volume (r3) is the gold standard for 'lung protection' to prevent over-stretching of the delicate alveoli (barotrauma). A conservative fluid strategy (r4) helps minimize the alveolar-capillary leak which causes the characteristic pulmonary edema of ARDS.",
