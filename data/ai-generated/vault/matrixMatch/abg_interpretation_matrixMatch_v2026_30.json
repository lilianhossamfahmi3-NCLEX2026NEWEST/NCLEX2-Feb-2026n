He's experiencing increased shortness of breath and productive cough.\nBackground: Mr. Johnson has a long-standing diagnosis of COPD, managed with home oxygen at 2L/min. He reports non-compliance with medications in the past week due to feeling better. He has a smoking history of 60 pack-years.\nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented but appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min and labored. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and coarse crackles bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 88% on 2L/min via nasal cannula. Patient reports increased sputum production, thick and yellow in color. ABG drawn. \nRecommendation: Increase oxygen flow rate as prescribed, administer prescribed bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Monitor respiratory status closely, including repeat ABGs as ordered. Encourage effective coughing and deep breathing exercises. Consult respiratory therapy for further evaluation and management. Re-evaluate ABG after interventions.\n07:30 Increased O2 to 4L/min per protocol. Administered albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatment. Encouraged coughing. \n08:00 Patient reports some improvement in breathing. Repeat ABG drawn to evaluate response to treatment."
