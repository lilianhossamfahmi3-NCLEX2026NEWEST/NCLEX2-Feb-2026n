    "correct": "Cranial nerve assessment helps localize brainstem function and identify potential neurological deficits.\n\n*   **CN II (Optic):** (c1) The Optic nerve transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Testing visual acuity using a Snellen chart assesses the nerve's ability to transmit clear visual signals. Impairment can indicate optic nerve damage or lesions along the visual pathway.\n*   **CN III (Oculomotor):** (c2) The Oculomotor nerve controls most eye movements, including pupillary constriction. Assessing pupil constriction and extraocular movements evaluates the nerve's function in controlling eye muscles and the pupillary light reflex. Damage can lead to ptosis, diplopia, and impaired pupillary response.\n*   **CN VII (Facial):** (c3) The Facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression. Asking the client to smile, frown, and show teeth assesses the nerve's motor function. Weakness or paralysis can indicate facial nerve damage, such as Bell's palsy or stroke.\n*   **CN VIII (Vestibulocochlear):** (c4) The Vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for hearing and balance. Testing hearing via the whisper test or Rinne/Weber tests evaluates the nerve's auditory function. Damage can result in hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo.\n*   **CN XII (Hypoglossal):** (c5) The Hypoglossal nerve controls tongue movement. Asking the client to stick out their tongue and move it side-to-side assesses the nerve's motor function. Deviation of the tongue to one side can indicate hypoglossal nerve damage.",
    "incorrect": "*   Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the specific functions of each cranial nerve. For example, confusing CN V (Trigeminal) with CN VII (Facial) is a common error. CN V is responsible for facial sensation and chewing, while CN VII controls facial expression.",

A: Noted new onset right-sided facial droop and difficulty protruding tongue midline at 1530. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. R: Recommend stat neurology consult and repeat CT scan of the head to rule out acute stroke."
