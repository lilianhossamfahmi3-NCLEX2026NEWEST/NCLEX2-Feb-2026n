History of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. No known allergies.\nAssessment: Noted muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C). Mental status shows agitation and confusion. Heart rate is 120 bpm and blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg. Client reports increased anxiety and restlessness. Denies any other medication use or changes.\nRecommendation: STAT labs drawn and sent. Hold sertraline. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Obtain order for antipyretic medication. Notify provider immediately for further evaluation and potential treatment of suspected serotonin syndrome."

    "correct": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SSRIs, such as sertraline, increase serotonin levels by inhibiting its reuptake. Symptoms include mental status changes (agitation, confusion), autonomic dysfunction (hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension), and neuromuscular abnormalities (muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, tremor, clonus). The EHR data supports this with the elevated temperature, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and the noted muscle rigidity and hyperreflexia.",
