        "content": "**SBAR - Medical Surgical Unit**\n\n**Situation:** Mr. David Lee, a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, was admitted to the medical-surgical unit at 07:00 today with increased shortness of breath, productive cough with thick yellow sputum, and general weakness.\n\n**Background:** Mr. Lee has a known history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He manages his COPD with inhalers at home. He reports that his symptoms have been worsening over the past three days, despite using his inhalers as prescribed. He denies chest pain but reports significant fatigue.\n\n**Assessment:** On admission at 07:00, Mr. Lee was alert but appeared anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds with wheezing in all lung fields. His initial vital signs were: HR 110 bpm, RR 32 breaths/min, BP 160/90 mmHg, SpO2 88% on room air, and Temp 37.8°C (100°F). ABG was drawn at 07:15. He was placed on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula, per physician order. Repeat ABG was drawn at 10:15.\n\n**Recommendation:** Continue to monitor Mr. Lee's respiratory status closely. Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 between 88-92%. Administer medications as prescribed (nebulizer treatments, antibiotics, and corticosteroids). Consider consulting respiratory therapy for further management of his respiratory distress. Monitor blood glucose levels due to steroid administration. Encourage fluid intake to help thin secretions. Assess effectiveness of interventions and report any further deterioration in his condition. Re-evaluate ABGs as needed and notify provider of any significant changes. Educate patient on pursed lip breathing and effective coughing techniques. Elevate head of bed to high fowlers. Encourage rest periods between activities. Monitor sputum characteristics."

In respiratory alkalosis, the pH is high (> 7.45) and the PaCO2 is low (< 35 mmHg), indicating excessive CO2 removal. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low pH (< 7.35) and a low HCO3 (< 22 mEq/L), indicating a deficit of bicarbonate or an excess of acid.
