    "correct": "Narrow therapeutic index drugs require meticulous monitoring to prevent toxicity.\n\n*   **(r1) Lithium:** Lithium is a mood stabilizer primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its narrow therapeutic range necessitates close monitoring to avoid neurotoxic effects. Lithium affects several neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine. Levels above 1.5 mEq/L can lead to significant neurological impairment. **Coarse tremors** are an early sign of lithium toxicity, indicating potential central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction.\n\n*   **(r2) Digoxin:** Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It increases cardiac contractility by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in myocardial cells. This leads to increased intracellular calcium, enhancing myocardial contraction. **Yellow halos or nausea** are classic early signs of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin toxicity can also cause arrhythmias, including bradycardia and heart block. Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity because digoxin binds more readily to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump when potassium levels are low.\n\n*   **(r3) Theophylline:** Theophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and suppressing airway responsiveness to stimuli. Theophylline is a methylxanthine that inhibits phosphodiesterase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which causes bronchodilation. **Tachycardia or seizures** are early signs of theophylline toxicity. Theophylline can also cause nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Its narrow therapeutic window requires careful monitoring to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias and seizures.\n\n*   **(r4) Phenytoin:** Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant used to treat seizures. It works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons, which reduces neuronal excitability and prevents the spread of seizure activity. **Nystagmus (involuntary eye movement)** is an early sign of phenytoin toxicity. Other signs include ataxia (loss of coordination), slurred speech, and confusion. Chronic phenytoin use can lead to gingival hyperplasia (gum overgrowth) and hirsutism (excessive hair growth).",
    "incorrect": "Vancomycin (not shown) also has a narrow therapeutic range (trough 10-20 mcg/mL), but its primary toxicities are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Nephrotoxicity manifests as increased serum creatinine and decreased urine output, while ototoxicity can cause tinnitus and hearing loss. Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin) also share these toxicities.",

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Low potassium levels increase the risk of Digoxin toxicity, even if the Digoxin level is within the therapeutic range. Monitor potassium levels closely in patients taking Digoxin, especially those also on diuretics.",
      "For patients on Phenytoin, good oral hygiene is essential to minimize gingival hyperplasia. Regular dental checkups are recommended.",
      "When administering Lithium, ensure the patient maintains adequate hydration and sodium intake. Dehydration and sodium depletion can increase Lithium levels and the risk of toxicity."

      "assessment": "The nurse identifies the following lab results:\n*   Patient A: Lithium level 1.4 mEq/L, exhibiting coarse tremors.\n*   Patient B: Digoxin level 2.2 ng/mL, reporting nausea and seeing yellow halos.\n*   Patient C: Theophylline level 21 mcg/mL, experiencing tachycardia.\n*   Patient D: Phenytoin level 23 mcg/mL, exhibiting nystagmus.",
      "recommendation": "The nurse should immediately notify the healthcare provider for all four patients. Recommend holding the next dose of each medication and obtaining further orders for repeat lab draws and potential interventions to manage the toxicity. For Patient B (Digoxin), assess potassium levels and administer Digibind if ordered. For Patients C (Theophylline) and D (Phenytoin), consider activated charcoal if appropriate and monitor for seizure activity."
