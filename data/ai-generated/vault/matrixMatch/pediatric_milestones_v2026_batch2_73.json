He has been meeting developmental milestones as expected until now. Assessment: Upon examination, patient A does not roll over independently. Recommendations: Discuss developmental expectations with the mother and schedule a follow-up appointment in 1 month.\n\n08:30 SBAR for patient B. Situation: Patient B is an 18-month-old female presenting for a well-child visit. Background: Patient B was born prematurely at 32 weeks gestation. She has been receiving early intervention services. Assessment: Patient B walks independently but uses a wide-based gait. She speaks approximately 5-10 words. Recommendations: Continue with current therapy and monitor progress.\n\n09:00 SBAR for patient C. Situation: Patient C is a 12-month-old male presenting for a well-child visit. Background: Patient C was born at term with no complications. Assessment: Patient C pulls to stand and cruises along furniture. He babbles and says 'mama' and 'dada' nonspecifically. Recommendations: Encourage continued development and schedule routine 15-month follow up.\n\n09:30 SBAR for patient D. Situation: Patient D is an 6-month-old female presenting for a well-child visit. Background: Patient D was born at term with no complications. Assessment: Patient D sits unsupported, transfers objects hand-to-hand, and babbles. Recommendations: Reassure mother of normal development. Schedule routine 9-month follow up."

    "correct": "Matching milestones to age ranges involves understanding the expected progression of physical and cognitive development in infants. At 6 months, infants typically roll over, sit with support, and begin transferring objects. At 12 months, they pull to stand, cruise, and may say a few words. By 18 months, toddlers walk independently (though gait may still be developing) and have a vocabulary of at least several words.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect age range assignments indicate a misunderstanding of typical developmental progressions. For example, assigning a child who is not rolling over to the 12-month category is incorrect because rolling over is expected much earlier. Assigning a child walking independently with a limited vocabulary to the 6-month category is also incorrect, as walking and more advanced language skills are expected later.",
