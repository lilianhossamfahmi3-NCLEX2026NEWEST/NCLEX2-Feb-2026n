    "correct": "**Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment (Chemobrain):** Chemobrain affects up to 75% of cancer survivors during or after treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation can disrupt normal brain function, leading to inflammation and reduced neurogenesis. This manifests as difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and mental fatigue.\n\n**Peripheral Neuropathy:** Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents damage peripheral nerves, disrupting sensory and motor function. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, burning, and sharp, shooting pains, primarily in the hands and feet. Severity depends on the specific drug, dosage, and individual susceptibility.\n\n**Lymphedema:** Lymphedema results from lymph node removal or damage during surgery or radiation, causing lymphatic fluid buildup in the interstitial space. This leads to chronic swelling, typically in the arm on the side of the mastectomy. The accumulation of protein-rich fluid causes inflammation, fibrosis, and impaired immune function in the affected limb.\n\n**Radiation Pneumonitis/Fibrosis:** Radiation to the chest (for breast or lung cancer) can cause lung-tissue scarring (fibrosis) or acute inflammation (pneumonitis). Radiation damages alveolar cells, triggering an inflammatory response. Over time, this can lead to fibrosis, reducing lung elasticity and gas exchange. Symptoms include shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers may reflect a misunderstanding of the specific late effects of cancer treatment or the underlying pathophysiology. For example, attributing bilateral edema to lymphedema is incorrect, as lymphedema typically presents as asymmetric swelling. Bilateral edema is more indicative of systemic conditions like heart failure or renal insufficiency.",
