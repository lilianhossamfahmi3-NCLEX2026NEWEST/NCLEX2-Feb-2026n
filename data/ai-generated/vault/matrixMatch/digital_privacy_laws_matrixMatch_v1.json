    "correct": "Federal laws determine how nursing data is handled.\n\n**(r1 & r4) HIPAA Security Rule:** This rule mandates technical and physical safeguards to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Encryption ensures data confidentiality during transmission, and administrative standards for password rotation and biometrics control access to systems containing ePHI. *Pathophysiology:* Weak security measures can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of patient confidentiality, potentially causing harm to patients and legal repercussions for the healthcare facility.\n\n**(r2) HITECH Act:** This act expanded HIPAA by adding strict breach notification requirements. Healthcare facilities must notify affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and, in some cases, the media within 60 days of discovering a data breach. *Pathophysiology:* Data breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and emotional distress for patients. Timely notification allows individuals to take steps to mitigate potential harm.\n\n**(r3) HIPAA Privacy Rule:** This rule defines Protected Health Information (PHI) and establishes standards for its use and disclosure. It grants patients rights over their health information, including the right to access, amend, and control the disclosure of their PHI. *Pathophysiology:* The Privacy Rule ensures patient autonomy and control over their health information, promoting trust and fostering a strong patient-provider relationship. Violations can lead to discrimination, stigmatization, and compromised healthcare outcomes.",
    "incorrect": "The Privacy Rule focuses on 'Who' and 'What' regarding PHI access and usage. The Security Rule focuses on 'How' (the technology and processes used to protect PHI). The HITECH Act mandates breach notification.",
