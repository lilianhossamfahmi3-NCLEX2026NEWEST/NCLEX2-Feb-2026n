Parents report he can roll over and sit with support.\nB.C., female, 12 months old, presents for follow-up after URI. Observed to be pulling up to stand and cruising along furniture.\nC.D., male, 18 months old, here for immunization. Parents state he can walk independently and attempts to feed himself with a spoon.\nD.E., female, 9 months old, readmitted for dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. Previously able to transfer objects from one hand to the other and babble.\n\n**07:15**\nS: D.E. appears slightly lethargic upon initial assessment, but is easily roused by verbal stimuli.\n\nB: A.B., B.C., C.D. are stable and within normal limits.\n\nA: Continue to monitor all patients as per standard pediatric protocols.\n\nR: Anticipate discharge planning for A.B. and C.D. Educate parents on age-appropriate milestones and safety precautions. Continue rehydration therapy for D.E. and monitor for improvement. Monitor B.C. for respiratory distress given recent URI diagnosis."
