Background: Admitted yesterday at 16:00 for altered mental status secondary to UTI. She has a history of dementia. Assessment: Ms. Hayes is pulling at her IV line, attempting to climb out of bed, and yelling. She is disoriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs at 06:45: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air, Temp 38.3°C (101°F). Attempted verbal de-escalation without success. The client is at high risk for falls. Orders reviewed: Rule out stroke, administer cefTRIAXone 1 gram IV q24h, obtain urine culture, initiate fall precautions. Recommendation: I recommend considering a restraint order to ensure patient safety, given her current agitation and risk of self-harm. Awaiting orders from Dr. Smith. 07:15 Dr. Smith verbally ordered restraints PRN for patient safety; order transcribed and awaiting cosignature. Notified family of patient's increased agitation and need for restraints. 07:20 Attempted to re-orient patient again with negative results. Patient continues to display unsafe behaviors. \n\nUpdate 07:30: Dr. Smith signed orders for haloperidol 5mg IM PRN q4h for agitation and wrist restraints PRN."
