        "correct": "Labor is divided into four distinct stages, each characterized by specific physiological events. \n\n*   **(r1) First Stage:** Begins with the onset of true labor contractions and ends with complete cervical dilation (10 cm). This stage involves cervical effacement and dilation, allowing the fetus to descend into the birth canal. The duration varies significantly among individuals and between pregnancies.\n\n*   **(r2) Second Stage:** Starts when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the infant. This stage involves active pushing by the mother to facilitate fetal descent and expulsion.\n\n*   **(r3) Third Stage:** Begins immediately after the birth of the infant and ends with the delivery of the placenta. Uterine contractions continue to separate the placenta from the uterine wall, and it is then expelled.\n\n*   **(r4) Fourth Stage:** The immediate postpartum period, lasting approximately 1-4 hours after placental delivery. This stage is crucial for maternal physiological stabilization, including monitoring for hemorrhage, vital signs, and uterine involution.",

She received an epidural for pain management during labor.\"\n*   **Assessment:** \"Her fundus is boggy and located 2 cm above the umbilicus, deviated to the right. Lochia rubra is heavy with several small clots. Vital signs are stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 99% on room air.\"\n*   **Recommendation:** \"I recommend assessing her bladder for distention and considering an order for oxytocin to help contract the uterus.

Uterine contractions, driven by oxytocin and prostaglandins, cause cervical effacement and dilation. Fetal descent is facilitated by uterine contractions and maternal pushing efforts. Placental separation occurs due to uterine contractions after birth, leading to placental expulsion. The fourth stage involves uterine involution and hemostasis, preventing postpartum hemorrhage. Failure of any of these mechanisms can lead to complications such as dystocia, fetal distress, or postpartum hemorrhage."
