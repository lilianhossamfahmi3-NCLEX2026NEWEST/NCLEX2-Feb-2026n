She was admitted yesterday for observation following a fall at home. **Background:** Ms. Vance has a history of hypertension and mild osteoarthritis. She lives alone and has been increasingly withdrawn over the past few months. The fall occurred while she was reaching for a book on a high shelf. **Assessment:** Patient is alert and oriented x3. Auscultation reveals slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Noted drooling and weak cough. Speech is slurred and difficult to understand. Grip strength is reduced in her right hand compared to her left. **Recommendation:** Request evaluation by Speech Therapy for swallowing and speech assessment. Occupational Therapy consult for assessment of fine motor skills and home safety. Social Work referral to address potential social isolation and explore available community resources. Physical Therapy consult for mobility and balance assessment. Notify Dr. Montague with any significant changes."
