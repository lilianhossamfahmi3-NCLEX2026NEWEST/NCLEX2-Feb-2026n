States, \"They are stealing my shoes!\" \n**07:15** B: Admitted 3 days ago for UTI treatment. History of falls at home. No known psychiatric history prior to admission. \n**07:15** A: Client's agitation is escalating. Attempted verbal de-escalation without success. Vital signs stable (HR 92, BP 138/82, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air). Neuro assessment reveals disorientation to time and place. Risk for falls and potential for violence towards staff. Exhibiting picking behavior. \n**07:30** R: Requesting order for restraint to ensure safety. Recommend starting with least restrictive measures, but anticipate need for either physical or chemical restraint. Need to prevent falls and protect staff. Notify provider if escalation continues despite intervention."
