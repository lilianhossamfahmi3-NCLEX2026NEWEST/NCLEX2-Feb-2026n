He is experiencing increased shortness of breath and productive cough with thick, yellow sputum.\n\nBackground: Mr. Olsen has a history of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He uses home oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula. He was diagnosed with pneumonia 3 days ago by his primary care physician, treated with oral antibiotics, but his symptoms have worsened.\n\nAssessment: The patient is alert but anxious. Respiratory rate is 32 breaths/min and labored, with accessory muscle use. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and coarse crackles bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 88% on 2L NC. He is diaphoretic. Patient complains of headache.\n\nRecommendation: Request order for ABG to assess acid-base balance and oxygenation. Consider increasing oxygen delivery, nebulized bronchodilators, and chest physiotherapy. Monitor respiratory status closely. Contact provider with ABG results."
