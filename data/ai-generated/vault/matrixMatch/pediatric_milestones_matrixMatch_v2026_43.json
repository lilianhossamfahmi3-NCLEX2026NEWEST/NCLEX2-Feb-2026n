Parents report he is generally healthy and meeting milestones. No acute concerns reported today.\n\n**Background (14:32):** Michael was born at term, with no complications during pregnancy or delivery. He is up-to-date on his vaccinations. He is primarily breastfed, supplemented with pureed foods. Parents deny any allergies. Previous weight and height were within normal limits. He sits unsupported. Rolls from tummy to back. Babbles frequently.\n\n**Assessment (14:45):** Physical exam reveals a healthy, active infant. He is alert and responsive. Weight and height are appropriate for age. He is able to transfer objects from one hand to the other. He does not yet crawl. He pulls to stand briefly while holding onto furniture. He is able to say \"mama\" and \"dada\" nonspecifically. He responds to his name.\n\n**Recommendation (14:50):** Continue current feeding plan. Encourage floor time to promote crawling. Follow-up appointment scheduled for 12 months. Review anticipatory guidance for safety and nutrition. Discuss upcoming vaccinations. Answer any parental questions/concerns. Parents verbalize understanding and agreement with plan."
