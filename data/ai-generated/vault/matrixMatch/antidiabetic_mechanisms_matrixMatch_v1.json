    "correct": "Modern diabetes management targets multiple pathways. \n\n*   **(r1) GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Semaglutide):** These medications mimic the effects of incretin hormones, which are released in response to food intake. They slow gastric emptying (c2), increasing satiety and reducing postprandial glucose excursions. This mechanism also indirectly suppresses appetite, contributing to weight loss. \n\n*   **(r2) SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Canagliflozin):** These drugs work in the kidneys by blocking the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubule. This prevents the reabsorption of glucose back into the bloodstream, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine (c1) and a reduction in blood glucose levels. \n\n*   **(r3) Sulfonylureas (e.g., Glyburide):** Sulfonylureas stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to release more insulin (c4), regardless of blood glucose levels. This mechanism carries a high risk of hypoglycemia (c5) because insulin secretion is not directly tied to glucose concentrations. \n\n*   **(r4) Biguanides (Metformin):** Metformin primarily works by decreasing hepatic glucose production (c3). It also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and reduces intestinal glucose absorption.",
