        "correct": "Modern diabetes management targets multiple pathways.\n\n*   **(r1) GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Semaglutide):** These medications mimic incretin hormones, released after eating. They slow gastric emptying (c2), increasing satiety and reducing postprandial glucose spikes, which can indirectly suppress appetite and contribute to weight loss.\n\n*   **(r2) SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Canagliflozin):** These drugs block the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidneys, preventing glucose reabsorption. This leads to increased glucose excretion in the urine (c1) and lower blood glucose levels.\n\n*   **(r3) Sulfonylureas (e.g., Glyburide):** Sulfonylureas stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release more insulin (c4), regardless of blood glucose levels. This carries a higher risk of hypoglycemia (c5) because insulin secretion isn't directly linked to glucose concentrations.\n\n*   **(r4) Biguanides (Metformin):** Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production (c3). It also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and reduces intestinal glucose absorption.",
