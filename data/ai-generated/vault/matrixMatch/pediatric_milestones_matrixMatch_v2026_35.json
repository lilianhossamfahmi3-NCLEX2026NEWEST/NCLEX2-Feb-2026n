Parents have a few questions about feeding and sleeping habits.\nBackground: Michael was born full-term with no complications. He has been meeting most developmental milestones, according to the parents. He received all recommended vaccinations at his 6-month appointment. Parents report Michael is generally healthy, with occasional mild colds.\nAssessment: On examination, Michael is alert, active, and appears to be developing normally. He sits unsupported and is starting to crawl. He babbles frequently, using sounds like 'mama' and 'dada' without specific intent. He shows interest in toys and objects around him, attempting to reach for them. He pulls himself to stand while holding onto furniture. Parents report he sleeps through the night most nights, with occasional wake-ups.\nRecommendation: Continue to monitor Michael’s development. Discuss feeding strategies, emphasizing iron-rich foods. Reinforce the importance of upcoming vaccinations. Address parental concerns regarding sleep patterns and offer guidance. Schedule next appointment for 12-month check-up."
