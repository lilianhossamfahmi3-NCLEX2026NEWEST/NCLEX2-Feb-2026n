        "content": "**07:00** SBAR for Mr. Javier Ramirez, DOB 03/15/1978. Room 312.\n\n**Situation:** Mr. Ramirez is a 48-year-old male admitted yesterday with severe pneumonia complicated by ARDS. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Oxygen saturation remains suboptimal despite current settings.\n\n**Background:** Patient initially presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. He was started on antibiotics, but respiratory status worsened, requiring intubation. Initial vent settings: FiO2 60%, TV 500 mL, RR 16, PEEP 5 cm H2O.\n\n**Assessment:** As of 06:45, vital signs: HR 122, BP 100/60, RR 18 (ventilated), SpO2 89% on current settings. ABG: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58, HCO3 24. Peak inspiratory pressure is 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally, more pronounced in the lower lobes. Patient is on continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl.\n\n**Recommendation:** Considering the persistent hypoxemia and ABG results, recommend the following:\n1.  Increase PEEP to improve oxygenation.\n2.  Consider prone positioning to redistribute lung perfusion.\n3.  Assess for any signs of barotrauma or pneumothorax.\n4.  Monitor ABGs closely after any ventilator changes.\n\n-- Nurse Amy Chen, RN"
