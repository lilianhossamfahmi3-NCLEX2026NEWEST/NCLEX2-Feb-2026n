        "content": "07:00 SBAR for Mr. Allen:\nSituation: Mr. Allen, a 45-year-old male, reports fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal pain. He was recently diagnosed with Hepatitis A after attending a crowded music festival.\nBackground: Mr. Allen denies any IV drug use or blood transfusions. He reports eating questionable street food at the festival.\nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented. Jaundice is present. Abdomen is tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Liver enzymes are elevated (see lab results).\nRecommendation: Continue supportive care, monitor liver function, and provide education on preventing the spread of Hepatitis A. \n\n07:15 SBAR for Ms. Baker:\nSituation: Ms. Baker, a 32-year-old female, presents for a routine check-up. She is a healthcare worker and reports accidental needle stick 6 months ago.\nBackground: Ms. Baker tested positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). She had not completed the Hepatitis B vaccine series prior to the needlestick.\nAssessment: Patient is asymptomatic. Liver enzymes are within normal limits. She is concerned about potential long-term complications.\nRecommendation: Refer to infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management. Discuss the possibility of antiviral therapy.\n\n07:30 SBAR for Mr. Carter:\nSituation: Mr. Carter, a 58-year-old male, presents with chronic liver disease symptoms including ascites and edema. He reports a history of IV drug use in his 20s.\nBackground: Mr. Carter has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C. He denies current drug use.\nAssessment: Patient has significant ascites and lower extremity edema. Liver enzymes are elevated. He is being evaluated for liver transplant.\nRecommendation: Continue current treatment regimen, including diuretics and low-sodium diet. Monitor for complications of cirrhosis.\n\n07:45 SBAR for Mr. Davis:\nSituation: Mr. Davis, a 28-year-old male, presents for STD screening. He reports multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex.\nBackground: Screening is negative for HIV and Syphilis. Hepatitis B surface antigen is positive. Reports previously declined Hep B vaccine due to 'not wanting to get sick from vaccine'.\nAssessment: Patient is asymptomatic. Liver enzymes are within normal limits.\nRecommendation: Refer to infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management. Counsel on safe sex practices."
