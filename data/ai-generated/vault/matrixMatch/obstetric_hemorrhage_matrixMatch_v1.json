        "correct": "Differentiating between placental abruption and placenta previa is critical for fetal and maternal well-being.\n\n**(r1 & r4) Placenta Previa:** Characterized by painless, bright red vaginal bleeding due to the placenta partially or completely covering the cervical os. The uterus remains soft and non-tender because the bleeding originates from placental vessels near the cervix, not from uterine contractions or placental separation.\n\n**(r2, r3, & r5) Placental Abruption:** Involves premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. This leads to dark red vaginal bleeding (though concealed hemorrhage is possible) and severe abdominal pain due to uterine contractions and blood accumulating within the myometrium (Couvelaire uterus). The abdomen becomes rigid and board-like due to uterine irritability and tetany. Risk factors like cocaine use and maternal hypertension contribute to placental abruption due to vasoconstriction and damage to placental blood vessels. This vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the placenta, increasing the risk of separation.\n\n**Pathophysiology Deep Dive:**\n*   **Placenta Previa:** The placenta's abnormal location near or over the cervix predisposes it to tearing and bleeding as the cervix effaces and dilates, especially during the third trimester. Because the placenta is not contracting, the uterus remains soft.\n*   **Placental Abruption:** The initiating event is often rupture of maternal blood vessels in the decidua basalis (the uterine lining beneath the placenta). This leads to hematoma formation, which separates the placenta from the uterine wall. The separation can be partial or complete. The bleeding irritates the uterus, causing contractions and pain. In severe cases, the blood can infiltrate the myometrium, leading to a Couvelaire uterus and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).",
        "incorrect": "Bleeding in abruption can sometimes be 'concealed,' meaning there is NO visible blood despite a severe internal hemorrhage. This occurs when the blood is trapped behind the placenta. Consider other signs like sudden onset of intense abdominal pain, uterine rigidity, and fetal distress.",
