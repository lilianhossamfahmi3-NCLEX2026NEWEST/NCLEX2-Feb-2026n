    "correct": "Accurate waveform interpretation is critical for appropriate medication administration, especially vasopressors. (r1) A normal arterial waveform exhibits a rapid upstroke during systole, followed by a clear dicrotic notch, which represents aortic valve closure and the beginning of diastole. (r2) An overdamped waveform lacks a distinct dicrotic notch, and the systolic peak appears slurred or rounded. This occurs when the dynamic response of the system is reduced, leading to underestimation of systolic pressure and overestimation of diastolic pressure. Pathophysiologically, overdamping can be caused by obstructions or compliance issues within the system. (r3) An underdamped waveform displays excessive oscillations or 'ringing' after a fast-flush test. This is due to an exaggerated dynamic response, leading to overestimation of systolic pressure and underestimation of diastolic pressure. This can be caused by long tubing or stiff tubing. (r4) Air bubbles within the pressure tubing are compressible, absorbing pressure energy and resulting in an overdamped signal.",
    "incorrect": "Underdamped signals usually overestimate the systolic blood pressure, while overdamped signals underestimate it. This can lead to inappropriate medication administration and compromise patient safety.",

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "The first action for an overdamped waveform is to check for kinks in the tubing, air bubbles, or blood clots at the catheter tip. Then, perform a fast-flush test. For underdamped waveforms, assess for excessive tubing length or non-compliant tubing. Ensure all connections are tight and free of leaks.",
