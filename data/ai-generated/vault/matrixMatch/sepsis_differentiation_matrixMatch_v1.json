    "correct": "Accurate differentiation of septic stages is vital for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.\n\n*   **Client A (Sepsis):** The client exhibits signs of infection (elevated temperature and WBC count) coupled with new-onset confusion, indicating organ dysfunction. Sepsis is defined as infection plus organ dysfunction. The body's response to infection triggers a systemic inflammatory response, leading to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and activation of the coagulation cascade. In the brain, inflammation and impaired perfusion can manifest as altered mental status.\n\n*   **Client B (Septic Shock):** The client presents with hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) that is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and requires vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to maintain a MAP >65 mmHg. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction. The profound vasodilation and capillary leak characteristic of sepsis lead to decreased preload and afterload, resulting in hypotension. Norepinephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is used to increase vascular tone and improve blood pressure.\n\n*   **Client C (Sepsis & Septic Shock):** The client has an elevated lactate level (4.5 mmol/L), a doubling of creatinine from baseline (indicating acute kidney injury), and an elevated INR (>1.5), suggesting coagulopathy. Elevated lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoperfusion, a hallmark of sepsis and septic shock. Acute kidney injury results from decreased renal perfusion and direct inflammatory damage to the renal tubules. Coagulopathy, reflected by an elevated INR, is caused by the activation of the coagulation cascade and impaired liver function.\n\n*   **Client D (MODS):** The client exhibits failure of multiple organ systems, including the lungs (pulmonary edema requiring ventilation), kidneys (AKI requiring dialysis), and liver (hepatic failure). MODS is characterized by the failure of two or more organ systems due to uncontrolled systemic inflammation and microcirculatory dysfunction. The inflammatory mediators damage the endothelium, leading to increased capillary permeability, edema, and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. This results in cellular hypoxia and organ failure.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   Sepsis alone does not involve refractory hypotension (Shock) or multi-system collapse (MODS) as the primary definition. MODS is the terminal progression of unresolved shock.\n*   Failing to recognize the progression of sepsis can lead to delayed interventions and increased mortality.\n*   Incorrectly identifying the stage of sepsis can result in inappropriate treatment strategies.",
