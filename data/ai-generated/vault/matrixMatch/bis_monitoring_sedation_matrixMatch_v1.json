        "correct": "BIS monitoring utilizes EEG data to quantify a client's level of consciousness during anesthesia or sedation. The BIS score ranges from 0 (complete absence of brain activity) to 100 (fully awake).\n\n*   **(r1) BIS Value: 100 → (c1) Fully Awake / Alert:** A BIS value of 100 indicates that the client is fully conscious, alert, and responsive. There is no sedation effect.\n*   **(r2) BIS Value: 40-60 → (c3) General Anesthesia (Ideal):** This range is the target for general anesthesia. It indicates a state of unconsciousness where the client is unlikely to have recall of events. The goal is to maintain this range to prevent awareness during surgery while avoiding excessive sedation.\n*   **(r3) BIS Value: Less than 40 → (c4) Deep Hypnotic State / Burst Suppression:** A BIS value below 40 indicates a very deep level of sedation, potentially leading to burst suppression on the EEG. This level of sedation is generally avoided unless specifically indicated, as it can increase the risk of complications.\n*   **(r4) BIS Value: 70-90 → (c2) Moderate / Conscious Sedation:** This range represents a state of moderate sedation, where the client is relaxed and may respond to verbal commands or light stimuli. It is often used for procedures where the client needs to be comfortable but not completely unconscious.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect matches indicate a misunderstanding of the correlation between BIS values and the corresponding level of sedation or anesthesia. Factors such as patient-specific responses to medications, pre-existing neurological conditions, and the use of certain drugs (e.g., ketamine) can influence BIS readings. It's crucial to consider these factors when interpreting BIS values.\n\nFor example, a BIS value might be artificially elevated in a patient taking ketamine, potentially leading to an underestimation of the depth of sedation.",

Anesthesia was induced at 1400 with propofol and rocuronium.\nAssessment: At 1415, the BIS value is 75. The client is showing slight movement and an increase in heart rate from 70 to 85 bpm.\nRecommendation: Increase the propofol infusion rate per anesthesia protocol to achieve a BIS target of 40-60. Reassess the BIS value and vital signs in 5 minutes. Consider administering a bolus of propofol if the BIS value does not decrease sufficiently. Communicate changes to the anesthesia provider at 1420."
