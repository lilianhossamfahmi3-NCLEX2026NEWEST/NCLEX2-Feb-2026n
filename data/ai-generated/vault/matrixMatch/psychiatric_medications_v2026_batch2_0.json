Admitted three days ago for increased psychotic symptoms. \n**09:00** A: Client exhibiting signs of akathisia and possible early signs of EPS. Vital signs stable. Neuro assessment reveals cogwheel rigidity. Administered benztropine 2mg PO per order. Monitored for changes. \n**11:00** S: Client reports persistent headache and nausea after lunch. Slight diaphoresis noted. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n**11:30** B: Client is also prescribed phenelzine 45mg PO daily for treatment-resistant depression. Started two weeks ago. Dietary education provided upon initiation of medication. \n**11:30** A: BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 110 bpm. Suspect possible interaction with tyramine-containing food despite education. Notified provider. Placed on cardiac monitoring. Neuro checks q1h. \n**13:00** R: Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status closely. Hold next dose of phenelzine per physician order.

    "correct": "Typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like akathisia (restlessness and inability to sit still) and muscle stiffness due to dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway. MAOIs, like phenelzine, can cause hypertensive crisis when interacting with tyramine-containing foods or other medications that increase norepinephrine levels. Symptoms include elevated blood pressure, headache, and diaphoresis.",
    "incorrect": "SSRIs are primarily associated with serotonin syndrome (confusion, agitation, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia) and sexual dysfunction. While atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of EPS compared to typical antipsychotics, they are more associated with metabolic syndrome (weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia). Tricyclic antidepressants can cause anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention) and cardiac arrhythmias.",
