    "correct": "Knowing antidotes is crucial for patient safety.\n\n*   **(r1) Protamine sulfate neutralizes Heparin:** Heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents clot formation. Protamine sulfate, a positively charged molecule, binds to negatively charged heparin, forming a stable complex and inactivating its anticoagulant activity. This occurs rapidly, usually within 5 minutes.\n\n*   **(r2) Vitamin K and PCC reverse Warfarin:** Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X). Vitamin K is a slow reversal agent, taking several hours to days to replenish these factors. Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) contains pre-formed clotting factors, providing a rapid reversal of warfarin's effects, typically within minutes. PCC is preferred in cases of severe bleeding or the need for urgent surgery.\n\n*   **(r3) Naloxone is the opioid antagonist:** Opioids bind to opioid receptors in the brain, causing respiratory depression, sedation, and analgesia. Naloxone is a competitive opioid antagonist that blocks these receptors, reversing the effects of opioids. It rapidly restores respiratory function, usually within 1-2 minutes.\n\n*   **(r4) Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepine sedation:** Benzodiazepines enhance the effects of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, leading to sedation, anxiety reduction, and muscle relaxation. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse sedation and respiratory depression but should be used cautiously due to the risk of seizures, especially in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use.\n\n*   **(r5) Calcium gluconate is used for magnesium toxicity:** Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant used to prevent seizures in pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Magnesium toxicity can cause respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and cardiac arrest. Calcium gluconate antagonizes the effects of magnesium by increasing the threshold potential of excitable cells, counteracting the neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of hypermagnesemia.",
    "incorrect": "Mismatching antidotes can be fatal. For example, administering Vitamin K for Heparin will not stop the bleeding and could delay appropriate treatment. Each antidote is specific to the medication or substance it reverses. Using the wrong antidote can lead to continued toxicity and potentially life-threatening complications.",

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Flumazenil can trigger seizures in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use or in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Monitor patients closely for seizure activity after flumazenil administration.",
      "PCC carries a risk of thromboembolic events due to the rapid increase in clotting factors. Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disorders.",
      "When administering naloxone, be prepared for the patient to experience withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia. Start with small doses and titrate to effect to avoid severe withdrawal.",
      "Calcium gluconate should be administered slowly to avoid cardiac arrhythmias. Monitor the patient's ECG during administration.",
