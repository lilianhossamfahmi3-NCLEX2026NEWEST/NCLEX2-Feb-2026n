    "correct": "Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) regulate the body's metabolic rate. In hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's), decreased thyroid hormone production leads to a slowed metabolic rate. This results in (r1) cold intolerance due to decreased heat production and weight gain due to decreased calorie expenditure. (r4) Constipation occurs due to slowed gastrointestinal motility, dry skin results from decreased sweat and oil gland activity, and a 'slug-like' mental status is due to decreased brain activity. In hyperthyroidism (Grave's disease), excessive thyroid hormone production leads to an accelerated metabolic rate. This results in (r2) tachycardia and palpitations due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and heat intolerance due to increased heat production. (r3) Exophthalmos, a hallmark of Grave's disease, is caused by inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat. Pretibial myxedema is another specific manifestation of Grave's disease, characterized by subcutaneous swelling on the anterior lower legs. (r5) Thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism characterized by extreme hypermetabolism.",
