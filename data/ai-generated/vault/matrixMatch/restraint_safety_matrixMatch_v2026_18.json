Attempted de-escalation techniques ineffective. \n\n14:15: Contacted provider, Dr. Lee, regarding patient's escalating behavior. Order received for haloperidol 5mg IM PRN agitation. \n\n14:30: Haloperidol 5mg IM administered. Patient continues to exhibit aggressive behavior, attempting to pull out IV line. \n\n14:45: Provider notified of continued agitation despite medication. New order received for physical restraints to ensure patient safety and prevent harm to self and staff. Explained the need for restraints to the patient, who refused and continued to be combative.\n\n15:00: Implemented physical restraints per hospital policy. Secured extremities to bed frame with soft restraints. Frequent monitoring initiated, including circulation, skin integrity, and patient's emotional state. \n\n15:15: Patient continues to be agitated. Offered oral fluids, which patient refused. Reassuring patient and explaining all procedures. \n\n15:30: Provider at bedside, reassessing patient. New order received to increase haloperidol to 7.5mg IM PRN agitation. \n\n15:45: Haloperidol 7.5mg IM administered. Patient is still agitated but less combative. Continue to monitor vital signs and restraint safety. \n\n16:00: Patient is beginning to calm down. Continue to monitor closely. Notified Dr. Lee of patient's status."
