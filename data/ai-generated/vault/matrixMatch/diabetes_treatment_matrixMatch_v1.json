    "correct": "Medication timing determines efficacy and safety in diabetes management. \n\n(r1) Rapid-acting insulin (Lispro) has a rapid onset of action (15-30 minutes) and should be administered within 15 minutes of starting a meal to prevent hypoglycemia. Lispro mimics the body's natural insulin response to a meal, quickly lowering blood glucose levels. The pathophysiology involves the rapid absorption of Lispro into the bloodstream, facilitating glucose uptake by cells. If food intake is delayed after administration, the insulin can cause a dangerous drop in blood sugar.\n\n(r2) Short-acting insulin (Regular) has a slower onset of action (30-60 minutes) compared to rapid-acting insulin. It should be administered 30-60 minutes before a meal to allow the insulin to start working as the body begins to absorb glucose from the food. Regular insulin binds to insulin receptors, promoting glucose uptake and utilization. The timing is crucial to match the insulin's peak effect with the rise in blood glucose after eating. \n\n(r3) Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, works by slowing down the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. It should be taken with the first bite of each main meal to be most effective. Acarbose competitively inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine, delaying the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into glucose. This reduces the postprandial glucose surge. Taking it without food will not have the desired effect on glucose absorption.\n\n(r4) Metformin is commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea. Taking it with meals can help to reduce these side effects. Metformin primarily works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. While it doesn't directly affect carbohydrate absorption like acarbose, taking it with food can slow the rate of absorption and reduce the intensity of GI distress.",
    "incorrect": "Taking Acarbose without food is ineffective because it works by slowing carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine. It needs to be present when food is ingested to exert its effect.",

      "Educate patients on the importance of consistent carbohydrate intake when using rapid-acting and short-acting insulins to prevent hypoglycemia."
