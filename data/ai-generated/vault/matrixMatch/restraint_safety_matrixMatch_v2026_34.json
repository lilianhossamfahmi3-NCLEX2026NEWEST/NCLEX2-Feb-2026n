Attempted to climb out of bed. \n\nBackground (07:05): Dementia diagnosis 3 years ago. Lives at home with wife. UTI confirmed via urinalysis. Currently on IV antibiotics. No known allergies. History of falls.\n\nAssessment (07:10): Restless, disoriented to time and place. Speech is loud and rapid. Skin intact. IV site without redness or swelling. Vitals: BP 160/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. Exhibiting aggressive behavior, striking out at staff. States, 'Get away from me! I don't know you!'\n\nRecommendation (07:15): Requesting order for restraint to prevent falls and disruption of IV therapy. Consider chemical restraint if agitation persists despite redirection and environmental modifications. Will continue to monitor vitals, skin integrity, and neuro status every 15 minutes. Notified Dr. Smith at 07:15."

This monitoring helps prevent complications such as nerve damage, impaired circulation, or skin breakdown. Regular assessment and documentation of CSM are critical components of safe restraint use."

Haloperidol can have significant neurological side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). A baseline assessment is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions and to ensure the medication is appropriate for the client's condition. Furthermore, this medication requires a physician order."
