Reports increased shortness of breath and productive cough with thick yellow sputum. Oxygen saturation 88% on 2L nasal cannula. \n\n07:15: Auscultated lungs. Diffuse wheezing and crackles noted bilaterally. Client using accessory muscles to breathe. Complains of feeling anxious and restless. \n\n07:30: Increased oxygen to 4L nasal cannula. Encouraged pursed-lip breathing. Notified respiratory therapy for evaluation. \n\n08:00: Respiratory therapy arrived and initiated nebulizer treatment with albuterol/ipratropium. Repeat oxygen saturation 92%. \n\n08:30: Client states feeling slightly better after nebulizer treatment. Still reports shortness of breath. New ABG order received and sample sent to lab.\n\n09:00: ABG results received. Notified provider of results and awaiting further orders. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status ongoing."
