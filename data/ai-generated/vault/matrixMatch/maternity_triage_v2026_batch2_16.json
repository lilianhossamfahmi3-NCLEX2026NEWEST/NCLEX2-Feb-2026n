Client C reports blurred vision and a severe headache. Client D states she thinks her water broke at home approximately 2 hours ago but denies contractions. \n\nBackground: Client A is 28 years old, G1P0, at 32 weeks gestation. Client B is 35 years old, G2P1, at 36 weeks gestation. Client C is 25 years old, G1P0, at 38 weeks gestation. Client D is 30 years old, G1P0, at 39 weeks gestation. All clients have had routine prenatal care. Client A and B deny any medical problems. Client C has a history of migraines but reports this headache is different. Client D has no known allergies.\n\nAssessment: See vital signs and physical exam tabs for individual client data. Client C's BP is significantly elevated.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate evaluation by the physician for Client C due to potential pre-eclampsia. Client D requires assessment to confirm rupture of membranes and monitor for labor progression. Clients A and B can be assessed in turn based on resource availability."
