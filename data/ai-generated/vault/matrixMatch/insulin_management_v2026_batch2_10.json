Patient reports adherence to insulin regimen but notes increased stress lately. \n**B:** Patient has been managing diabetes for 20 years with consistent insulin therapy. Recent HbA1c was 8.5%. Home medications include insulin glargine 20 units daily at bedtime and insulin lispro 5 units before meals, adjusted per sliding scale. \n**A:** 08:00: Blood glucose 280 mg/dL. Insulin lispro 6 units administered per sliding scale. Patient reports feeling slightly thirsty. 10:00: Blood glucose 220 mg/dL. Patient denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia. 12:00: Blood glucose 180 mg/dL. Lunch administered. Insulin lispro 4 units administered per sliding scale. 16:00: Blood glucose 250 mg/dL. \n**R:** Continue to monitor blood glucose levels every 4 hours and administer insulin lispro per sliding scale. Educate patient on stress management techniques and their impact on blood glucose control. Notify provider if blood glucose remains above 300 mg/dL."
