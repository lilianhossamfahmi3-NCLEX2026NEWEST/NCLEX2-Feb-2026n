        "content": "**06:00** SBAR for Ms. Eleanor Vance (DOB: 03/15/1948) in Room 312.\n\n**Situation:** Ms. Vance, a 78-year-old female, was admitted yesterday at 14:00 for exacerbation of COPD and community-acquired pneumonia. She is currently on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula.\n\n**Background:** Ms. Vance has a history of COPD, hypertension, and a recent stroke (3 months ago) affecting her right side. She lives alone and was found on the floor by her neighbor after a reported fall. She completed her antibiotic dose of ceftriaxone this morning.\n\n**Assessment:** The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but she exhibits some difficulty with speech and swallowing. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally. The patient's right-sided weakness is still present. She has expressed frustration with her mobility and difficulty performing ADLs. Aspiration precautions are in place. The patient's SpO2 is stable at 94% on 2L NC. A slight tremor is noted in her right hand. She is able to ambulate 10 feet with a walker but becomes easily fatigued.\n\n**Recommendation:** Considering her speech and swallowing difficulties, right-sided weakness, and need for assistance with ADLs, I recommend referrals to Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy for comprehensive evaluation and treatment. Social Work consult is also recommended to assess her living situation and need for assistive devices or home healthcare services. Continue monitoring respiratory status and vital signs. Repeat swallow evaluation is needed."
