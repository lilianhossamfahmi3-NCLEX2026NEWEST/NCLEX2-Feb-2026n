Denies any significant medical history. Prenatal care has been consistent and unremarkable to date. Reports feeling fetal movement. \nAssessment: Patient appears anxious but is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits except for slightly elevated blood pressure (142/88 mmHg). Light vaginal bleeding noted on peripad. Fetal heart tones auscultated at 140 bpm. Reports intermittent lower back pain, rated 4/10. States, \"I've had back pain before, but the spotting is new.\"\nRecommendation: Assess patient for preterm labor. Obtain urine sample for protein. Monitor vital signs and fetal heart tones continuously. Notify provider of assessment findings and patient's concerns. Consider further evaluation for preeclampsia given elevated blood pressure and reported spotting. \n14:15: Patient denies headache or visual changes at this time.\n14:20: Patient reports increased lower back pain. Rate now 6/10."
