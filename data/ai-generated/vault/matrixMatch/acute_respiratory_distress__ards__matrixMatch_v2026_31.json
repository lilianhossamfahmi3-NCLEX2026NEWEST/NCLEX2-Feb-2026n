FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O, tidal volume 400 mL. Saturation fluctuating 88-92%. Increased respiratory effort noted. ABG from 06:30 shows pH 7.32, PaCO2 48 mmHg, PaO2 62 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, slightly worsened since yesterday.\n**07:15** Physician ordered to initiate prone positioning. All safety checks completed. Patient tolerated proning well. \n**08:00** Repositioned patient to prone position. Monitoring vital signs closely. Slight improvement in oxygen saturation to 93-94% noted. Suctioned small amount of thick secretions.\n**08:30** Skin assessment completed, no new areas of breakdown noted. Continue to monitor and reposition every 2 hours as per protocol. \n**09:00** Repeat ABG drawn. Continuing to monitor respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as prescribed. Will update physician with new ABG results.\n**09:30** New ABG results received: pH 7.35, PaCO2 46 mmHg, PaO2 70 mmHg, HCO3 25 mEq/L. Oxygen saturation maintaining 94-95% in prone position. Physician notified. Orders received to maintain current ventilator settings and prone positioning schedule. Continue to monitor respiratory status closely."
