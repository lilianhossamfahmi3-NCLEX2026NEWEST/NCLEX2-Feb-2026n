    "correct": "Milestones occur in a predictable cephalocaudal (head-to-toe) and proximodistal (center-outward) pattern.\n\n*   **Sitting unsupported (6-8 months):** This milestone reflects the development of core strength and balance. Infants develop the ability to control their trunk muscles, allowing them to maintain an upright seated position without assistance. This is a crucial step towards increased mobility and exploration of their environment.\n*   **Walking independently (12 months):** Independent walking signifies significant gross motor skill development. The child has developed sufficient lower extremity strength, coordination, and balance to take steps without support. Neurologically, this involves maturation of the cerebellum and motor cortex.\n*   **Cooperative play (4 years):** Cooperative play involves children interacting with each other in a shared activity, taking turns, and following rules. This requires advanced social-emotional development, including empathy, communication skills, and the ability to negotiate and compromise. The prefrontal cortex plays a key role in regulating these social interactions.\n*   **Using 2-3 word sentences (2 years):** This milestone indicates significant language development. The child has acquired a vocabulary of approximately 50-200 words and can combine them to express simple ideas and needs. This reflects the maturation of language centers in the brain, such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas.",
