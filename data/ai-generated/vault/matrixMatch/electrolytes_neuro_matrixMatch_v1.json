        "correct": "Electrolyte imbalances significantly impact neurological and muscular function due to their role in nerve impulse transmission and cellular fluid balance.\n\n*   **Hyponatremia (Na+ < 135 mEq/L) and Seizures, stupor, and cerebral edema:** Hyponatremia causes water to move into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. This disrupts normal neuronal function, resulting in neurological symptoms such as seizures and altered mental status (stupor).\n*   **Hypernatremia (Na+ > 145 mEq/L) and Extreme thirst, dry mucous membranes, and 'sticky' tongue:** Hypernatremia results in cellular dehydration as water moves out of cells. This dehydration affects tissues, including the mouth and brain. The body stimulates thirst to restore fluid balance. Severe hypernatremia can lead to confusion, lethargy, and coma.\n*   **Hypermagnesemia (Mg2+ > 2.5 mEq/L) and Decreased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), bradycardia, and lethargy:** Elevated magnesium levels suppress neuronal excitability and neuromuscular transmission, leading to decreased DTRs, muscle weakness, and lethargy. Bradycardia occurs due to the effect of magnesium on cardiac conduction.\n*   **Hypomagnesemia (Mg2+ < 1.3 mEq/L) and Increased DTRs, tremors, and Torsades de Pointes arrhythmia:** Hypomagnesemia increases neuronal excitability and enhances neuromuscular transmission. This leads to increased DTRs, muscle tremors, and potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes.",
        "incorrect": "The symptoms of low magnesium can sometimes mimic those of hypocalcemia (Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs) due to the interconnectedness of these electrolytes in cellular function. However, the key differentiator is the presence of cardiac arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes, which are more specifically associated with hypomagnesemia.",
