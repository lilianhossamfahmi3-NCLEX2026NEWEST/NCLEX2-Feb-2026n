    "correct": "Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The side affected dictates the primary symptoms. \n\n(r1) Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) and orthopnea are classic signs of left-sided heart failure.  When lying down, fluid redistributes from the extremities to the lungs, exacerbating pulmonary congestion. This increased fluid in the lungs causes shortness of breath, especially at night (PND) or when lying flat (orthopnea).\n\n(r2) Jugular venous distension (JVD) and peripheral edema are hallmarks of right-sided heart failure. Right-sided failure causes blood to back up into the systemic venous circulation, leading to increased pressure in the jugular veins (JVD) and fluid accumulation in the tissues (peripheral edema).\n\n(r3) Ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity) and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) are also indicative of right-sided heart failure.  The increased venous pressure from right-sided failure causes fluid to leak into the peritoneal space (ascites) and congestion of the liver (hepatomegaly).\n\n(r4) Audible crackles (rales) in the lung bases are a key finding in left-sided heart failure.  The backup of blood into the pulmonary circulation causes fluid to leak into the alveoli, producing the characteristic crackling sound upon auscultation.\n\n(r5) Fatigue and decreased cardiac output are systemic consequences common to both left- and right-sided heart failure, though often originating from left-sided dysfunction. The heart's inability to pump effectively reduces oxygen delivery to the tissues, leading to fatigue.",
