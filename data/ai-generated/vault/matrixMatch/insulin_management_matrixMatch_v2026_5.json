Administered 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate (4 oz apple juice) per protocol. \n\n14:20: Rechecked capillary blood glucose: 85 mg/dL. Provided client with a snack of crackers and cheese. Educated client on recognizing symptoms of hypoglycemia and appropriate treatment. \n\n07:00: Routine morning assessment completed. Client reports feeling well. Blood glucose check pending. Insulin due at 07:30. Dietician visited client to reinforce diabetic diet. \n\n07:30: Administered insulin per MAR. Client tolerated injection well. Encouraged client to eat breakfast promptly after injection. \n\n08:00: Client consuming breakfast without difficulty. Monitored for any signs of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
