        "correct": "CVC complications demand swift recognition and intervention.\n\n*   **Venous Air Embolism (r1):** The classic 'mill-wheel' murmur is pathognomonic for air entering the right ventricle. Air obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to acute right heart strain, dyspnea, and hypotension. The rapid decrease in cardiac output triggers compensatory mechanisms, but these are often insufficient to maintain adequate perfusion.\n\n    *   *Pathophysiology:* Air introduced into the venous system travels to the right atrium and ventricle. The churning of air and blood creates the characteristic murmur. Air can block the pulmonary artery, causing a sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and a decrease in left ventricular preload. This leads to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.\n\n*   **Pneumothorax (r2):** Insertion, particularly via the subclavian or internal jugular route, carries the risk of puncturing the pleura. Absent breath sounds on the affected side, coupled with pleuritic pain, are hallmark signs.\n\n    *   *Pathophysiology:* Accidental puncture of the pleura during CVC insertion allows air to enter the pleural space, collapsing the lung. The collapsed lung impairs gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Pleuritic pain arises from irritation of the parietal pleura.\n\n*   **CLABSI (r3):** Central line-associated bloodstream infections are a major concern. Redness, purulent drainage at the insertion site, and fever developing several days post-insertion are indicative of infection.\n\n    *   *Pathophysiology:* Microorganisms, often skin flora, migrate along the catheter tract into the bloodstream. The catheter surface provides a biofilm where bacteria can adhere and proliferate, protected from host defenses and antibiotics. This leads to a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in fever, elevated white blood cell count, and potentially sepsis.\n\n*   **Infiltration/Extravasation (r4):** Shoulder pain and swelling near the insertion site suggest the catheter has migrated or perforated the vessel wall, allowing fluid to leak into surrounding tissues.\n\n    *   *Pathophysiology:* The catheter tip exits the vein, allowing infusate to enter the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. This can cause localized swelling, pain, and tissue damage, depending on the type of fluid infused. Some medications can cause severe tissue necrosis if extravasated.",
        "incorrect": "The 'mill-wheel' murmur is specific to air embolism and not heard in pneumothorax or infection. Pneumothorax presents with respiratory symptoms, not a 'mill-wheel' murmur. CLABSI develops over days, not immediately after insertion. Shoulder pain is not a primary symptom of CLABSI. Infiltration presents with localized symptoms, not systemic ones like fever.",
