    "correct": "Defense mechanisms are unconscious psychological strategies employed to protect the ego from anxiety and maintain a sense of psychological equilibrium. They can be adaptive or maladaptive depending on the context and frequency of use.\n\n*   **(r1) Displacement:** Displacement involves redirecting emotions, often negative ones, from the original source to a less threatening target. In this case, the client's anger towards the doctor (the actual source of frustration) is redirected towards the nurse, who is perceived as a safer outlet. The underlying pathophysiology involves the ego's attempt to reduce anxiety by shifting the emotional burden.\n\n*   **(r2) Reaction Formation:** Reaction formation involves transforming unacceptable impulses or feelings into their opposite. The client's hatred for their sibling is unconsciously converted into excessive affection and protectiveness. This defense mechanism serves to mask the true, unacceptable feelings and prevent them from reaching conscious awareness. The pathophysiology involves the ego's attempt to manage conflicting emotions by expressing the opposite of what is truly felt.\n\n*   **(r3) Projection:** Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to another person. The client, who is habitually late, accuses their spouse of being late, thereby projecting their own tardiness onto their partner. This defense mechanism allows the individual to disown their undesirable qualities and attribute them to someone else. The pathophysiology involves the ego's attempt to alleviate anxiety by externalizing unacceptable aspects of the self.\n\n*   **(r4) Rationalization:** Rationalization involves creating seemingly logical or socially acceptable explanations to justify unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The client, who was denied a promotion, claims they did not want the extra stress anyway. This defense mechanism helps to maintain self-esteem by providing a more palatable explanation for a disappointing outcome. The pathophysiology involves the ego's attempt to protect self-esteem by distorting reality.\n",
