  "stem": "A 62-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with hyperglycemia and altered mental status. Initial laboratory results indicate severe dehydration, with a diagnosis of Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome (HHS). The patient exhibits lethargy, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, elevated blood glucose of 850 mg/dL, serum osmolality of 340 mOsm/kg, and electrolyte imbalances (Na 150 mEq/L, K 3.2 mEq/L). He is hypotensive (BP 90/60 mmHg) and tachycardic (HR 110 bpm). Match the following interventions to their priority level in managing this patient's condition.",

    "correct": "Fluid resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline is the first priority to address severe dehydration and improve perfusion. Potassium replacement is also a first priority due to the patient's hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Intravenous insulin infusion is the second priority to reduce hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis, but should be initiated after fluid resuscitation has begun and potassium levels are addressed.",
    "incorrect": "Delaying fluid resuscitation can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ damage. Delaying potassium replacement can lead to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Initiating insulin before addressing fluid volume and potassium can worsen hypovolemia and hypokalemia.",
