    "correct": "Heparin and warfarin have different mechanisms and onset of action. Heparin provides immediate anticoagulation, whereas warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. Initiating warfarin while continuing heparin allows for a smooth transition to long-term anticoagulation. An elevated aPTT indicates the heparin is therapeutic. An INR within the target range of 2-3 indicates therapeutic warfarin levels. Overlap therapy is continued until the INR is therapeutic for at least 24 hours. The patient should be monitored for bleeding during this time.",
    "incorrect": "Discontinuing heparin immediately is incorrect because warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. Increasing the warfarin dose without monitoring the INR is dangerous and can lead to over-anticoagulation and bleeding. Waiting for the INR to be at 4.0 is too high and increases the risk of bleeding. The INR target range for warfarin is typically 2.0 to 3.0. Continuing heparin for only 1 day may not provide adequate anticoagulation until warfarin becomes therapeutic. Monitoring the aPTT is important while the patient is on heparin.",
