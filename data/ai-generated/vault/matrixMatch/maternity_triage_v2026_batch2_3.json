She also mentions feeling 'fluttering' in her lower abdomen.\n\nBackground: Patient has a history of mild gestational hypertension, managed with close monitoring. Previous pregnancy was uncomplicated, resulting in a full-term vaginal delivery. Denies any recent trauma, falls, or contractions.\n\nAssessment: Patient appears anxious. BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F), SpO2 98% on room air. Reports headache as 7/10, located in the frontal area. Reflexes 3+ bilaterally. Fetal heart rate (FHR) via Doppler is 140 bpm. Light vaginal bleeding noted. \n\nRecommendation: STAT labs (CBC, CMP, UA, Coags). Continuous electronic fetal monitoring. Notify OB/GYN immediately for evaluation and potential magnesium sulfate administration. Prepare for potential seizure management. Consider need for expedited delivery if condition worsens. Strict I/O monitoring."
