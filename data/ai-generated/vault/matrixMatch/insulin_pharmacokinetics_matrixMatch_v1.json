    "correct": "Timing is critical for insulin safety and effectiveness. \n\n(r1) Rapid-acting insulins (e.g., lispro, aspart) have a rapid onset, allowing for administration immediately before or even after meals. This mimics the body's natural insulin response to food intake. The rapid onset is due to modifications in the insulin molecule that prevent self-aggregation, allowing for faster absorption from the subcutaneous tissue.\n\n(r2) Short-acting insulin (Regular) has a slightly longer onset than rapid-acting insulin, requiring administration 30-60 minutes before meals. Regular insulin can also be administered intravenously in emergency situations like DKA due to its predictable and relatively short duration of action. The mechanism involves binding to insulin receptors on cells, facilitating glucose uptake.\n\n(r3) Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) has a delayed onset and a pronounced peak, making it suitable for covering insulin needs between meals and overnight. NPH insulin is a suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, which slows down its absorption and prolongs its duration of action. The peak effect requires careful monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia.\n\n(r4) Long-acting insulins (e.g., glargine, detemir) provide a basal level of insulin with a relatively flat profile, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. Glargine forms microprecipitates upon injection, slowly releasing insulin over 24 hours. Detemir is modified with a fatty acid chain that binds to albumin, further prolonging its action.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect insulin timing can lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Long-acting insulin (Glargine) should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other insulin because it can alter its absorption and duration of action. Mixing insulins can affect their individual pharmacokinetic profiles, leading to unpredictable blood glucose control.",
