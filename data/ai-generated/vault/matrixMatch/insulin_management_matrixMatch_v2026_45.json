Background: He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed 10 years ago. He reports inconsistent insulin administration due to lifestyle factors. Assessment: Blood glucose at 14:00 is 320 mg/dL. He reports feeling thirsty and has frequent urination. He is alert and oriented x 3. Vitals: HR 92, BP 130/80, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F. Skin is warm and dry. He states he took his last insulin dose (10 units of Lispro) at 08:00 this morning. He states that he skipped his Lantus this morning because he woke up late. Recommendation: Continue to monitor blood glucose levels every 2 hours. Administer insulin as prescribed per sliding scale. Educate the patient on the importance of consistent insulin administration and lifestyle modifications. Consult diabetes educator."
