            "SBAR": "**07:00**\n**Situation:** Maria Rodriguez, a 68-year-old female, admitted 3 days ago for heart failure exacerbation.\n**Background:** History of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and lives alone. Presented with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. Initial treatment included IV diuretics, oxygen therapy, and dietary modifications. Symptoms have improved, and she is now stable for discharge.\n**Assessment:** Current vital signs: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. Weight decreased by 6 lbs since admission. Mild edema remains in ankles. Client expresses concern about managing medications and diet at home, difficulty affording medications, and transportation to follow-up appointments. She also mentions feeling isolated and lacking social support. States she relies on public transportation and the local food bank.\n**Recommendation:** Discharge teaching on medication adherence, low-sodium diet, and daily weight monitoring. Arrange a home health visit for medication reconciliation and assessment of functional status. Connect with a social worker to address financial concerns, transportation needs, and social support resources. Provide information on local support groups and community resources for seniors. Schedule a follow-up appointment with cardiology in 2 weeks.",

Social connections are vital for mental and physical health, improving adherence to treatment plans.\n\n**Transportation Barrier:** Arranging transportation removes a significant barrier to accessing healthcare. Without reliable transportation, Maria may miss follow-up appointments, impacting her ability to manage her chronic conditions effectively.\n\n**Food Insecurity:** A registered dietitian can help Maria develop a meal plan that is both heart-healthy and affordable, addressing her food insecurity. Dietary adherence is essential for managing heart failure and diabetes.\n\n**Financial Strain:** Assisting with prescription assistance programs directly addresses her financial strain, improving her access to necessary medications. Medication adherence is critical for preventing heart failure exacerbations and managing her other chronic conditions.\n\n**Health Literacy:** Providing written materials on heart failure management and medication adherence improves her health literacy, empowering her to actively participate in her care. Understanding her condition and treatment plan promotes better self-management and adherence.",
