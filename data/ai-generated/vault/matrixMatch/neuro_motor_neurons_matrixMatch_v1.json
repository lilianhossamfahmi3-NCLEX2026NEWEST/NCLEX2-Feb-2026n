        "correct": "Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) lesions occur in the brain or spinal cord, disrupting the signals that control voluntary movement. This leads to spasticity (increased muscle tone), hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes), and a positive Babinski sign (dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of the other toes in response to plantar stimulation). Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) lesions occur in the peripheral nerves or the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, disrupting the signals that directly stimulate muscles. This leads to muscle atrophy (wasting), fasciculations (involuntary muscle twitches), and flaccid paralysis (loss of muscle tone) with absent reflexes (hyporeflexia).",
