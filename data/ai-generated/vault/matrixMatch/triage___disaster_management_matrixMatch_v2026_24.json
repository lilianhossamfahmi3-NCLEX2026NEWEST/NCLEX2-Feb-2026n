Multiple casualties reported, first responders on scene, and patients are being transported to area hospitals. \n\n08:15 Report: Triage protocols initiated. Incoming patients are being rapidly assessed and categorized using the START triage system. Resources are stretched thin; rapid decision-making is crucial.\n\n08:30 Report: Expecting a surge of critical patients in the next hour. Maintaining accurate documentation and efficient patient flow is paramount. Continuous reassessment is necessary as patient conditions can change rapidly. Ensure clear communication with the medical command center.\n\n08:45 Report: High acuity patients are being sent to OR. Requesting additional ventilators and chest tube insertion kits. Need to prioritize patients with treatable conditions to maximize survival. Document all interventions and patient responses meticulously.\n\n09:00 Report: Triage continues; re-evaluating patients every 15 minutes. Ensure adequate pain management for patients with significant injuries. Monitor for signs of shock and respiratory distress closely. Report any changes in patient status immediately. \n\n09:15 Report: Need additional personnel to assist with documentation. Triage is ongoing. Ensure all patients have been assigned a triage tag. Continuous monitoring and reassessment ongoing. \n\n09:30 Report: Continue re-evaluating patients every 15 minutes. Ensure adequate pain management for patients with significant injuries. Monitor for signs of shock and respiratory distress closely. Report any changes in patient status immediately. \n\n09:45 Report: Ensure all patients have been assigned a triage tag. Continuous monitoring and reassessment ongoing. All patients who are tagged black are moved to the morgue per protocol."
