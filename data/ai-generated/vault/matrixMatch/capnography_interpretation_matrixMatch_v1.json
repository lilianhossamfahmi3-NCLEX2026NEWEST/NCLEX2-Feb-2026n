    "correct": "Capnography provides real-time information about a patient's ventilation and indirectly, their perfusion and metabolism.\n\n*   **Hypoventilation from opioid overdose (Increased EtCO2):** Opioids depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to a decreased respiratory rate and tidal volume. This results in less CO2 being exhaled, causing CO2 to accumulate in the blood and alveolar spaces, leading to an elevated EtCO2 (>45 mmHg). The pathophysiology involves reduced alveolar ventilation relative to metabolic CO2 production.\n\n*   **Hyperventilation due to pain or anxiety (Decreased EtCO2):** Pain and anxiety stimulate the respiratory center, increasing respiratory rate and tidal volume. This leads to excessive CO2 exhalation, resulting in a decreased EtCO2 (<35 mmHg). The pathophysiology involves increased alveolar ventilation relative to metabolic CO2 production.\n\n*   **Sudden loss of the waveform (Flatline/Dislodgement):** A sudden loss of the EtCO2 waveform indicates a complete cessation of CO2 delivery to the sensor. This can be caused by several factors, including esophageal intubation, ventilator disconnection, cardiac arrest (no CO2 being produced or transported), or dislodgement of the endotracheal tube. The pathophysiology involves a complete interruption of CO2 transport from the tissues to the lungs and then to the sensor.\n\n*   **Gradual 'stair-stepping' increase in EtCO2 levels (Increased EtCO2):** A gradual increase in EtCO2 suggests a progressive decrease in ventilation or an increase in CO2 production. This can be seen in conditions like malignant hyperthermia (increased metabolic rate and CO2 production), rebreathing of CO2 (faulty ventilator circuit), or worsening respiratory depression. The pathophysiology involves either increased CO2 production exceeding the body's ability to eliminate it or a reduction in alveolar ventilation relative to CO2 production.",
    "incorrect": "A low EtCO2 reading does not always indicate 'good' breathing. It can be caused by hyperventilation, decreased cardiac output (e.g., pulmonary embolism), or other conditions that impair CO2 delivery to the lungs. Relying solely on EtCO2 without considering the clinical context can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.",
