Multiple victims with varying degrees of injuries.\n08:05 Background: Initial reports indicate over 50 casualties. Resources are stretched thin. Triage protocols initiated.\n08:10 Assessment:\n- Client A: 62-year-old female, RR 32, SpO2 90% on room air, radial pulse present, confused and agitated.\n- Client B: 25-year-old male, RR 10, no radial pulse, unresponsive.\n- Client C: 45-year-old male, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air, radial pulse present, abrasion on arm, able to follow commands.\n- Client D: 8-year-old female, RR 0, no pulse, no response to painful stimuli.\n- Client E: 30-year-old female, RR 24, SpO2 95% on room air, strong radial pulse, femur fracture, severe pain.\n08:15 Recommendation: Continue rapid triage and initiate appropriate interventions based on START triage protocol. Communicate frequently with the incident commander to optimize resource allocation. Document all assessments and interventions accurately. Request additional support if needed.\n08:20 Prioritize immediate transport for Red tagged patients. Prepare Yellow tagged patients for delayed transport. Direct Green tagged patients to a designated safe area for self-care. Confirm Black tagged patients with medical control prior to moving to morgue.\n"
