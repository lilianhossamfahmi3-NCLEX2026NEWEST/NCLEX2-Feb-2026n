        "content": "14:00 SBAR for Ms. Eleanor Vance, DOB 03/15/1948. \nSituation: Ms. Vance presented to the ED today with increasing shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. She reports difficulty breathing when lying flat and has had a persistent cough for the past week. \nBackground: Ms. Vance has a history of heart failure (HF), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. She has been managing her conditions with medications at home, but reports inconsistent medication adherence over the past month due to feeling better. \nAssessment: On admission, vital signs were: BP 170/98 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min with labored breathing, SpO2 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally in the lower lung fields. She has 3+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. Weight is up 5 lbs since her last clinic visit two weeks ago. Patient reports orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\nRecommendation: I recommend administering furosemide 40 mg IV STAT, monitoring oxygen saturation and respiratory effort, and placing her on a cardiac monitor. Also, request an order for a chest x-ray and BMP. We need to reinforce the importance of medication adherence and dietary sodium restriction with the patient. Notified Dr. Ramirez at 14:15, orders received and implemented.\nRegistered Nurse, A. Smith"
