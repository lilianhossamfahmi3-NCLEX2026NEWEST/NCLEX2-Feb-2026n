Reports increasing pain. \n\n14:00: Ruptured membranes spontaneously at 13:45; fluid clear with moderate amount. EFW 3500g by Leopold's maneuvers. Initial FHR 140 bpm with moderate variability. Cervix 6 cm, 90% effaced, 0 station.\n\n14:30: Noted a decrease in FHR to 110 bpm during a contraction, returning to baseline after the contraction ended. Contraction duration 70 seconds.\n\n14:45: FHR now showing repetitive decelerations that begin after the peak of the contraction and return to baseline after the contraction ends. Maternal BP stable at 120/80 mmHg, pulse 88 bpm.\n\n15:00: Noted variable decelerations in FHR down to 80 bpm lasting approximately 45 seconds. Repositioned patient to left lateral position with slight improvement. Oxygen initiated via face mask at 10 L/min.\n\n15:15: Persistent variable decelerations continue despite position change and oxygen administration. Notified Dr. Chen of FHR changes and interventions. Amnioinfusion is being considered.\n\n15:30: Dr. Chen performed a sterile vaginal exam. Noted a possible nuchal cord. Prepare for possible emergency C-section if FHR does not improve.\n"

Late decelerations are indicative of uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning that the fetus is not receiving enough oxygen and nutrients from the placenta. Variable decelerations are often caused by umbilical cord compression, leading to a sudden drop in FHR.",
