Michael is up-to-date on vaccinations. He is primarily breastfed with some introduction to pureed foods. No known allergies.\nAssessment: Vitals stable (see Vitals tab). Physical exam reveals a healthy, active infant. He is able to sit unsupported and is beginning to crawl. He babbles frequently but does not yet say specific words. He demonstrates stranger anxiety and reaches for his mother when approached. He is able to transfer objects from one hand to the other. He is currently teething; mother reports increased drooling and irritability.\nPlan: Continue to monitor growth and development. Reinforce anticipatory guidance regarding nutrition, safety, and upcoming developmental milestones. Administer scheduled vaccinations. Discuss sleep patterns and address any parental concerns. Schedule next well-child visit at 12 months. Provide resources for early intervention services if needed. Emphasize importance of a safe home environment to prevent falls and injuries as mobility increases. Encourage continued interaction and play to promote cognitive and social development. Provide written materials regarding age-appropriate activities to stimulate development. Answer all questions and address concerns.\nSigned, RN"
