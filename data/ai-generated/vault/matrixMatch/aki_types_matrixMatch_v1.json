        "correct": "Prerenal AKI (r1 & r4): Prerenal AKI results from decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Hypotension, dehydration, and hemorrhage reduce renal perfusion. The kidneys respond by retaining sodium and water, leading to a high BUN:creatinine ratio (>20:1) and low urine sodium. The body is trying to compensate for the decreased volume.\n\nIntrarenal AKI (r2): Intrarenal AKI involves direct damage to the kidney tubules. Nephrotoxic substances like contrast dye and aminoglycosides cause acute tubular necrosis (ATN), impairing kidney function. The BUN:creatinine ratio is typically lower (<15:1) or normal because both BUN and creatinine are equally affected.\n\nPostrenal AKI (r3): Postrenal AKI is caused by obstruction of urine outflow. BPH and kidney stones block the ureters, increasing pressure in the kidneys and impairing function. This backflow of urine damages the nephrons.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect matches indicate a misunderstanding of the underlying cause of AKI. Intrarenal AKI typically presents with a lower BUN:Cr ratio because the kidney's ability to filter both BUN and creatinine is equally impaired.
