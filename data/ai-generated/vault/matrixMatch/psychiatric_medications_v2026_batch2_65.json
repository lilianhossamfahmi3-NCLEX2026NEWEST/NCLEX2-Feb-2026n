He was admitted 3 days ago for a manic episode.\n\n**Background:** Mr. Avery has been on haloperidol 5mg PO BID for the past two days. His psychiatric history includes lithium use, which was discontinued due to non-compliance. He has no known allergies. \n\n**Assessment:** Patient is restless, pacing, and exhibiting lip smacking and tongue protrusion. Vital signs are stable: BP 130/80, HR 92, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F (37°C). Neurological assessment reveals cogwheel rigidity and a shuffling gait. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score is 8. Patient reports feeling ‘stiff’ and ‘unable to sit still.’\n\n**Recommendation:** I recommend the provider evaluate Mr. Avery for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and consider discontinuing or reducing the haloperidol dosage. Benztropine 1mg IM was administered at 06:45 per PRN order for acute dystonia. Monitor for further EPS symptoms and therapeutic response to benztropine. Consider alternative medication management for bipolar disorder to minimize EPS risk. Notify provider of AIMS score.\n\nRN: Jane Doe"

    "correct": "Typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to their dopamine receptor blockade in the basal ganglia. Lip smacking, tongue protrusion (tardive dyskinesia), muscle rigidity, shuffling gait (pseudoparkinsonism), and restlessness (akathisia) are all manifestations of EPS. The SBAR notes specifically mention these symptoms along with the administration of benztropine, an anticholinergic medication used to treat EPS.",
    "incorrect": "SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) primarily affect serotonin levels and are more commonly associated with side effects such as nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. While serotonin syndrome is a potential risk, the presented symptoms are more indicative of EPS. MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) can cause hypertensive crisis when interacting with tyramine-rich foods or certain medications. While they can have neurological effects, the specific symptoms of lip smacking, tongue protrusion, muscle rigidity, and shuffling gait are not typically associated with MAOIs.",
