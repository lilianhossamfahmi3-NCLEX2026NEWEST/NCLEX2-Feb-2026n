Cardiovascular risk assessment is also indicated.\n*   David needs lung cancer screening given his smoking history. Colon cancer screening is essential, and evaluation of GERD symptoms should be considered.\n*   Sarah requires cervical cancer screening and STI screening due to her age and sexual activity. Routine blood pressure and cholesterol checks are also important.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nSchedule Maria for mammogram, bone density scan, and lipid panel. Schedule David for low-dose CT scan, colonoscopy, and discuss GERD management. Schedule Sarah for Pap smear, STI screening, and blood pressure/cholesterol check. – Nurse Jane Doe, RN"
