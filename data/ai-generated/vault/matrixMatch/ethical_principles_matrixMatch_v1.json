    "correct": "Ethical principles are fundamental to nursing practice, guiding decision-making in complex situations. \n\n*   **Autonomy:** (r1) Respecting a client's autonomy means acknowledging their right to self-determination and supporting their choices, even if they differ from the nurse's or healthcare team's recommendations. This stems from the belief that individuals have the capacity to make informed decisions about their own bodies and lives. Impairment of autonomy can occur due to cognitive deficits, coercion, or lack of information.\n*   **Beneficence:** (r2) Beneficence involves acting in the client's best interest by promoting their well-being and preventing harm. This principle requires nurses to consider the potential benefits and risks of interventions and to choose the course of action that maximizes positive outcomes. It is rooted in the ethical theory of utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize overall happiness and well-being.\n*   **Non-maleficence:** (r3) Non-maleficence is the obligation to avoid causing harm to clients. This principle requires nurses to carefully assess the potential risks of interventions and to take precautions to minimize harm. It is closely related to the concept of negligence, which occurs when a healthcare professional fails to provide the standard of care, resulting in harm to the client. \n*   **Justice:** (r4) Justice refers to the fair and equitable distribution of resources and treatment to all clients, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or other factors. This principle requires nurses to advocate for policies and practices that promote health equity and to challenge systemic barriers to care. Inequities in healthcare access and outcomes can arise from social determinants of health, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of education.\n*   **Veracity:** (r5) Veracity is the duty to be truthful and honest with clients. This principle requires nurses to provide accurate and complete information about the client's condition, treatment options, and potential risks and benefits. It is essential for building trust and fostering a therapeutic relationship. Deception or withholding information can undermine client autonomy and erode trust in the healthcare system.",
