Currently receiving Pitocin at 2 milliunits/min, increased every 30 minutes per protocol.\nBackground: Pt's prenatal course was uncomplicated. GBS negative. Initial cervical exam: 1 cm, 50% effaced, -3 station. Epidural in place since 12:00, providing adequate pain relief per patient report.\nAssessment: 14:00: Contractions every 3-4 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds, moderate strength. FHR baseline 135 bpm with moderate variability. Noted decelerations on the fetal heart rate tracing. \n14:05: Decelerations now present with nadir matching peak of contraction. \n14:15: Decelerations noted with abrupt drop and return to baseline; timing varies with contractions.\n14:20: Decelerations start after the peak of the contraction, returning to baseline after contraction ends.\nRecommendation: Continue to monitor maternal and fetal status closely. Increase IV fluid rate per protocol to address possible hypovolemia. Notify provider if decelerations persist or worsen. Consider repositioning patient to left lateral position."
