    "correct": "Burn depth is a critical determinant of fluid loss, infection risk, and overall prognosis. Accurate classification guides appropriate treatment strategies.\n\n*   **(r1)** First-degree (superficial) burns affect only the epidermis. The injury disrupts the superficial layers, leading to vasodilation and inflammation. Clinical findings include redness (erythema), pain, and blanching with pressure. There are no blisters because the damage is limited to the epidermis. *Pathophysiology: Epidermal damage triggers the release of inflammatory mediators, causing vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area.* \n*   **(r2)** Second-degree (partial thickness) burns involve the epidermis and a portion of the dermis. Damage to the dermis results in fluid leakage and blister formation. Exposed nerve endings cause intense pain. *Pathophysiology: Dermal damage leads to increased capillary permeability, resulting in fluid extravasation and blister formation. Nerve endings are exposed, leading to heightened pain sensitivity.* \n*   **(r3)** Third-degree (full thickness) burns destroy the epidermis and dermis, extending into subcutaneous tissue. Nerve endings are destroyed, resulting in a lack of pain in the affected area. The skin appears dry, leathery, waxy-white, or charred. *Pathophysiology: Complete destruction of skin layers eliminates nerve function, leading to anesthesia in the affected area. Loss of skin integrity disrupts thermoregulation and barrier function.* \n*   **(r4)** Fourth-degree (deep full thickness) burns extend beyond the subcutaneous tissue, involving muscle, fascia, and bone. These burns are life-threatening and require extensive surgical intervention. *Pathophysiology: Extensive tissue destruction leads to systemic complications, including shock, organ failure, and death. Surgical intervention is necessary to remove necrotic tissue and promote healing.*",
    "incorrect": "Absence of pain in a burn area should not be interpreted as a minor injury. It often indicates deep tissue and nerve destruction, characteristic of third- or fourth-degree burns.",

    "assessment": "The nurse is currently evaluating the burn characteristics, including depth, extent (using the Rule of Nines), and location, to classify the degree of burn and estimate the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected.

    "recommendation": "Based on the burn classification and TBSA, I recommend initiating fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula, administering pain medication (morphine 4mg IV), and preparing for potential intubation due to facial burns and possible inhalation injury. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and urine output is crucial."
