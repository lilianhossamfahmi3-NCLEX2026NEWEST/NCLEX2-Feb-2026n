        "content": "07:00 SBAR for Mr. James Olsen, DOB 03/15/1968. \nSituation: Mr. Olsen is a 58-year-old male admitted for exacerbation of schizoaffective disorder. He has been increasingly agitated and exhibiting disorganized thoughts. \nBackground: Mr. Olsen has a history of schizoaffective disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was recently started on haloperidol 5mg PO BID two weeks ago due to increasing psychotic symptoms. He also takes lisinopril 20mg daily and atorvastatin 40mg daily. \nAssessment: Mr. Olsen is exhibiting muscle rigidity, tremors, and a shuffling gait. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate is 110 bpm, and blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg. He is diaphoretic and less responsive than usual. Lab results show elevated creatinine kinase (CK) at 1500 U/L (normal range: 30-200 U/L). \nRecommendation: I am concerned about neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) given his symptoms and recent medication change. I recommend immediately discontinuing haloperidol, initiating cooling measures, administering IV fluids, and monitoring vital signs and lab values closely. Consider administering dantrolene or bromocriptine per physician order. STAT consult to neurology requested. \n15:00 SBAR. Patient had one dose of dantrolene. Temp now 38.3C. Still has muscle rigidity. Continues to get IV fluids."

    "correct": "r1: Typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are associated with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, elevated CK, and altered mental status. The SBAR, vital signs, lab results, and physical exam all point to NMS as the likely cause. r2: SSRIs can cause activation, leading to restlessness, agitation, and insomnia, particularly when initiating treatment. The question asks about the MOST likely class, and the other options are less directly associated with these specific symptoms. r3: MAOIs can cause orthostatic hypotension due to their effects on norepinephrine levels, leading to decreased blood pressure upon standing.",
    "incorrect": "r1: SSRIs are not typically associated with muscle rigidity and elevated CK, which are hallmark signs of NMS. MAOIs do not typically cause the constellation of symptoms seen in NMS. r2: Typical antipsychotics are more associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like dystonia and akathisia. MAOIs are not directly linked to causing restlessness or insomnia. r3: Typical antipsychotics are more associated with EPS such as akathisia (restlessness) rather than orthostatic hypotension as a primary side effect.
