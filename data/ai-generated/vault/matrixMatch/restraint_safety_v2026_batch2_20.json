Became increasingly agitated throughout the night, attempting to climb out of bed. \n07:15 B: History of Alzheimer's disease. No known allergies. Admitted from home; lives alone. Baseline mobility impaired; uses a walker. UTI confirmed via urinalysis. Currently on IV antibiotics.\n07:30 A: Patient is confused, disoriented to time and place. Restless, pulling at IV line. Attempted to remove urinary catheter. Vital signs stable (see vital signs tab). Physician notified of escalating agitation. Verbal de-escalation attempts unsuccessful. Exhibiting increased risk of falls and self-harm. \n07:45 R: Requesting orders for restraints (physical or chemical) to ensure patient safety and prevent dislodgement of medical devices. Orders for restraints should include specific type, duration, and monitoring parameters. Consider a low dose PRN antipsychotic if agitation continues despite physical restraint measures. Ensure continuous monitoring of patient's respiratory status and skin integrity if restraints are implemented."
