        "content": "07:00 SBAR for Ms. Eleanor Vance. Situation: 78-year-old female admitted with worsening heart failure, increased dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. Background: History of heart failure (HF) NYHA Class III, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Home medications include furosemide 40mg PO daily, lisinopril 20mg PO daily, and digoxin 0.125mg PO daily. Assessment: Noted increased shortness of breath, orthopnea, and dependent edema in lower extremities. Current weight is 85 kg, a 3 kg increase since the last clinic visit. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally in lower lung fields. Patient reports decreased urine output over the past 24 hours. Vital signs are elevated, with BP 160/90 mmHg and HR 105 bpm. Labs show elevated BNP and creatinine. Recommendation: Please evaluate for possible increase in diuretic dosage or other interventions to manage fluid overload. Monitor respiratory status and edema closely. Assess electrolyte levels due to diuretic use. Encourage fluid restriction and sodium-restricted diet. \n11:00 Noted patient is increasingly restless and anxious. Oxygen saturation fluctuating between 90-92% on 2L nasal cannula. Notified MD of change in condition. \n14:00 Patient received 20mg IV Furosemide per MD order. Monitoring urine output closely.\n18:00 Patient reports feeling slightly less short of breath. Urine output increased to 300 mL since last dose of furosemide. Continue to monitor."
