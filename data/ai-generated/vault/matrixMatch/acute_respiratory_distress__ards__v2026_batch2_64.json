He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.\n\nBackground: Patient has a history of hypertension and GERD. He presented with increased work of breathing, fever, and productive cough. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates. Initial ABG on room air: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58, HCO3 24.\n\nAssessment: Patient is sedated with propofol and fentanyl. Current vent settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O, TV 450 mL, RR 16. SpO2 is 90-92%. Peak inspiratory pressure is 35 cm H2O. ABG at 0530: pH 7.32, PaCO2 48, PaO2 65, HCO3 24. Coarse crackles auscultated bilaterally. Patient is on continuous enteral feeds at 40 mL/hr. Vasoactive agents are not prescribed at this time.\n\nRecommendation: Consider increasing PEEP to improve oxygenation and decrease FiO2. Prone positioning may be beneficial if oxygenation does not improve. Monitor for signs of barotrauma and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Continue sedation and analgesia as needed. Strict aspiration precautions in place. Oral care q2h. Turn q2h. Continue monitoring vital signs and respiratory status closely.\n\n0615: PEEP increased to 12 cm H2O per order. Will reassess ABGs in 1 hour.\n"
