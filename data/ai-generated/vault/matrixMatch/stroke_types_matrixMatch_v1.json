        "correct": "Differentiating stroke types is critical for determining the appropriate medical interventions. (r1) A sudden, severe 'thunderclap' headache is a hallmark symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage, often caused by a ruptured aneurysm. The rapid increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) from the bleeding causes intense pain. (r2) Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) increases the risk of clot formation in the heart, which can then travel to the brain and cause an ischemic stroke. Carotid stenosis narrows the carotid arteries, increasing the risk of thrombus formation and subsequent ischemic stroke. (r3) Ischemic strokes often present with focal neurological deficits due to the blockage of blood flow to a specific area of the brain. Specific vascular territories supply different areas of the brain, and damage to these areas results in predictable deficits (e.g., middle cerebral artery stroke often causes contralateral weakness and sensory loss). While hemorrhagic strokes can also cause focal deficits, they are more often associated with global symptoms like altered level of consciousness. (r4) Rapidly deteriorating level of consciousness and vomiting are indicative of increased ICP, which is more commonly associated with hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding causes swelling and pressure on the brainstem, leading to decreased consciousness and stimulation of the vomiting center. (r5) Alteplase is a thrombolytic medication used to dissolve blood clots in ischemic stroke. It must be administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to be effective and safe. It is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke because it would worsen the bleeding.",
