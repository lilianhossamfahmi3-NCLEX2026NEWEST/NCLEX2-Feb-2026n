Blood glucose today ranged 250-350 mg/dL. \n**Background:** Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 12. Usually well-controlled on insulin lispro and insulin glargine. Reports recent stress and dietary indiscretion leading to poor glycemic control. Previous hospitalizations for DKA. Allergies: NKDA.\n**Assessment:** Alert and oriented x3. Complains of fatigue and increased thirst. Vitals stable. Capillary blood glucose at 07:00: 310 mg/dL. Acetone negative. Physical exam reveals dry oral mucosa and slightly decreased skin turgor. Lungs clear. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Bowel sounds normoactive. Extremities without edema. Insulin lispro 10 units subcutaneously and insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously were administered at 07:15. \n**Recommendation:** Continue to monitor blood glucose q2h. Encourage oral fluids. Consult dietitian for diabetes education. Consider sliding scale insulin coverage if hyperglycemia persists. Anticipate further orders from the physician regarding insulin adjustments. Next blood glucose check due at 09:00. Patient denies chest pain or SOB. Patient verbalized understanding of plan of care. New IV 20 gauge in right forearm with NS infusing at 75 mL/hr. Urine clear and yellow. Documented and notified Dr. Smith of patient's status."
