No acute concerns today.\n\nBackground: Born full-term, uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Immunizations up-to-date. Breastfed until 6 months, now on purees and some finger foods. Has been meeting developmental milestones according to parent report at previous visits. No known allergies.\n\nAssessment: Alert and interactive infant. Weight and height within normal range for age (see vitals). Auscultation of heart and lungs clear. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Moves all extremities equally. Noted to transfer objects from one hand to another during assessment. Unable to sit unsupported for more than a few seconds. Does not crawl, scoots on bottom. Responds to own name. Babbles sounds like 'mama' and 'dada'.\n\nRecommendation: Continue current feeding plan. Encourage tummy time and floor play to promote crawling. Discuss anticipatory guidance regarding age-appropriate safety measures and developmental expectations. Schedule next well-child visit in 3 months. Address parental concerns and provide resources as needed."
