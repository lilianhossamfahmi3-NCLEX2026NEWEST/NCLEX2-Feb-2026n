He has been on oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula. His condition has worsened despite treatment.\nAssessment: He is now more confused and restless. His respiratory rate is 32 and labored. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds with wheezing bilaterally. SpO2 is 88% on 2L NC. Current vital signs indicate a decline from previous readings. ABG results are concerning. \nRecommendation: I recommend increasing his oxygen support, possibly to a non-rebreather mask. We should consider repeating the ABG in one hour to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Notify the provider immediately to evaluate the need for further intervention such as BiPAP or intubation if his respiratory status does not improve. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is crucial. Assess LOC frequently. 10:15 Notified Dr. Smith. Orders received and implemented. Oxygen increased to 10L via non-rebreather. - Nurse Jones"
