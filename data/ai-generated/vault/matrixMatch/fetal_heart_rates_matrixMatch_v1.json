    "correct": "FHR patterns reflect fetal oxygenation and stress. \n\n**(r1) Early Decelerations:** These are a physiological response to fetal head compression during contractions. The vagal nerve is stimulated, causing a transient decrease in heart rate. This is a benign finding and requires no intervention other than continued monitoring.\n\n**(r2) Late Decelerations:** These indicate uteroplacental insufficiency, meaning the placenta is not delivering enough oxygen to the fetus. This can be caused by maternal hypotension, uterine tachysystole (excessive contractions), or placental abruption. Interventions aim to improve placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation.  Stopping Oxytocin reduces uterine activity, allowing for better blood flow. An IV bolus increases maternal blood volume, improving placental perfusion. Placing the mother on her left side relieves pressure on the vena cava, further enhancing blood flow.\n\n**(r3) Variable Decelerations:** These are caused by umbilical cord compression, which reduces fetal oxygenation. The abrupt change in FHR reflects the sudden occlusion of the umbilical vessels. Changing the mother's position can relieve the pressure on the cord. \n\n**(r4) Accelerations:** These are a reassuring sign of fetal well-being, indicating an intact fetal central nervous system and adequate oxygen reserve. They are often associated with fetal movement. No intervention is required; document the finding.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers indicate a misunderstanding of the underlying causes and appropriate interventions for different FHR patterns. Early decelerations are not ominous and do not require intrauterine resuscitation. Late decelerations require immediate intervention to improve fetal oxygenation. Variable decelerations are caused by cord compression, not uteroplacental insufficiency.",

      "situation": "The patient is a 28-year-old G1P0 at 39 weeks gestation, admitted for induction of labor.",
      "background": "She has been on Oxytocin for 4 hours. Her baseline FHR was 130 bpm with moderate variability.",
      "assessment": "Currently, the FHR shows recurrent late decelerations to 100 bpm, occurring with each contraction. Contractions are every 2 minutes, lasting 90 seconds. Maternal blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend discontinuing Oxytocin, administering an IV fluid bolus of 500 mL Lactated Ringers, placing the patient in a left lateral position, and administering oxygen via face mask at 10 L/min.  I also recommend notifying the provider immediately and preparing for potential expedited delivery if the decelerations persist.  Please advise on further management. Time: 1430."
