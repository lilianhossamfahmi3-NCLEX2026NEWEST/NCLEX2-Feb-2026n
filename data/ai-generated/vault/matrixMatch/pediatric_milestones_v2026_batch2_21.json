Parents express concern about developmental delays.\n*   Infant C: Born full-term, family history of developmental delays, parents actively engaged in early intervention programs.\n\nAssessment:\n*   Infant A: Demonstrates ability to sit unsupported for a short period, transfers objects between hands, babbles 'mama' and 'dada'.\n*   Infant B: Rolls from back to side, grasps objects with palmar grasp, responds to own name inconsistently.\n*   Infant C: Pulls to stand with support, feeds self with fingers, imitates simple gestures like clapping.\n\nRecommendation:\n*   Continue to monitor all infants' developmental progress.\n*   Provide anticipatory guidance to parents regarding age-appropriate activities and potential developmental red flags.\n*   Refer Infant B for further developmental evaluation due to prematurity and parental concerns.\n*   Schedule follow-up appointments in 3 months to reassess milestones.\n\n**08:15**\nDr. evaluation complete. Orders entered. Schedule follow up."
