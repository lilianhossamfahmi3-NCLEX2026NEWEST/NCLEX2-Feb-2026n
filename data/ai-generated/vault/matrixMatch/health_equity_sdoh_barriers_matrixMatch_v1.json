    "correct": "SDOH categories often overlap.\n\n**(r1) Food deserts & Access/Economic Stability:** Food deserts, characterized by limited access to affordable and nutritious food, are often a consequence of socioeconomic factors like poverty and lack of transportation. This directly impacts access to healthy food options, leading to poor dietary habits and increased risk of chronic diseases. The lack of grocery stores within a reasonable distance creates a significant barrier to obtaining essential nutrients.\n\n**(r2) Language Barriers & Health Literacy:** Language discordance between healthcare providers and patients significantly impairs effective communication. This can lead to misunderstandings of medical instructions, medication regimens, and health education materials. Reduced comprehension hinders the patient's ability to actively participate in their care, ultimately diminishing health literacy and potentially leading to adverse health outcomes.\n\n**(r3) Insulin Costs & Access/Economic Stability:** The inability to afford insulin co-pays represents a significant economic barrier to accessing essential medication. Insulin is a life-sustaining medication for individuals with diabetes, and unaffordability can lead to poor glycemic control, increased risk of complications (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, neuropathy, retinopathy), and even death. This highlights the critical interplay between economic stability and access to healthcare.\n\n**(r4) Digital Divide & Access to Care:** The lack of high-speed internet access in areas where specialty care is primarily delivered via telehealth creates a 'digital divide' that disproportionately affects individuals in rural or underserved communities. Telehealth offers the potential to improve access to specialized medical expertise, but this benefit is negated when individuals lack the necessary technology infrastructure to participate. This exacerbates existing health disparities and limits access to timely and appropriate care.",

This may include connecting clients with resources such as food banks, language interpreters, financial assistance programs, and internet access initiatives. Addressing these barriers is crucial for improving health equity and promoting positive health outcomes."
