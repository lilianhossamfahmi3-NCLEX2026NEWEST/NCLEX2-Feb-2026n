Saturation dropping.\n**Background:** Admitted for pneumonia, progressed to ARDS. Initial improvement with PEEP and prone positioning. Now showing signs of refractory hypoxemia. Cultures pending.\n**Assessment:** Vitals: HR 120, RR 32 (vented), BP 90/60, SpO2 88% on FiO2 70%, PEEP 12. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55, PaO2 58. Increased work of breathing noted. Chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates. Patient is restless and appears uncomfortable. Increased secretions noted. Suctioned copious amounts of thick, tan secretions. Lung compliance is decreasing. \n**Recommendation:** Recommend reassessment of ventilator settings and consideration of further interventions such as increasing PEEP or alternative ventilation strategies. Possible consideration of neuromuscular blockade. Request orders for repeat ABG and chest X-ray. Evaluate for possible infection and need for bronchodilators. Consult pulmonology."

        "rationale": "PEEP increases alveolar recruitment, preventing alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. This increases the surface area available for gas exchange, thus improving oxygenation. PEEP also helps to reduce intrapulmonary shunting, where blood passes through the lungs without participating in gas exchange."

        "rationale": "In ARDS, the lungs are susceptible to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). High tidal volumes can cause overdistension of already injured alveoli, leading to further damage. Decreasing tidal volume to a lung-protective ventilation strategy (typically 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) minimizes this risk, reducing the strain on the lungs and preventing barotrauma and volutrauma."

        "rationale": "Prone positioning redistributes lung perfusion and ventilation, particularly in the dorsal regions of the lungs which are often collapsed or fluid-filled in ARDS. This promotes more uniform gas exchange, reduces shunting, and ultimately improves oxygenation. It also helps to drain secretions and alleviate pressure on the heart and mediastinum."

        "rationale": "In ARDS, increasing the I:E ratio (e.g., from 1:2 to 1:1 or even inverse ratios) can improve ventilation by allowing more time for gas exchange. This is particularly useful in patients with severe air trapping or those who require higher levels of PEEP. By prolonging the inspiratory phase, it enhances alveolar recruitment and reduces the risk of alveolar collapse, leading to improved CO2 removal and overall ventilation."
