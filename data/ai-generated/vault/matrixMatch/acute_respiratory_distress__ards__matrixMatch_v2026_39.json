Continue to monitor and assess for complications. \n\n**09:30** Patient stable in prone position. Skin integrity assessed and maintained. Communication with family regarding plan of care. \n\n**10:00** ABG results pending. Further adjustments to ventilator settings may be required based on results. Continuous monitoring and assessment ongoing.\n\n**10:30** ABG results received. PaO2 improving but still below target range. Recommendation to maintain current settings and reassess in 2 hours.\n\n**11:00** Patient tolerating prone positioning well. No signs of skin breakdown or pressure ulcers noted. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation.\n\n**11:30** Slight decrease in oxygen saturation noted. Assessing for potential causes, including mucus plugging or equipment malfunction.\n\n**12:00** Suctioning performed, small amount of thick secretions removed.

Prone positioning improves oxygenation by reducing ventilation-perfusion mismatch and decreasing intrapulmonary shunting. The dependent lung regions become better ventilated, and perfusion is more evenly distributed. Maintaining FiO2 at 60% directly contributes to improving oxygenation by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired gas.",
