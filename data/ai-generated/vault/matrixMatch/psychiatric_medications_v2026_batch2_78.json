        "content": "**SBAR Communication**\n\n**Situation:** John Smith, a 68-year-old male with a history of depression and psychosis, admitted 3 days ago for increased agitation and disorganized thoughts. He has been on several psychiatric medications over the past year.\n\n**Background:** The patient has a history of non-adherence to medications. He was previously treated with sertraline, risperidone, and isocarboxazid (discontinued 2 weeks prior to admission). Currently prescribed: sertraline 100mg PO daily and haloperidol 5mg IM PRN for agitation.\n\n**Assessment:**\n07:00: Patient found pacing in room, exhibiting muscle rigidity and tremors. Temperature 103.2°F (39.6°C), HR 112 bpm, BP 160/90 mmHg, RR 24 breaths/min. Noted diaphoresis and altered mental status. Patient reports increased anxiety and restlessness. Cogwheeling present in upper extremities. Bowel sounds hyperactive. Recent medication review shows haloperidol administered at 02:00 for acute agitation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nSTAT labs ordered (CBC, CMP, CK, urine drug screen). Hold scheduled sertraline dose. Initiate cooling measures for hyperthermia. Assess for medication interactions and potential serotonin syndrome vs. neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Monitor vital signs closely and provide supportive care. Contact provider with lab results and continued elevated temperature. Possible need for dantrolene or bromocriptine pending diagnosis."

    "correct": "Typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, can cause Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterized by muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. SSRIs can cause serotonin syndrome, marked by altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities. \n\nNMS is caused by dopamine blockade, leading to rigidity and hyperthermia. Serotonin syndrome occurs due to excessive serotonin levels in the central nervous system, resulting in a range of symptoms from mild to severe.",
    "incorrect": "SSRIs are less likely to directly cause muscle rigidity and hyperthermia without other signs of serotonin syndrome. MAOIs, while capable of causing hypertensive crisis with certain drug or food interactions, are less directly associated with the specific presentation of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia. Typical antipsychotics are less associated with isolated anxiety and hyperactive bowel sounds, which are more characteristic of serotonin syndrome. MAOIs do not directly cause the specific combination of diaphoresis, tachycardia, and altered mental status without dietary or drug interactions.",
