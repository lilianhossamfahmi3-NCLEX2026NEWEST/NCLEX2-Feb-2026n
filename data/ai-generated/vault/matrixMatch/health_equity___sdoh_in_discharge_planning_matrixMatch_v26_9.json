      "correct": "Addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) is crucial for ensuring equitable health outcomes post-discharge. Lack of transportation hinders access to follow-up appointments and medications, making transportation assistance essential. Food insecurity compromises nutritional status and overall health, necessitating referrals to food banks and nutrition programs. Housing instability disrupts medication adherence and increases exposure to environmental hazards; therefore, linking patients to housing assistance programs is vital. Limited health literacy impairs the patient's ability to understand and follow discharge instructions, requiring simplified materials and visual aids to promote self-management.",
