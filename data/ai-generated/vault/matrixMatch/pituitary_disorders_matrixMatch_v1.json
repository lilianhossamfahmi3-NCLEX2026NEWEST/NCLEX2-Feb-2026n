    "correct": "ADH, or vasopressin, is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. It regulates fluid balance by controlling the reabsorption of water in the kidneys. \n\n*   **SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone):** Characterized by excessive ADH release, leading to increased water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in fluid overload, dilutional hyponatremia, and concentrated urine. (r1) Hyponatremia occurs because the excess water dilutes the serum sodium concentration. (r2) The kidneys retain water, leading to a high urine specific gravity. (r5) Fluid restriction is a key intervention to reduce fluid overload and prevent further sodium dilution.\n\n*   **Diabetes Insipidus (DI):** Characterized by insufficient ADH production or action, leading to decreased water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in excessive urination (polyuria), dehydration, and dilute urine. (r3) The kidneys are unable to concentrate urine, resulting in a low urine specific gravity. (r4) Polyuria (e.g., 400 mL/hr) and profound thirst are hallmark symptoms as the body attempts to compensate for fluid loss.",
    "incorrect": "Diabetes Insipidus is NOT related to blood glucose levels; it is a water-regulation problem. The primary issue in DI is a deficiency in ADH, leading to excessive water loss, not glucose dysregulation.",
