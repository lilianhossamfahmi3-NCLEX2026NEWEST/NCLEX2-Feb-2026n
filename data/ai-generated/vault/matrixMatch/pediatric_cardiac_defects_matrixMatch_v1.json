    "correct": "Defects are categorized by their effect on oxygenation. \n\n**(r1 & r3) ASD, VSD, and PDA: Acyanotic (Increased Pulmonary Blood Flow)**\n*   These defects involve a left-to-right shunt. Oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart flows into the right side, increasing pulmonary blood flow. This does not initially cause cyanosis because oxygenated blood is still reaching the systemic circulation. Over time, increased pulmonary blood flow can lead to pulmonary hypertension and eventual reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome).\n\n**(r2 & r4) Tetralogy of Fallot and Transposition of the Great Arteries: Cyanotic (Decreased Pulmonary Blood Flow/Mixing)**\n*   **Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF):** This involves four defects: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, overriding aorta, and ventricular septal defect. Pulmonary stenosis obstructs blood flow to the lungs, and the VSD allows deoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood, entering the systemic circulation. The overriding aorta receives blood from both ventricles, further contributing to cyanosis.\n*   **Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA):** The aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This creates two separate circulations: deoxygenated blood circulates through the body, and oxygenated blood circulates through the lungs. Without a mixing point (e.g., PDA, VSD), this is incompatible with life.",
    "incorrect": "Coarctation of the Aorta is also acyanotic but involves obstruction of flow rather than a shunt. Coarctation causes increased blood pressure proximal to the coarctation and decreased blood pressure distal to the coarctation. This can lead to heart failure and other complications.",

      "Infants with Tetralogy of Fallot may experience 'Tet spells' during crying or feeding, which are managed by placing the child in a knee-chest position to increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right-to-left shunting. Administering oxygen and morphine can also help.",
      "Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is often administered to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in infants with cyanotic heart defects like TGA or severe pulmonary stenosis. This allows for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, improving oxygenation until surgical intervention."
