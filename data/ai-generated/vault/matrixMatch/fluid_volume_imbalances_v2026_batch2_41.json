Suspect fluid volume overload related to heart failure exacerbation. B. Mr. Johnson, 78 y/o male, admitted 3 days ago for CHF. C. Patient reports increased dyspnea and swelling in ankles and feet. Physical exam reveals bilateral crackles in lower lobes, 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities, and distended jugular veins. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 160/90, RR 28, SpO2 90% on room air. Weight increased 5 lbs since admission. D. Continue current orders for furosemide 40mg IV BID and monitor fluid balance. Please assess patient's respiratory status and edema. Consider increasing diuretic dose if symptoms worsen. Evaluate serum electrolytes, especially potassium, due to diuretic use. Notify provider of any significant changes."

Edema is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, forcing fluid into the interstitial spaces. Decreased potassium results from fluid overload diluting serum potassium levels. Elevated BUN may result from kidneys working harder to filter excess fluid.",

Clinical findings such as poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, hypotension, tachycardia, and concentrated urine are classic signs of FVD.

Elevated BUN, while sometimes seen in FVE due to impaired renal function, can also suggest dehydration in the context of FVD if the creatinine level is also elevated.",
