    "correct": "Ventilator alarms signal deviations from pre-set parameters, indicating changes in airway resistance, lung compliance, or delivered volume. \n\n**(r1 & r3) High-Pressure Alarms:** These alarms trigger when the ventilator encounters increased resistance to delivering a breath. This resistance can stem from various factors:\n*   **Biting the ETT/Excessive Secretions:** Obstruction of the airway increases resistance.\n*   **Tension Pneumothorax:** Air accumulation in the pleural space compresses the lung, increasing resistance to inflation. The positive pressure ventilation exacerbates this, leading to a rapid increase in intrathoracic pressure, compromising venous return and cardiac output. This is a life-threatening emergency.\n\n**(r2 & r4) Low-Pressure Alarms:** These alarms indicate a loss of pressure or volume within the ventilator circuit.\n*   **Ventilator Disconnection:** A break in the circuit allows air to escape, reducing pressure and delivered volume.\n*   **Endotracheal Tube Cuff Leak:** A leak in the cuff prevents adequate seal, causing air to escape around the ETT and reducing delivered tidal volume. This can lead to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation.\n\n**Pathophysiology Deep Dive:**\n*   **High-Pressure Alarms:** Increased airway resistance or decreased lung compliance forces the ventilator to work harder to deliver the set tidal volume. This increased pressure can lead to barotrauma (lung injury from excessive pressure) if not addressed promptly.\n*   **Low-Pressure Alarms:** Loss of pressure or volume results in inadequate alveolar ventilation, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The body's compensatory mechanisms may be overwhelmed, resulting in respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.",
    "incorrect": "A pneumothorax increases intrathoracic pressure, essentially 'squeezing' the lungs from the outside, which leads to a high-pressure (not low) alarm. Low-pressure alarms indicate a leak or disconnection in the system.",

      "If the nurse cannot immediately identify the cause of a ventilator alarm and the patient is in distress (e.g., desaturation, increased work of breathing), the priority is to disconnect the ventilator from the patient's airway and manually ventilate with a bag-valve-mask (Ambu bag) connected to supplemental oxygen. Call for assistance immediately.",
