        "content": "07:00 SBAR for Ms. Eleanor Vance, DOB 03/15/1958. \n\nSituation: Ms. Vance is a 68-year-old female admitted for major depressive disorder and anxiety. She was started on several medications two weeks ago. \n\nBackground: Ms. Vance has a history of depression and anxiety, previously managed with therapy. Recent life stressors have exacerbated her symptoms. New medication regimen includes sertraline 100mg PO daily, olanzapine 5mg PO BID, and lorazepam 1mg PO PRN anxiety. \n\nAssessment: Ms. Vance reports increased anxiety and restlessness. Noted muscle rigidity and tremors during assessment. Temperature 38.9°C (102°F), HR 115 bpm, BP 160/95 mmHg. Lab results show elevated creatine kinase (CK) at 800 U/L (reference range: 30-200 U/L). She also reports insomnia and difficulty concentrating. \n\nRecommendation: Notify provider immediately regarding possible adverse drug reactions. Hold olanzapine and lorazepam pending further evaluation. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status. Provide supportive care and ensure patient safety. Possible need for medication adjustment or additional interventions to manage potential serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Assess for EPS. Encourage hydration."

    "correct": "NMS is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, elevated CK levels, and autonomic dysfunction, often associated with antipsychotic medications. Serotonin syndrome is associated with anxiety, restlessness and insomnia while taking SSRIs. EPS are characterized by tremors and muscle rigidity shortly after starting antipsychotics.",
    "incorrect": "Serotonin Syndrome: While restlessness and anxiety can occur with antipsychotics, the presence of muscle rigidity and elevated CK points more strongly towards NMS. EPS: While tremors and rigidity are present, the elevated temperature and CK levels are more indicative of NMS. NMS: While muscle rigidity and tremors can be seen in EPS, the elevated temperature and CK levels are not typical. Serotonin Syndrome: Muscle rigidity and elevated CK are not primary features of serotonin syndrome. EPS: Restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia are not typical features of EPS. NMS: Restlessness, increased anxiety, and insomnia are not directly associated with NMS. Serotonin Syndrome is more likely with SSRIs.",
