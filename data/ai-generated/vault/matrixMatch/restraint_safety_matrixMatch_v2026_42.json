Attempted to redirect patient to chair and offered a snack, with no success. Continues pacing and verbalizing intent to leave.\n**07:30** Patient attempted to climb over the bedrail. Assisted back to bed. Restraints discussed with patient and the potential need for them explained. Patient became more agitated, yelling, \"Get away from me!\"\n**07:45** Secured soft wrist restraints to bed frame per hospital protocol and physician order. Continues to shout and struggle against restraints. Neurovascular checks performed and documented.\n**08:00** Physician notified of patient's continued agitation despite physical restraints. New order received for haloperidol 5mg IM.\n**08:15** Haloperidol 5mg IM administered to left vastus lateralis. Patient continues to verbally agitated but physical movements lessened. \n**08:30** Patient calmer, though still verbally resistant. Neurovascular checks to bilateral wrists remain within normal limits. Patient is now oriented to person, place, and time, but not situation. \n**09:00** Patient sleeping quietly.

        "rationale": "Correct: Physical restraints are appropriate when a patient's behavior poses an immediate risk of harm to themselves. The patient attempting to climb over the bedrail demonstrates a risk of injury, justifying the use of physical restraints after less restrictive measures have failed. Hospitals have specific policies and procedures that guide the appropriate use of restraints, including assessment, documentation, and ongoing monitoring."

        "rationale": "Correct: Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is a chemical restraint used to manage acute agitation. Offering it orally is a less invasive method than IM administration and aligns with the principle of using the least restrictive intervention first. A PRN order allows for administration based on the patient's needs and assessment."

The IM route provides a faster onset of action. This requires careful consideration of potential side effects and monitoring."

Whenever possible, inform the patient that restraints might be needed before their behavior escalates.
