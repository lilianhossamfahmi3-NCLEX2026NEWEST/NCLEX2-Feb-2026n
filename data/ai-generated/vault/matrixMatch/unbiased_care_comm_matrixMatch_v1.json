    "correct": "Biased language in clinical hand-offs negatively impacts patient safety and contributes to health disparities. (r1) Terms like 'frequent flier' and 'drug-seeking' are stigmatizing, clinically imprecise, and can lead to diagnostic overshadowing. This occurs when a patient's symptoms are attributed to their perceived character flaws rather than a thorough medical evaluation. (r2) Correct use of pronouns and gender identity is inclusive, respects patient autonomy, and is a legal standard in healthcare. Misgendering can cause significant psychological distress and erode trust. (r3) Stereotyping a client as 'culturally resistant' is a sign of implicit bias and ignores the complex social, economic, and historical factors that influence health behaviors. It prevents culturally competent care. (r4) Using medical terminology ('SUD') rather than stigmatizing labels ('addict') is professional, objective, and reduces bias. SUD is a recognized medical condition with specific diagnostic criteria.",
