        "correct": "The ROME method is used to interpret ABGs. (r1) pH 7.31 (↓), PaCO2 52 mmHg (↑), HCO3 25 mEq/L (Normal): Respiratory Acidosis. The elevated PaCO2 indicates hypoventilation, causing CO2 retention. The lungs fail to eliminate CO2 effectively, leading to a decrease in pH. This can occur in conditions like COPD, pneumonia, or opioid overdose. (r2) pH 7.50 (↑), PaCO2 30 mmHg (↓), HCO3 22 mEq/L (Normal): Respiratory Alkalosis. The decreased PaCO2 indicates hyperventilation, causing excessive CO2 excretion. This leads to an increase in pH. Common causes include anxiety, pain, or pulmonary embolism. (r3) pH 7.28 (↓), PaCO2 38 mmHg (Normal), HCO3 16 mEq/L (↓): Metabolic Acidosis. The decreased HCO3 indicates a loss of bicarbonate or an accumulation of acid. The kidneys are unable to maintain adequate bicarbonate levels. This can occur in conditions like DKA, renal failure, or severe diarrhea. (r4) pH 7.48 (↑), PaCO2 42 mmHg (Normal), HCO3 34 mEq/L (↑): Metabolic Alkalosis. The elevated HCO3 indicates an excess of bicarbonate or a loss of acid. The kidneys retain too much bicarbonate or there is excessive loss of acid from the body. This can occur in conditions like prolonged vomiting, NG suctioning, or excessive antacid use.",
