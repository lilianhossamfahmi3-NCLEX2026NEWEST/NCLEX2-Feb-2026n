States, \"I can't catch my breath, and my ankles are so swollen!\" Weight increased by 5 lbs since last week per patient report.\n0715 B: PMH: Heart failure (Stage III), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (Stage 2). Meds: Furosemide 40mg PO BID, Lisinopril 10mg PO daily, Metoprolol 25mg PO BID. Last dose of furosemide given at 20:00 yesterday. Alert and oriented x3. \n0730 A: Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in lower lobes. 3+ pitting edema noted in bilateral lower extremities. Bounding pulses. JVD present. Urine output decreased since admission. Labs pending. Currently on 2L NC with SpO2 92%. \n0745 R: Anticipate orders for increased diuretic dose, fluid restriction, and possible sodium restriction. Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and urine output closely. Will update provider with lab results as soon as available."

Clinical findings include bounding pulses, crackles in the lungs, elevated BUN and creatinine levels (due to dilutional effect or kidney compromise), and jugular vein distension (JVD). Fluid volume deficit (hypovolemia) occurs when there is a loss of fluid from the body, which may manifest as flat neck veins and skin tenting.",

Bounding pulses, crackles, and elevated BUN/Creatinine are associated with fluid volume excess, not deficit. Elevated BUN and Creatinine can indicate either fluid volume excess OR fluid volume deficit depending on the kidney's underlying ability to compensate; in this scenario the BUN and Creatinine are elevated due to kidney compromise in the setting of fluid volume excess.",
