States \"They are coming to get me!\" \n**07:15** B: History of chronic alcohol abuse, hypertension, and anxiety. Last alcohol intake reported yesterday morning. CIWA score at 06:00 was 15, indicating moderate withdrawal. Lorazepam 2mg PO given at 06:15. \n**07:30** A: Patient increasingly agitated, pacing in room, yelling obscenities. Attempted to strike nurse during medication administration. CIWA score increased to 20. Vital signs trending upwards (see vital signs tab). Redirected multiple times without success. Attempted verbal de-escalation without effect. \n**07:45** R: Requesting order for restraints due to patient's escalating aggression and risk of harm to self and staff. Will continue to monitor vital signs and CIWA score every 15 minutes. Notified provider of patient's status and escalating agitation. Need order for either physical or chemical restraints to ensure safety. Patient now attempting to climb over the bedrails. Provider considering haloperidol vs. physical restraints. Spoke with charge nurse about the situation and need for intervention. Considering initiating code grey if behavior escalates further. Continuous monitoring in place."
