States, 'Get away from me, you're trying to poison me!'\n**07:15** B: History of hypertension and mild cognitive impairment. Urosepsis confirmed via urine culture. Currently on IV antibiotics (Ceftriaxone). Alert and oriented to self only. No known allergies.\n**07:30** A: Patient is increasingly agitated, pulling at IV line, and attempting to remove catheter. Verbal de-escalation ineffective. Vital signs stable but elevated (HR 110, BP 160/90). Risk for falls and injury to self. MD notified.\n**07:45** R: Recommend restraint orders for patient safety. Reassess q15min, offer fluids, and continue monitoring vital signs. Consider haloperidol if agitation persists despite physical restraints. Dr. Chen aware. - Nurse Jones, RN"
