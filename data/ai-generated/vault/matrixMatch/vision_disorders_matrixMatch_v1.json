    "correct": "Vision disorders manifest with distinct patterns of visual impairment.\n\n*   **(r1) Cataracts:** The lens becomes progressively opaque, leading to blurry or cloudy vision, increased glare sensitivity, and difficulty distinguishing colors. This occurs due to the denaturation and aggregation of lens proteins, scattering light and reducing visual acuity.\n\n*   **(r2) Glaucoma:** Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) damages the optic nerve, initially affecting peripheral vision. This progressive loss of peripheral vision results in 'tunnel vision'. The pathophysiology involves impaired drainage of aqueous humor, leading to increased IOP and subsequent optic nerve damage.\n\n*   **(r3) Macular Degeneration:** Damage to the macula, the central part of the retina, causes a loss of central vision. Clients may report a 'blind spot' or distortion in the center of their visual field. This is often due to drusen formation (dry AMD) or neovascularization (wet AMD) in the macula.\n\n*   **(r4) Retinal Detachment:** Separation of the retina from the underlying choroid results in sudden visual disturbances. Clients may experience flashes of light (photopsia), floaters, and a sensation of a 'curtain' or shadow closing over their field of vision. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent permanent vision loss.",

    "deepPathophysiology": {
      "cataracts": "Cataracts are primarily caused by age-related changes in the lens proteins, leading to their denaturation and aggregation. This process results in increased light scattering and reduced transparency of the lens. Other risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, diabetes, smoking, and certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids).",
      "glaucoma": "Glaucoma is characterized by progressive optic neuropathy, often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The increased IOP damages the retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to characteristic patterns of visual field loss. Open-angle glaucoma, the most common type, results from impaired drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. Angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the iris blocks the drainage angle, causing a sudden increase in IOP.",
      "macularDegeneration": "Macular degeneration is a progressive disease affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. Dry AMD is characterized by the accumulation of drusen (yellow deposits) beneath the retina, leading to gradual vision loss. Wet AMD involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) beneath the retina, which can leak fluid and blood, causing rapid and severe vision loss.",
      "retinalDetachment": "Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the underlying choroid, disrupting its blood supply and leading to visual disturbances. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type and results from a tear or break in the retina, allowing fluid to accumulate beneath it. Tractional retinal detachment is caused by scar tissue or adhesions pulling on the retina. Exudative retinal detachment results from fluid accumulation beneath the retina without a tear or break."
