    "correct": "Meningeal irritation, often due to infection or inflammation, leads to protective muscle guarding and specific neurological signs. \n\n**(r1) Nuchal rigidity:** Severe neck stiffness results from inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The body attempts to limit movement to minimize pain. The inability to flex the chin to the chest is a hallmark sign.\n\n**(r2) Kernig's sign:** When the hip is flexed to 90 degrees and the knee is extended, pain and resistance indicate meningeal irritation. Stretching the inflamed meninges triggers pain in the lower back and hamstring muscles.\n\n**(r3) Brudzinski's sign:** Involuntary flexion of the hips and knees when the neck is flexed is another sign of meningeal irritation. The meninges are inflamed, and neck flexion causes a reflexive contraction of the hip and knee flexor muscles to reduce meningeal stretching.\n\n**(r4) Opisthotonos:** This severe hyperextension of the head, neck, and spine is a late and ominous sign of severe meningeal irritation or tetanus. It indicates significant neurological damage and uncontrolled muscle spasms.",
