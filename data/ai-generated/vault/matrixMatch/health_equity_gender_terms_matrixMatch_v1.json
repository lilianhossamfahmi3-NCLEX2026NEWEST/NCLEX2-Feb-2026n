For example, a person assigned female at birth identifies as a woman.\n\n*   **(r2) Nonbinary = Identity outside the male/female binary:** Nonbinary individuals do not identify exclusively as male or female. Their gender identity may fall somewhere in between, encompass both, or be entirely different. Many use 'they/them' pronouns.\n\n*   **(r3) Transgender = Identity that differs from birth sex:** A transgender person's gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a person assigned male at birth identifies as a woman.\n\n*   **(r4) Gender identity is the internal perception of self:** Gender identity is a person's internal sense of being male, female, both, neither, or another gender. It is distinct from sexual orientation and assigned sex at birth.",
