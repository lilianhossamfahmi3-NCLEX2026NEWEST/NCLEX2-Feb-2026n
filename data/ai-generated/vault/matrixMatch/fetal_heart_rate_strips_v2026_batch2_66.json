Baseline FHR is 135 bpm with moderate variability. \n\n1415: Cervical exam reveals 4 cm dilation, 70% effacement, and -2 station. \n\n1430: Noted FHR decelerations that mirror contractions, with onset and recovery coinciding with the start and end of the contractions. \n\n1445: Repositioned patient to left lateral position. \n\n1500: Continued monitoring reveals FHR decelerations that are abrupt and variable in timing, not consistently related to contractions. Some decelerations drop to 90 bpm for 30 seconds.\n\n1515: Noted several late decelerations, with the deceleration onset occurring after the peak of the contraction. Lowest point reaching 110 bpm. \n\n1530: Notified Dr. Smith about the late decelerations. Oxygen via face mask at 10 L/min initiated. \n\n1545: Dr. Smith at bedside. Orders received (see orders tab).\n\n1600: Amnioinfusion initiated per order. Continuous monitoring continues.\n\n1615: Variable decelerations noted to be improving, but late decelerations persist. \n\n1630: Dr. Smith considering delivery options based on fetal response to interventions."
