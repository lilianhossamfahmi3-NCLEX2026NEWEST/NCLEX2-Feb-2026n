        "correct": "In CKD, the kidneys' ability to excrete phosphorus is impaired, leading to hyperphosphatemia. This excess phosphorus binds to calcium, reducing serum calcium levels, resulting in hypocalcemia. (r1 & r2) The inverse relationship between calcium and phosphorus is crucial in CKD management. Both imbalances necessitate dietary monitoring to control phosphorus intake and supplement calcium as needed. (r3) Hypocalcemia increases neuronal excitability, causing spontaneous muscle contractions, manifesting as positive Trousseau's (carpopedal spasm with BP cuff inflation) and Chvostek's (facial muscle twitching upon tapping the facial nerve) signs. (r4) Sevelamer, a phosphate binder, is prescribed to bind dietary phosphorus in the GI tract, preventing its absorption and lowering serum phosphorus levels. This, in turn, helps to increase calcium levels. Phosphate binders are administered with meals to maximize their effectiveness in binding dietary phosphorus.",

Monitor calcium and phosphorus levels daily at 0800 and 2000. Administer calcium supplements as prescribed. Assess for signs of worsening hypocalcemia. Consult nephrologist for further management."
