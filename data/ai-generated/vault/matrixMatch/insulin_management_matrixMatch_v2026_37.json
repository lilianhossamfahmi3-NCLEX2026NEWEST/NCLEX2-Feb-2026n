Currently, patient is alert and oriented, but reports feeling weak and nauseous. Blood glucose elevated.\nBackground: Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes for 15 years. Usually well-controlled with insulin pump, but pump malfunctioned 2 days ago and patient did not administer insulin via alternative subcutaneous injection method. Admitted yesterday at 18:00 with initial blood glucose of 450 mg/dL. DKA protocol initiated.\nAssessment: Current vital signs: HR 110, BP 110/70, RR 24 and deep, Temp 99.8°F (37.7°C), SpO2 96% on room air. Blood glucose currently 280 mg/dL. Urine ketones large. Patient receiving intravenous fluids and insulin infusion per DKA protocol.\nRecommendation: Continue to monitor blood glucose every hour and adjust insulin infusion rate as needed. Monitor electrolytes, especially potassium. Provide patient education on alternative subcutaneous insulin administration in case of future pump malfunction. Ensure patient eats regularly once tolerating oral intake. Consult diabetes educator prior to discharge. 07:30 Notified MD of patient status. Orders received to decrease insulin infusion per protocol, continue monitoring vitals and labs. Will check patient's blood glucose in one hour. -- Nurse Jane Doe, RN"
