    "correct": "Potassium (K+) is the major intracellular cation, playing a crucial role in nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and cellular metabolism. Normal serum K+ range is 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. Imbalances can significantly impact cardiac and neuromuscular function.\n\n*   **(r1) Muscle weakness or cramping:** Hypokalemia reduces the resting membrane potential, making it harder for muscles to depolarize and contract, leading to weakness and cramps. Hyperkalemia can initially cause muscle twitching, but prolonged elevation leads to weakness due to persistent depolarization.\n\n*   **(r2) Peaked T-waves and widened QRS complex on ECG:** Hyperkalemia affects cardiac repolarization. Elevated extracellular K+ reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to faster repolarization and peaked T-waves. As hyperkalemia worsens, it slows conduction through the heart, widening the QRS complex, potentially leading to arrhythmias.\n\n*   **(r3) Prominent U-waves and ST-segment depression on ECG:** Hypokalemia prolongs repolarization of the ventricles, sometimes resulting in a U-wave after the T-wave. ST-segment depression also reflects altered ventricular repolarization due to decreased extracellular K+.\n\n*   **(r4) Decreased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) and constipation:** Hypokalemia reduces the excitability of nerve and muscle cells. This decreased excitability leads to reduced DTRs. Hypokalemia also slows smooth muscle contraction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to decreased peristalsis and constipation.",
    "incorrect": "Review the ECG changes and neuromuscular manifestations associated with hyperkalemia and hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia typically presents with peaked T-waves, while hypokalemia is associated with U-waves and ST-segment depression. Hyperkalemia can cause muscle twitching initially, but hypokalemia is more commonly associated with muscle weakness and cramping.",

      "Always assess renal function before administering potassium supplements, as the kidneys are primarily responsible for potassium excretion. Monitor ECG continuously during IV potassium administration. Never administer undiluted IV potassium; it can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Assess for digitalis toxicity in patients with hypokalemia, as low potassium levels increase the risk of digitalis-induced arrhythmias.",
