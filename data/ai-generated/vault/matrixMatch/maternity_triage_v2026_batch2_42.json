Need to prioritize based on reported symptoms.\nBackground: All clients are in their second or third trimester. Relevant history obtained during initial intake.\nAssessment:\n-Client 1: Reports occasional heartburn, relieved by antacids. Denies bleeding, contractions, or visual changes.\n-Client 2: Complains of severe, persistent headache and blurred vision. BP 160/100 mmHg.\n-Client 3: States she's noticed increased fetal movement, especially after drinking juice. Denies contractions or bleeding.\n-Client 4: Reports painless vaginal bleeding, saturating one pad per hour. Fetal movement not felt this morning.\nRecommendation: Immediate physician evaluation for Clients 2 and 4. Further assessment for Clients 1 and 3 as time permits."
