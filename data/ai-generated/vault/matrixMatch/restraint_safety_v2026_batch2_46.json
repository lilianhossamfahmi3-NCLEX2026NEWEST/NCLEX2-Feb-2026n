Restless night, frequently calling out. **11:00** B: PMH includes anxiety and a previous episode of alcohol withdrawal. Currently on IV antibiotics and oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. **15:00** A: Patient increasingly agitated; pulled out IV line. Attempted to climb out of bed. Redness noted at previous IV site. Vital signs stable but elevated (HR 110, BP 150/90). MD notified. Family at bedside is anxious. **15:30** R: MD order received for haloperidol 5mg IM PRN agitation and physical restraints if necessary. Continue to monitor vital signs q15 minutes after medication administration, assess IV site, and provide emotional support to patient and family. Ensure restraint protocol is followed meticulously. Discuss de-escalation techniques with the team."

    "correct": "Physical restraints involve the use of devices to limit a patient's movement, requiring continuous monitoring of respiratory status, offering fluids, and frequent documentation. Chemical restraints use medication to control behavior, requiring monitoring of the medication's effects. Restraints should be used as a last resort, with the least restrictive method employed first. Continuous monitoring and documentation are crucial for both types of restraints.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices reflect a misunderstanding of the specific interventions associated with physical versus chemical restraints. For instance, mistaking the administration of haloperidol as a physical restraint intervention or neglecting the importance of monitoring respiratory status during physical restraint use. Additionally, assuming that offering fluids is solely related to chemical restraints reveals a lack of understanding of basic patient care principles during restraint use.",
