He took 20 units of insulin lispro at 07:00 before breakfast. \n**B:** Mr. Jones has a 20-year history of type 1 diabetes, managed with insulin. He reports good adherence to his insulin regimen, but occasionally experiences hypoglycemia. His last HbA1c was 7.8% three months ago.\n**A:** At 09:00, Mr. Jones's blood glucose is 55 mg/dL. He is alert and oriented, but diaphoretic and slightly anxious. Vital signs are stable but trending towards tachycardia. We administered 15 grams of oral glucose and rechecked his blood glucose in 15 minutes.\n**R:** Blood glucose is now 85 mg/dL at 09:15. Continue to monitor blood glucose levels every hour for the next few hours. Educate the patient on recognizing hypoglycemia symptoms and appropriate actions. Discuss adjusting insulin dosage with the provider if hypoglycemia continues. Call provider if blood glucose is less than 70 mg/dL at next check. Recommend patient eat a complex carbohydrate snack to prevent rebound hypoglycemia. Ensure patient understands the importance of consistent meal times in relationship to insulin administration. Scheduled for discharge at 17:00. Document patient education."
