Attempted to redirect patient and provide a calm environment, but unsuccessful. Mr. Jones attempted to strike a nurse.\n\n14:45: Physician notified of patient's escalating aggression. New order received for haloperidol 5mg IM PRN agitation. Also order received for physical restraints PRN if patient continues to be a danger to self or others.\n\n15:00: Haloperidol 5mg IM administered. Patient placed in a quiet room with continuous observation. Still agitated, yelling, and attempting to get out of bed.\n\n15:15: Despite haloperidol administration, patient remains combative and continues to pose a safety risk. Physical restraints applied to all four extremities per protocol. Ongoing monitoring of circulation, skin integrity, and vital signs initiated.\n\n15:30: Patient continues to struggle against restraints. Neuro checks performed q15 minutes. Offering fluids. Encouraging to verbalize feelings."
