    "correct": "Hemodynamic parameters are crucial for identifying and managing different shock states. \n\n*   **(r1) Hypovolemic Shock:** Characterized by decreased circulating volume (low CVP and PAWP) leading to reduced cardiac output. The body compensates by increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to maintain blood pressure.\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** Volume loss (e.g., hemorrhage, dehydration) reduces preload, impairing ventricular filling and stroke volume. The sympathetic nervous system activates, causing vasoconstriction and increased SVR.\n\n*   **(r2) Cardiogenic Shock:** Occurs when the heart's pumping ability is compromised, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased preload (high CVP and PAWP). The body attempts to compensate by increasing SVR.\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** Myocardial infarction, severe heart failure, or valvular dysfunction impairs ventricular contractility. This results in blood backing up into the pulmonary circulation (high PAWP) and systemic circulation (high CVP).\n\n*   **(r3) Septic/Distributive Shock:** Results from widespread vasodilation (low SVR) due to an overwhelming inflammatory response. Cardiac output may initially be high as the heart attempts to compensate for the decreased resistance.\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** Inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, nitric oxide) cause vasodilation, leading to decreased SVR and maldistribution of blood flow. Capillary permeability increases, contributing to fluid shifts and hypovolemia.\n\n*   **(r4) Cardiogenic Shock (Right Heart Failure Focus):** Right ventricular failure leads to increased CVP (right atrial pressure) and reduced cardiac output. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) may be normal if the left ventricle is functioning adequately. SVR increases as a compensatory mechanism.\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** Right ventricular infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary hypertension can impair right ventricular function. This leads to blood backing up into the systemic circulation (high CVP) and reduced blood flow to the left ventricle, decreasing cardiac output.\n",
    "incorrect": "SVR is not exclusively low in distributive shock; it can be elevated in other shock states as a compensatory mechanism. CVP and PAWP are not always elevated in cardiogenic shock, especially in early stages or with right ventricular involvement. Cardiac output is not always high in septic shock; it can decrease as the condition progresses.",

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "In early septic shock, cardiac output may be elevated due to the body's attempt to compensate for vasodilation. However, as the condition progresses, cardiac output can decrease.",
      "Right ventricular failure can cause elevated CVP with a normal PAWP.",
      "SVR is a key indicator of vascular tone and is influenced by various factors, including sympathetic nervous system activity and vasoactive medications."
