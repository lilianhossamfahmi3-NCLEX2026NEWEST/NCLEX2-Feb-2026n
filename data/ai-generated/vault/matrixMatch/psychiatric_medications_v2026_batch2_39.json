He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. \n**07:05** B: Admitted 3 days ago for major depressive disorder. Started on sertraline 50mg PO daily. History of non-compliance with previous antidepressant trials.  \n**07:10** A: Client reports muscle rigidity and tremors. Noted shuffling gait. Temperature 38.8°C (101.8°F), HR 110 bpm, BP 160/90 mmHg. Labs show elevated CPK and WBC. Disoriented to time and place. \n**07:15** R: Recommend holding sertraline, STAT labs including serum serotonin, and initiating cooling measures. Notify provider of potential serotonin syndrome. Monitor vital signs closely and assess for worsening symptoms. Consider neurology consult."
