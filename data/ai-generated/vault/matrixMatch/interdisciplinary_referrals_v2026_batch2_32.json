She has left-sided weakness and difficulty swallowing.\nBackground: History of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), and type 2 diabetes. CT scan confirmed right MCA stroke. Alteplase was administered within the appropriate window. \nAssessment: Neurological assessment at 06:00 reveals GCS of 14 (E4, V4, M6). Left-sided weakness is present (3/5 strength). Speech is slurred, and patient coughs after attempting to swallow water. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 90 bpm and irregular, oxygen saturation is 94% on 2L nasal cannula. Dysphagia screening positive. \nRecommendation: Request speech therapy consult for swallowing evaluation. Consider occupational therapy referral for assistance with ADLs and adaptive equipment. Monitor blood pressure and neurological status closely. Continue oxygen therapy and administer medications as ordered. Social work consult to assess home environment and support system."
