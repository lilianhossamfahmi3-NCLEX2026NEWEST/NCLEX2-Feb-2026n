    "correct": "Withdrawal syndromes vary significantly in severity and potential danger. \n\n**(r1 & r4) Alcohol and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal:** These are the most dangerous due to their impact on the GABA-receptor system. Abrupt cessation can lead to life-threatening complications like seizures and delirium tremens (DTs). The pathophysiology involves GABA downregulation and glutamate upregulation, causing neuronal hyperexcitability. Without GABA's inhibitory effect, the central nervous system becomes overstimulated, leading to seizures, hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Immediate medical intervention is crucial.\n\n**(r2) Opioid Withdrawal:** While extremely uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal is rarely fatal in otherwise healthy adults. Symptoms arise from the body's dependence on exogenous opioids. When these are removed, the body experiences an overactivity of the noradrenergic system, leading to flu-like symptoms such as piloerection, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal distress. The locus coeruleus, a brain region rich in noradrenergic neurons, plays a key role in these symptoms.\n\n**(r3) Cocaine/Stimulant Withdrawal:** This withdrawal is characterized by a 'crash' phase, marked by profound depression, hypersomnia, and intense cravings. This occurs due to the depletion of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the brain. Stimulants artificially elevate these neurotransmitters; when the drug is stopped, the brain experiences a significant deficit, leading to the depressive symptoms. Suicide risk is a major concern during this phase.",
    "incorrect": {
      "r1": "Incorrect. Opioid withdrawal does not typically cause seizures; that is a cue for alcohol/benzos.",
      "r2": "Incorrect. Tremors, tachycardia, and seizures are more indicative of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.",
      "r3": "Incorrect. Anxiety, agitation, and seizure risk are more characteristic of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.",
      "r4": "Incorrect. Profound depression, hypersomnia, and intense cravings are more indicative of stimulant withdrawal."
