Home medications include albuterol inhaler PRN and tiotropium inhaler daily. \n\n07:15 Assessment reveals patient is using accessory muscles to breathe. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. He is alert and oriented but appears anxious. Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. \n\n07:30 Albuterol nebulizer treatment initiated. Oxygen initiated via nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Continuous SpO2 monitoring in place. \n\n08:00 Patient reports slight improvement in breathing. Oxygen saturation now 92% on 2L/min. Repeat assessment reveals decreased wheezing. \n\n09:00 Patient reports feeling more comfortable. Oxygen saturation 94% on 2L/min. ABG drawn for analysis. Will update provider with results."
