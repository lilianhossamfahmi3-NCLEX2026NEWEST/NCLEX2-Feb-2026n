    "correct": "Personality disorders are enduring, inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that deviate markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, are pervasive and inflexible, are stable over time, and lead to distress or impairment. \n\n*   **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):** Characterized by intense emotional instability, unstable relationships, a distorted self-image, and marked impulsivity. 'Splitting' is a common defense mechanism where individuals view others as either all good or all bad. The underlying fear of abandonment drives much of the behavior. Pathophysiologically, BPD is associated with abnormalities in brain regions involved in emotional regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development.\n\n*   **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD):** Defined by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others. Individuals with ASPD often exhibit a lack of empathy, impulsivity, deceitfulness, and a history of criminal behavior. Neurological studies suggest reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for impulse control and moral reasoning. Genetic predisposition and adverse childhood experiences play a significant role.\n\n*   **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD):** Marked by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, and a lack of empathy. Individuals with NPD often believe they are special and entitled. Psychodynamic theories suggest that NPD stems from unmet needs for validation and a fragile self-esteem. They may exploit others to achieve their own goals. \n\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD):** Characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. Unlike Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), OCPD does not involve true obsessions and compulsions. Individuals with OCPD are driven by a need to maintain control and avoid mistakes. Cognitive-behavioral theories suggest that OCPD is associated with rigid thinking patterns and a fear of losing control.",
    "incorrect": "Avoidant Personality Disorder (not shown) is characterized by extreme shyness, feelings of inadequacy, and sensitivity to negative evaluation. Individuals with Avoidant Personality Disorder fear rejection and criticism, leading them to avoid social situations. This differs from the need for control seen in OCPD.",

      "**SBAR Example (0700):**\n\n*   **Situation:** Mr. Jones, a 35-year-old male with Borderline Personality Disorder, is experiencing increased anxiety and expressing feelings of abandonment.\n*   **Background:** Admitted yesterday following a suicide attempt. History of unstable relationships and self-harm. Currently on fluoxetine 20mg daily.\n*   **Assessment:** Patient is pacing, exhibiting rapid speech, and stating, \"Everyone always leaves me.\" Denies current suicidal ideation but reports feeling overwhelmed. Vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 90, RR 18.\n*   **Recommendation:** Recommend offering PRN lorazepam 1mg PO for anxiety. Continue to monitor for suicidal ideation and provide supportive therapy. Reinforce coping skills.\n\nFor a client with Borderline Personality Disorder, consistent limit-setting by the nursing staff is essential to prevent 'splitting' (playing staff against each other). A structured environment and clear communication are crucial.",

      "howToOvercome": "Remember: OCD involves true obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety). OCPD is a 'personality' trait of being a control-freak/perfectionist without specific rituals. OCPD is ego-syntonic (behaviors align with self-image), while OCD is ego-dystonic (behaviors are distressing)."
