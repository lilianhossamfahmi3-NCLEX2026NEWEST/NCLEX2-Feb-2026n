        "correct": "Personality disorders are characterized by inflexible and enduring behavior patterns that deviate significantly from cultural expectations, causing distress or impairment. \n\n*   **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):** Marked by emotional dysregulation, unstable relationships, distorted self-image, and impulsivity. 'Splitting' is a defense mechanism where individuals view others as all good or all bad. The fear of abandonment is a core feature.\n\n*   **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD):** Defined by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others. Individuals with ASPD often lack empathy, are impulsive, deceitful, and may have a history of criminal behavior.\n\n*   **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD):** Characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, and a lack of empathy. Individuals with NPD often believe they are special and entitled.\n\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD):** Characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, often at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. Unlike Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), OCPD does not involve true obsessions and compulsions.",
        "incorrect": "Avoidant Personality Disorder (not listed) is characterized by extreme shyness, feelings of inadequacy, and sensitivity to negative evaluation. Individuals with Avoidant Personality Disorder fear rejection and criticism, leading them to avoid social situations. This differs from the need for control seen in OCPD.",

            "**SBAR Example (0700):**\n\n*   **Situation:** Mr. Jones, a 35-year-old male with Borderline Personality Disorder, is experiencing increased anxiety and expressing feelings of abandonment.\n*   **Background:** Admitted yesterday following a suicide attempt. History of unstable relationships and self-harm. Currently prescribed fluoxetine 20mg daily.\n*   **Assessment:** Patient is pacing, exhibiting rapid speech, and stating, \"Everyone always leaves me.\" Denies current suicidal ideation but reports feeling overwhelmed. Vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 90, RR 18.\n*   **Recommendation:** Recommend offering PRN lorazepam 1mg PO for anxiety. Continue to monitor for suicidal ideation and provide supportive therapy. Reinforce coping skills.\n\nFor a client with Borderline Personality Disorder, consistent limit-setting by the nursing staff is essential to prevent 'splitting' (playing staff against each other). A structured environment and clear communication are crucial.",

OCPD is a personality trait characterized by perfectionism and a need for control, without specific rituals. OCPD is often ego-syntonic (behaviors align with self-image), while OCD is ego-dystonic (behaviors are distressing)."
