        "correct": "Adrenal disorders disrupt cortisol and aldosterone balance.\n\n**(r1 & r3) Cushing's Syndrome (hypercortisolism):** Excess cortisol leads to fat redistribution (trunkal obesity, moon face), protein catabolism (purple striae), and mineralocorticoid effects (sodium and water retention, leading to hypernatremia and fluid volume excess). The pathophysiology involves increased glucocorticoid receptor activation, leading to metabolic and fluid imbalances.\n\n**(r2 & r4) Addison's Disease (adrenocortical insufficiency):** Deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone results in decreased sodium reabsorption and increased potassium retention (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension). Decreased cortisol leads to hypoglycemia and impaired stress response. Increased ACTH (due to negative feedback loss) stimulates melanocytes, causing bronze-like skin pigmentation. The underlying pathophysiology involves autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex in most cases, leading to hormonal deficiencies.\n\n**(r5) Adrenal Crisis:** Sudden cessation of corticosteroids, especially in Cushing's or long-term steroid users, can precipitate acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian Crisis). The body is unable to produce sufficient cortisol to meet metabolic demands, leading to severe hypotension, hypoglycemia, and shock. This is due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during prolonged steroid use.",
        "incorrect": "Bronze skin is not a sign of Cushing's; it is a sign of high ACTH levels in primary Addison's disease, stimulating melanocytes. Cushing's syndrome presents with hypernatremia due to mineralocorticoid effects of excess cortisol, not hyponatremia.",
