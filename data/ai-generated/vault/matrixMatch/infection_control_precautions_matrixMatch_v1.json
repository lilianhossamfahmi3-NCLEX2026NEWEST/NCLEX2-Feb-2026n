    "correct": "Transmission-Based Precautions are implemented based on the pathogen's mode of transmission to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). \n\n*   **(r1) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB):** Airborne precautions are required. TB is transmitted via airborne particles (≤ 5 microns) that can remain suspended in the air for extended periods. This necessitates the use of an N95 respirator to filter out these particles and a negative pressure room to prevent the spread of the pathogen. \n\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** *M. tuberculosis* primarily affects the lungs but can disseminate to other organs. The bacteria are inhaled and initiate an inflammatory response, leading to the formation of granulomas (tubercles). These tubercles can eventually cause tissue damage and cavitation in the lungs.\n\n*   **(r2) Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile):** Contact precautions are required. *C. difficile* is transmitted via spores that can survive on surfaces for extended periods. Contact precautions include the use of gloves and gown upon entry into the patient's room. Hand hygiene with soap and water is crucial because alcohol-based hand sanitizers are ineffective against *C. difficile* spores.\n\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** *C. difficile* infection (CDI) occurs when the normal gut flora is disrupted (often by antibiotic use), allowing *C. difficile* to proliferate and produce toxins. These toxins cause inflammation and damage to the colon, leading to diarrhea and potentially pseudomembranous colitis.\n\n*   **(r3) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal meningitis):** Droplet precautions are required. *N. meningitidis* is transmitted via large respiratory droplets (> 5 microns) generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking. Droplet precautions include the use of a surgical mask when within 3-6 feet of the patient.\n\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** *N. meningitidis* colonizes the nasopharynx and can invade the bloodstream, leading to meningitis (inflammation of the meninges) and/or septicemia (blood poisoning). Meningitis can cause severe neurological complications, while septicemia can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and shock.\n\n*   **(r4) Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE):** Contact precautions are required. VRE is transmitted via direct or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment. Contact precautions include the use of gloves and gown upon entry into the patient's room. Dedicated equipment should be used for the patient, and thorough environmental cleaning is essential.\n\n    *   **Pathophysiology:** Enterococci are bacteria that normally reside in the human gut. VRE strains have acquired resistance to vancomycin, a commonly used antibiotic. VRE infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to serious complications, especially in immunocompromised individuals.",
    "incorrect": "Surgical masks do not protect against airborne particles like TB; N95 respirators are mandatory for airborne precautions. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is ineffective against C. difficile spores; soap and water must be used. Droplet precautions require a surgical mask, not an N95 respirator.",
