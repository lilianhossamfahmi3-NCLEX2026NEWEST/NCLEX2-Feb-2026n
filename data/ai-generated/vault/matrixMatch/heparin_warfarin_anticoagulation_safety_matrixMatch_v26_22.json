Background: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Warfarin started at 5mg daily. Assessment: Patient reports nosebleeds this morning. Current INR is 4.5 (reference range 0.8-1.2). Platelet count is 180,000/uL. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18, Temp 37°C. Heparin infusion rate is 1200 units/hour. Orders include daily INR and PT/PTT. Radiology report indicates no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Recommendation: Please evaluate for potential warfarin reversal and adjust heparin dosing. Consider holding the next scheduled dose of warfarin. Assess for bleeding risk and implement safety precautions. Check hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Possible Vitamin K administration? Monitor for further bleeding.",

Vitamin K is the antidote for warfarin and is indicated to reverse the effects of over-anticoagulation. Holding the next dose of warfarin allows the INR to decrease naturally. Protamine sulfate is specific to heparin reversal and is not indicated here. Increasing the heparin infusion would worsen the bleeding risk. Close monitoring for signs of internal bleeding is essential. Ambulation needs provider approval due to fall risk in a bleeding state.",

Remember the implications of combining anticoagulant medications. Ensure adequate patient education regarding bleeding precautions.",
