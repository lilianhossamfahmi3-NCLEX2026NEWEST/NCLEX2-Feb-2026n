Increasing dyspnea and edema.\n\n**Background:** History of CHF, HTN, CAD. Admitted previously for similar episodes. Meds include furosemide 40mg PO BID, lisinopril 20mg PO daily, digoxin 0.125mg PO daily. Not consistently adhering to low-sodium diet.\n\n**Assessment:** 07:00: Client reports increased shortness of breath. Auscultation reveals crackles bilaterally in lower lobes. 4+ pitting edema in lower extremities bilaterally. Weight increased by 4.5 kg since last week's clinic visit. Skin is taut and shiny. Oral mucosa is dry. 07:15 Vital signs: BP 160/90, HR 110, RR 28, SpO2 90% on room air. Noted jugular vein distention while client is sitting at 45 degrees. States he has been thirstier than normal. Urine output significantly decreased over the past 24 hours (400mL). \n\n**Recommendation:** Please evaluate client for possible increase in diuretic dosage. Assess electrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium. Monitor respiratory status closely. Consider cardiology consult if no improvement with initial interventions. Elevate legs to reduce edema. Encourage compliance with fluid restrictions."

    "correct": "Fluid volume excess (FVE) and fluid volume deficit (FVD) manifest with distinct clinical findings due to the body's attempt to maintain homeostasis. In FVE, the increased fluid volume leads to bounding pulses as the heart pumps against increased vascular pressure. Neck veins become distended (JVD) due to the increased venous pressure. Crackles in the lungs indicate fluid accumulation in the alveoli. In FVD, pulses are often weak and thready. Neck veins collapse. Tenting occurs due to decreased skin turgor from dehydration. Hematocrit increases due to hemoconcentration.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of the physiological manifestations of fluid volume imbalances. For example, selecting fluid volume deficit for bounding pulses would be incorrect because bounding pulses are associated with fluid volume excess due to the increased pressure within the vascular system. Selecting fluid volume excess for tenting would be incorrect because tenting of the skin indicates dehydration and a lack of fluid volume.",
