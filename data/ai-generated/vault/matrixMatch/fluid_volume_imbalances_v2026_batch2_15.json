Reports increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.\nBackground: Patient has a history of heart failure (HF), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Current medications include furosemide 40mg PO daily, lisinopril 10mg PO daily, and metoprolol 25mg PO BID. She has been non-compliant with her diet and fluid restrictions.\nAssessment: On admission, the patient exhibited dyspnea on exertion, with audible crackles in both lower lobes. Vital signs: HR 110 bpm, BP 170/95 mmHg, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on room air. Noted 3+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. Weight 75 kg (165 lbs). Urine output decreased over the last 24 hours to 300 mL. Skin turgor is normal. Labs pending.\nRecommendation: Continue monitoring vital signs, oxygen saturation, and edema. Administer furosemide as ordered. Restrict fluids to 1500 mL/day. Consult with dietary regarding sodium restriction education. Monitor lab results, especially electrolytes and BUN/creatinine. Elevate legs when sitting. Strict I/O monitoring."

    "correct": "In fluid volume excess (FVE), the body retains fluid, leading to increased blood volume and pressure. Bounding pulses occur due to the increased force of blood against the arterial walls. Crackles are adventitious breath sounds caused by fluid accumulation in the alveoli, indicating pulmonary edema. In fluid volume deficit (FVD), the body loses fluid, leading to decreased blood volume and dehydration. Reduced urine output is a sign of decreased kidney perfusion and fluid conservation. Elevated BUN levels can indicate dehydration, as there is less fluid to dilute the urea in the blood. Normal skin turgor without tenting is generally associated with fluid volume excess.",
    "incorrect": "Bounding pulses and crackles are signs of increased fluid volume and pressure within the vascular and pulmonary systems, making fluid volume deficit an incorrect association. Reduced urine output and elevated BUN suggest the body is retaining fluid or not filtering waste properly due to reduced fluid volume, making fluid volume excess an incorrect association. Normal skin turgor without tenting indicates adequate hydration; tenting is associated with dehydration (fluid volume deficit).",
