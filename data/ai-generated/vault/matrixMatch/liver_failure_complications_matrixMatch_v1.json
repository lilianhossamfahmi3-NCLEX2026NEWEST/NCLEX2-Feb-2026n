    "correct": "\nEnd-stage liver disease (ESLD) disrupts numerous physiological processes. \n\n*   **(r1) Hepatic Encephalopathy:** Liver damage impairs ammonia detoxification. Ammonia, a neurotoxin, accumulates in the bloodstream, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and leads to cerebral edema and altered mental status. Asterixis, a flapping tremor of the hands, is a classic sign. Lactulose, a synthetic disaccharide, promotes ammonia excretion via the stool by acidifying the colon and trapping ammonia as ammonium.\n\n*   **(r2) Ascites:** Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension (increased pressure in the portal vein) and decreased albumin synthesis. This results in fluid shifting from the intravascular space into the peritoneal cavity, causing ascites (abdominal fluid accumulation). Paracentesis (fluid removal) provides temporary relief. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist diuretic, helps reduce fluid retention by blocking aldosterone's effects in the kidneys.\n\n*   **(r3) Esophageal Varices:** Portal hypertension causes blood to back up into smaller vessels, including those in the esophagus, leading to the formation of fragile, distended varices. These varices are prone to rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding (hematemesis). Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, nadolol) reduce portal pressure, decreasing the risk of variceal bleeding. Endoscopic banding involves placing rubber bands around the varices to constrict them and prevent rupture.\n\n*   **(r4) Coagulopathy:** The liver synthesizes most clotting factors. Liver damage impairs the production of these factors, leading to coagulopathy (impaired blood clotting). This manifests as prolonged PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) and increased bruising. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for the synthesis of several clotting factors. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) contains all clotting factors and is used to rapidly correct coagulopathy in cases of active bleeding or before invasive procedures.\n",
