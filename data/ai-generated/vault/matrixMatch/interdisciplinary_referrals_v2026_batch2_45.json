        "content": "**06:00** SBAR for Mr. Johnson, room 312.\n\n**Situation:** Mr. Johnson, 78-year-old male, admitted yesterday for acute stroke with right-sided weakness. \n\n**Background:** History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. CT scan confirmed left hemisphere infarct. Currently on telemetry, IV fluids, and antihypertensives. Tolerated pureed diet yesterday, but with some coughing.\n\n**Assessment:** \n- Neuro: Alert and oriented to person only. Follows simple commands on the left side. Significant right-sided weakness noted. Speech is slurred and difficult to understand. \n- Respiratory: Clear breath sounds bilaterally. SpO2 96% on room air. No signs of respiratory distress.\n- Cardiovascular: HR 88, regular. BP 160/90. Telemetry shows sinus rhythm.\n- Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds present in all quadrants. Abdomen soft and non-tender. Noted patient coughed and choked after 2nd sip of water with AM medications.\n- Musculoskeletal: Right-sided weakness. Limited range of motion in right arm and leg.\n\n**Recommendation:** Please evaluate for speech therapy due to slurred speech and possible dysphagia. Occupational therapy consult recommended for assistance with ADLs. Physical therapy referral needed for mobility and strengthening exercises. Social work consult to assess needs and resources for discharge planning. Continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status. Will notify provider of recommendations and orders. \n\nJane Doe, RN"
