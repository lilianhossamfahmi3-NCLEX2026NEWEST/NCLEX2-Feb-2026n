Several patients are due or overdue for routine screenings based on age, gender, and risk factors.\n\nBackground: Patient A, Maria Rodriguez, 55 y.o. female, past smoker (quit 5 years ago), family history of breast cancer. Patient B, Robert Jones, 68 y.o. male, current smoker, hypertension. Patient C, Susan Lee, 25 y.o. female, sexually active, no significant family history.\n\nAssessment: Maria requires breast and lung cancer screening considerations. Robert needs cardiovascular and lung cancer screening. Susan needs cervical cancer and STI screening.\n\nRecommendation: Please schedule Maria for a mammogram and discuss lung cancer screening options (low-dose CT scan). Schedule Robert for a low-dose CT scan, lipid panel, and continue monitoring blood pressure. Schedule Susan for a Pap smear and STI testing. Discuss vaccinations with all patients. Confirm patient understanding and willingness to proceed with recommended screenings. Document all actions and patient responses in the EHR. Ensure follow-up appointments are scheduled as needed. Patient education materials provided."
