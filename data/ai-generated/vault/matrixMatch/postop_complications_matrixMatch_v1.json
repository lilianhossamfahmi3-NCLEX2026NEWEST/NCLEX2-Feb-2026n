    "correct": "(R1) Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare, life-threatening pharmacogenetic disorder triggered by certain anesthetic agents, such as volatile anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, isoflurane) and succinylcholine. The pathophysiology involves uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle, leading to sustained muscle contraction, hypermetabolism, and rapid increase in body temperature. The initial sign is often unexpected increase in end-tidal CO2, followed by muscle rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia. Dantrolene sodium is the specific antidote. (R2) Postoperative restlessness, agitation, and low oxygen saturation are classic signs of hypoxemia, which can be caused by atelectasis, a common postoperative complication. Atelectasis occurs when alveoli collapse, reducing gas exchange and leading to decreased oxygen levels in the blood. The patient's restlessness and agitation are due to cerebral hypoxia. (R3) Laryngospasm is a sudden, involuntary spasm of the vocal cords, causing airway obstruction. It can occur after extubation due to irritation of the airway. Stridor, a high-pitched whistling sound, indicates upper airway narrowing. Use of accessory muscles signifies increased effort to breathe. (R4) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. Postoperative patients are at increased risk due to immobility, surgical trauma, and hypercoagulability. Unilateral calf pain, redness, and swelling are classic signs of DVT.",
