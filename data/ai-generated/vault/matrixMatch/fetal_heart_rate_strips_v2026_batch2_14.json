Pain level is 7/10. \n\n14:00 Objective: Cervix is 3 cm dilated, 50% effaced, and -2 station. Fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline is 135 bpm with moderate variability. Some decelerations are noted on the fetal heart rate tracing. Amniotic fluid clear upon artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) at 14:15.\n\n14:30: After AROM, several variable decelerations noted, some dropping to 70 bpm for 45 seconds.\n\n15:00: FHR baseline remains 135 bpm. Late decelerations now present, starting at the peak of contractions and resolving after the contraction ends.\n\n15:30: Position change attempted with minimal improvement. Oxygen initiated via face mask at 8 L/min.\n\n15:30 Assessment: FHR tracing now demonstrates persistent late decelerations and occasional variable decelerations. Contractions remain strong and frequent. \n\n15:30 Recommendation: Notify provider immediately regarding non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. Possible need for expedited delivery.\n\n15:30: Dr. Smith notified. Orders received and implemented (see orders tab)."
