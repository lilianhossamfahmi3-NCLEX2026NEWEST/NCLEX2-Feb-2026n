Patient B (Jane Doe, 52yo female, postmenopausal, family history of breast cancer). Patient C (Maria Rodriguez, 28yo female, sexually active, no significant medical history). Patient D (Robert Jones, 45yo male, sedentary lifestyle, elevated cholesterol).\n\nAssessment: Patient A requires lung cancer screening due to age and smoking history. Patient B needs a mammogram due to age and family history. Patient C needs a Pap smear per guidelines. Patient D requires a colonoscopy due to age and elevated cholesterol.\n\nRecommendation: Please verify and schedule the appropriate screenings as outlined above. Contact provider with any questions. Ensure patient education is provided before each screening. Verify insurance coverage prior to scheduling. Schedule follow-up appointments as necessary.
