        "correct": "ACLS algorithms prioritize interventions based on the underlying electrical activity.\n\n**(r1) VF/pVT: Defibrillation (Immediate/Shockable)** VF and pVT are characterized by chaotic electrical activity preventing effective cardiac output. Defibrillation aims to depolarize the entire myocardium simultaneously, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker to regain control. The rapid, unsynchronized firing of ventricular cells in VF/pVT renders the heart unable to contract effectively, leading to pulselessness and imminent death if untreated. Defibrillation delivers a high-energy electrical shock to depolarize the heart muscle, interrupting the chaotic electrical activity and allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to resume its role as the primary pacemaker.\n\n**(r2 & r3) Asystole/PEA: CPR and Epinephrine (Non-Shockable)** Asystole represents the complete absence of electrical activity. PEA involves organized electrical activity without a palpable pulse, indicating a mechanical failure of the heart. In asystole, there is no electrical activity to shock. In PEA, the electrical activity is present, but the heart muscle is not responding effectively, often due to underlying causes like hypovolemia, hypoxia, or massive pulmonary embolism. CPR provides artificial circulation and oxygenation, while epinephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor and cardiac stimulant, increases systemic vascular resistance and improves coronary perfusion pressure, potentially improving the heart's responsiveness to electrical impulses.\n\n**(r4) Unstable Ventricular Tachycardia with a pulse: Synchronized Cardioversion** Synchronized cardioversion delivers a timed electrical shock that is synchronized with the patient's R wave. This avoids delivering the shock during the relative refractory period (T wave), which could induce ventricular fibrillation. Unstable ventricular tachycardia with a pulse indicates a rapid ventricular rate compromising cardiac output and causing symptoms like hypotension, altered mental status, or chest pain. Synchronized cardioversion delivers a controlled electrical shock timed to coincide with the R wave of the QRS complex, depolarizing the myocardium and interrupting the abnormal electrical circuit causing the tachycardia. The synchronization prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period of repolarization (T wave), which could potentially trigger ventricular fibrillation.\n\n**SBAR Example (150 words):**\n\n**Situation:** \"This is [Your Name], RN, calling from [Unit] regarding Mr./Ms. [Patient Name], MRN [Patient MRN], who is experiencing unstable ventricular tachycardia with a pulse of 180 at 1400. The patient is hypotensive with a BP of 80/50, reporting chest pain, and is increasingly confused.\"\n\n**Background:** \"The patient has a history of [Relevant Medical History, e.g., coronary artery disease, heart failure]. They were admitted for [Reason for Admission] and have been on telemetry monitoring. Current medications include [Relevant Medications].\"\n\n**Assessment:** \"The patient's rhythm is confirmed as ventricular tachycardia on the monitor. They are diaphoretic, and their oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. I have applied oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. A 12-lead ECG is in progress.\"\n\n**Recommendation:** \"I recommend immediate synchronized cardioversion to restore a stable rhythm. I have gathered the necessary equipment and personnel. Please advise on the appropriate energy level for cardioversion and if any pre-medication is indicated. I also recommend a stat cardiology consult after cardioversion.\"",
        "incorrect": "Shocking asystole will not restore a rhythm and delays necessary compressions. Focusing on defibrillation for non-shockable rhythms wastes critical time that should be spent on CPR and addressing the underlying cause of the arrest. Cardioversion is inappropriate for pulseless rhythms and can be dangerous.",
