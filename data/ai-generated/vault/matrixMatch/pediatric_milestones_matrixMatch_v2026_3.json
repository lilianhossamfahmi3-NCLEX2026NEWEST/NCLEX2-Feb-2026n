Background: Mother reports that Leo was born at term with no complications. He has been meeting most developmental milestones, but she has some concerns about his mobility and social interaction. Assessment: On physical examination, Leo appears healthy and well-nourished. Vitals are within normal limits. He is able to sit unsupported for a short period. Leo transfers objects from one hand to the other but does not yet crawl. When a stranger approaches, Leo shows some anxiety. He babbles simple sounds like 'mama' and 'dada' without directed intent. Mother is concerned about his social interaction and mobility. Recommendation: Continue to monitor Leo's development, focusing on encouraging crawling and social interaction. Provide anticipatory guidance to the mother regarding age-appropriate activities and potential interventions if developmental delays persist. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months."
