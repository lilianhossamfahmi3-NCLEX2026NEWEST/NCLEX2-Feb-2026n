        "content": "0700: SBAR for Mr. Jones:\nSituation: Mr. Jones, 62-year-old male, admitted yesterday with severe ARDS secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Rapidly declining respiratory status despite initial interventions.\nBackground: History of GERD and recent stroke affecting swallowing. Developed fever and productive cough 3 days prior to admission. Initial ABG showed respiratory acidosis, worsening despite oxygen therapy. CXR reveals bilateral infiltrates.\nAssessment: Currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. FiO2 0.70, PEEP 14 cm H2O, RR 24, TV 420 mL. SpO2 90-92%, ETCO2 48 mmHg. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally, with diminished breath sounds in the bases. Patient is restless and appears anxious despite sedation (Propofol 20 mcg/kg/min).\nRecommendation: Consider further adjustments to ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Evaluate for prone positioning. Obtain updated ABG in one hour. Assess for signs of barotrauma. Monitor sedation level and ensure patient comfort. Continue frequent suctioning as needed. Discuss with respiratory therapy for possible APRV mode.\n0730: Called respiratory therapy to bedside for evaluation. Orders clarified with provider for permissive hypercapnia strategy.\n0800: Initiated prone positioning per order. Patient tolerated the position change well. Secured all lines and tubes. Will reassess in 2 hours.\n0830: Repeat ABG obtained. Pending results. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status. "
