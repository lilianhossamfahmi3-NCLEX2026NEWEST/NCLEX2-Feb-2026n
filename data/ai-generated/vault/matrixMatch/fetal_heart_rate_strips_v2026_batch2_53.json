Reports contractions every 3-5 minutes, lasting 60 seconds. Moderate amount of clear fluid noted upon rupture.\nBackground: Ms. Vance's prenatal course was uncomplicated. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) status is positive; antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin initiated per protocol at 12:30. Denies allergies. Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) in the 130s upon admission.\nAssessment: Current FHR monitoring reveals recurrent variable decelerations, with drops to 90 bpm lasting 45 seconds, coinciding with contractions. Contraction strength moderate by palpation. Cervical exam at 13:30 revealed 7 cm dilation, 90% effacement, and fetal head at 0 station. Maternal vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 37.1°C. Patient reports increasing pain despite epidural analgesia initiated at 13:00.\nRecommendation: Recommend evaluation by obstetrician for possible amnioinfusion or other interventions to address the recurrent variable decelerations. Continue monitoring maternal and fetal status closely. Consider adjusting epidural for pain management."
