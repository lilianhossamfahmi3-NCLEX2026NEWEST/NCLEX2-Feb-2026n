He's attempting to remove his IV and Foley catheter. \n\nBackground: Admitted three days ago for pneumonia. History of mild cognitive impairment. Initially cooperative, but his mental status has declined over the past 24 hours. He's oriented to self only. \n\nAssessment: Patient is restless, pulling at lines. Vital signs at 14:00: BP 160/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L NC, Temp 38.5°C. Lungs with coarse crackles bilaterally. Labs pending. He is confused and disoriented. Physical exam reveals skin tear on left forearm from attempted IV removal. No known allergies. Risk for falls and injury to self. \n\nRecommendation: Requesting orders for restraint management to ensure patient safety and prevent further injury. Consider both physical and chemical options. Please assess and advise. Need order for STAT labs to rule out delirium etiology. Will monitor vitals q15 minutes.\n14:15: Attempted to remove Foley catheter. Secured lines with tape. Continues to yell out. Re-oriented to time and place. Unsuccessful.\n14:30: Assisted back to bed after attempt to ambulate without assistance. Notified family of status change."
