            "Administer sublingual nitroglycerin.": "Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and relieving chest pain. However, given the patient's hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg) and reported use of sildenafil (Viagra), nitroglycerin is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension. Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), and concurrent use with nitrates can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure.",
            "Administer morphine sulfate IV.": "Morphine sulfate is indicated for pain management and to reduce anxiety in patients experiencing an MI. It also has venodilatory effects, which can decrease preload and myocardial oxygen demand. It should be used cautiously and blood pressure monitored closely.",
            "Administer aspirin 325 mg PO.": "Aspirin is a crucial antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation in the coronary artery. It is indicated for all patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) unless contraindicated (e.g., allergy, active bleeding).",
            "Initiate oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.": "Oxygen therapy is indicated to improve oxygen saturation and reduce myocardial ischemia. Titrate to maintain SpO2 > 90%.",
            "Prepare for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).": "PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy for patients with STEMI. It involves mechanically opening the blocked coronary artery to restore blood flow to the myocardium. Rapid preparation for PCI is essential to minimize myocardial damage.",
            "Administer IV fluids (normal saline bolus).": "Hypotension in the context of an acute MI can worsen myocardial ischemia. A cautious IV fluid bolus can help improve blood pressure and maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs. Monitor the patient closely for signs of fluid overload or pulmonary edema.",
            "Administer metoprolol IV.": "Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, can reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand. However, in the acute phase of STEMI with hypotension, IV beta-blockers are contraindicated as they can worsen hypotension and cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers are typically initiated later in the hospital course once the patient is stabilized.",
            "Administer alteplase (tPA).": "Alteplase (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve blood clots. While it can be an effective reperfusion strategy, it is contraindicated in this patient due to the planned PCI. Administering a thrombolytic followed by PCI can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Furthermore, the patient's hypotension also makes him a higher risk for bleeding with thrombolytics."

            "Sildenafil (Viagra) is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction. It is absolutely contraindicated with nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) due to the risk of severe, life-threatening hypotension.",
            "Hypotension in acute MI needs careful management. While fluids can improve perfusion, they should be administered cautiously to avoid pulmonary edema, especially if there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.",
            "Time is muscle! Rapid identification and treatment of STEMI with either PCI or thrombolytics (when PCI is not readily available) are crucial to minimize myocardial damage and improve patient outcomes."

        "questionTrap": "The critical trap here is the interaction between sildenafil and nitroglycerin. Many students know nitroglycerin is good for chest pain, but they may overlook the contraindication of its use with sildenafil, potentially leading to a dangerous choice.",
        "mnemonic": "MONA BASH (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin, Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Statin, Heparin) - This mnemonic helps recall the general management of ACS, but remember that specific contraindications (like sildenafil use) can modify the treatment plan.",
