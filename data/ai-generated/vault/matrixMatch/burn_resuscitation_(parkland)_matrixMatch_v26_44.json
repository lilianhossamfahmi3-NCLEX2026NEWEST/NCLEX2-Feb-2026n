    "stimulus": "A 62-year-old male is admitted to the burn unit after sustaining full thickness burns to 40% of his total body surface area (TBSA) in a house fire. The patient weighs 75 kg. Use the Parkland formula to calculate the fluid resuscitation needs for the first 8 hours post-burn. Titrate IV fluids to maintain adequate urine output.",

      "SBAR": "Situation: Mr. Jones is a 62-year-old male admitted at 08:00 to the burn unit after a house fire. He sustained full thickness burns to 40% TBSA. Background: The fire occurred at 06:00. Patient weighs 75 kg. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Assessment: The patient is intubated due to airway edema. Initial vital signs: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR vent-dependent, SpO2 98% on FiO2 40%. He is currently receiving lactated ringers at 250 mL/hr. Burn areas include the anterior trunk, entire left arm, and anterior left leg. Urine output is currently minimal (5 mL/hr). Recommendation: Please evaluate the current fluid resuscitation plan. Calculate the appropriate IV fluid rate per Parkland formula for the next 8 hours. Monitor urine output hourly and adjust fluids to maintain 30-50 mL/hr. Check electrolytes hourly. Consider colloid administration if urine output remains low despite adequate crystalloid infusion. Provide pain management as needed. Consider escharotomies if extremity circulation is compromised.",

      "Vitals": "Initial vitals (08:00): HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR vent-dependent, SpO2 98% on FiO2 40%. Current vitals (09:00): HR 115 bpm, BP 95/65 mmHg, RR vent-dependent, SpO2 99% on FiO2 40%.",
      "Radiology": "Chest X-ray: Diffuse interstitial edema, consistent with inhalation injury.",

      "correct": "The Parkland formula dictates that the total fluid requirement in the first 24 hours is 4 mL x % TBSA x body weight (kg). Half of this total volume should be administered in the first 8 hours. For this patient: 4 mL x 40% x 75 kg = 12000 mL. Half of this in the first 8 hours is 6000 mL. 6000 mL / 8 hours = 750 mL/hr. However, the patient has inhalation injury (CXR shows edema) and potential hypertension, thus increasing the initial rate from 750 to 1000mL/hr may be necessary to counter third-spacing and account for insensible losses that are much higher with full thickness burns and lung injury. Rates lower (500mL/hr) or much higher (1500mL/hr) are inappropriate in this case. Higher rates should be only used in cases of severe shock and after confirmation of hypovolemia.",
