    "correct": "ECG interpretation hinges on understanding the relationship between P-waves and QRS complexes. \n\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib):** (r1) is characterized by a chaotic, irregular atrial activity due to multiple re-entrant circuits within the atria. This disorganized electrical activity results in the absence of distinct P-waves and an irregularly irregular ventricular response. The atria are essentially quivering instead of contracting effectively, leading to a loss of atrial kick and potential for thrombus formation.\n\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):** (r2) is a rapid, regular rhythm originating above the ventricles. The heart rate is typically greater than 150 bpm, and the P-waves are often difficult to discern as they may be buried within the preceding T-waves due to the rapid rate. The rapid rate reduces ventricular filling time and can compromise cardiac output.\n\n*   **Third-Degree (Complete) Heart Block:** (r3) occurs when there is complete electrical dissociation between the atria and ventricles. The atria and ventricles beat independently of each other, resulting in P-waves and QRS complexes that have no relationship. The ventricular rate is typically slow (20-40 bpm) and is determined by an escape pacemaker in the ventricles. This severely compromises cardiac output.\n\n*   **First-Degree Heart Block:** (r4) represents a delay in conduction through the AV node. It is characterized by a consistently prolonged PR interval (>0.20 seconds). Each P-wave is still followed by a QRS complex, indicating that conduction is occurring, but it is slowed. First-degree AV block is usually asymptomatic.",
    "incorrect": "Atrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregular rhythm, while SVT and first-degree heart block typically present with regular rhythms. Confusing the PR interval duration is a common error.",

      "**Clinical Pearl:** In a patient with A-fib, the primary concern is the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly stroke, due to stasis of blood in the atria. Anticoagulation is a critical component of management.",
