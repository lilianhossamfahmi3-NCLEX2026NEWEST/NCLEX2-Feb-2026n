    "correct": "Accurate classification is required for monitoring and reversal planning. \n\n(r1 & r4) Apixaban and Rivaroxaban are Factor Xa inhibitors. These medications competitively and selectively inhibit Factor Xa, a crucial step in the coagulation cascade, preventing the formation of thrombin and subsequent clot formation. They are administered orally and offer predictable pharmacokinetics, reducing the need for routine monitoring.\n\n(r2) Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor. It directly binds to and inhibits thrombin, preventing it from converting fibrinogen to fibrin, a key component of blood clots. This direct action provides a more predictable anticoagulant effect compared to indirect thrombin inhibitors.\n\n(r3) Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWHs like enoxaparin potentiate the action of antithrombin III, which then inhibits several coagulation factors, including Factor Xa and thrombin. Enoxaparin has a longer half-life and more predictable anticoagulant effect than unfractionated heparin, allowing for subcutaneous administration and less frequent monitoring.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of anticoagulant drug classes and their mechanisms of action. LMWH is always injectable; Factor Xa inhibitors like apixaban are oral. Review the specific mechanisms of action for each drug class to improve comprehension.",

      "Enoxaparin should be administered subcutaneously in the 'love handles' (lateral abdomen) and the injection site should not be massaged to prevent hematoma formation and ensure optimal absorption. Rotate injection sites to minimize skin irritation.",
