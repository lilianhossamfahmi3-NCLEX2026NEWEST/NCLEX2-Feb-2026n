    "correct": "Accurate classification is essential for safe medication administration, monitoring, and reversal planning.\n\n*   **Apixaban (Eliquis) and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto):** These are Factor Xa inhibitors. They selectively inhibit Factor Xa, preventing thrombin formation and subsequent clot formation. They are administered orally and offer predictable pharmacokinetics, reducing the need for routine monitoring.\n*   **Dabigatran (Pradaxa):** This is a direct thrombin inhibitor. It directly binds to and inhibits thrombin, preventing fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, a key component of blood clots. This direct action provides a more predictable anticoagulant effect.\n*   **Enoxaparin (Lovenox):** This is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWHs potentiate antithrombin III, which inhibits coagulation factors, including Factor Xa and thrombin. Enoxaparin has a longer half-life and more predictable effect than unfractionated heparin, allowing for subcutaneous administration and less frequent monitoring.",

They should also be advised to avoid activities that increase the risk of injury.
