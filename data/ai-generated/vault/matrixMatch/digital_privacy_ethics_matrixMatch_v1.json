    "correct": "(R1) **Professional Violation:** Using a personal smartphone violates HIPAA and hospital policy. Personal devices are not secure and lack encryption, risking patient data exposure. Even with good intentions, this is a breach of confidentiality. The nurse should use hospital-approved devices with proper consent.\n(R2) **Clinically Appropriate:** Logging off a workstation is a crucial security measure. Leaving a workstation unattended while logged in allows unauthorized access to patient information. Even a brief absence requires logging off to maintain confidentiality and prevent potential breaches. This aligns with HIPAA security protocols.\n(R3) **Clinically Appropriate:** Using a secure, hospital-encrypted messaging app is appropriate for clarifying orders. These apps are designed to protect patient information and ensure secure communication between healthcare providers. This method complies with HIPAA regulations and promotes efficient, confidential communication.\n(R4) **Professional Violation:** Checking a former patient's EHR without a legitimate clinical need violates patient privacy. Accessing records out of curiosity, even after your shift, is a breach of confidentiality. Nurses should only access records of patients for whom they are currently providing care. This action disregards the 'need to know' principle and violates HIPAA regulations.",
    "incorrect": "(R1) Using personal devices for patient information, even for educational purposes, is a HIPAA violation due to lack of security and encryption.\n(R2) Leaving a workstation logged in, even briefly, poses a significant security risk.\n(R3) Unsecured communication methods can lead to HIPAA violations and compromise patient confidentiality.\n(R4) Accessing patient records without a current clinical need is a breach of privacy and violates HIPAA regulations.",

The Privacy Rule within HIPAA addresses the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Violations can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions for both individuals and healthcare organizations. The Security Rule outlines administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. Breaching these safeguards, such as using unsecured devices or accessing records without a legitimate need, compromises patient privacy and violates federal law. Healthcare organizations must implement robust policies and procedures to prevent breaches and maintain compliance with HIPAA regulations.",
