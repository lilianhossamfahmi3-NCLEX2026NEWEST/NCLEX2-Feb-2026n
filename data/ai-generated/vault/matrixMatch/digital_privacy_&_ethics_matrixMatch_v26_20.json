      "SBAR": "14:00 - Situation: We've identified multiple EHR access violations concerning patient John Smith, MRN 1234567. Background: Reviewing audit logs revealed unauthorized access by three staff members without a legitimate clinical need. Assessment: This constitutes a serious breach of patient confidentiality and HIPAA regulations. Recommendation: Immediate investigation, staff re-education on privacy policies, and potential disciplinary actions are warranted. \n\n14:15 - Situation: Update on EHR breach involving John Smith. Background: IT analysis confirms the unauthorized access occurred over a three-day period. The individuals accessed demographics, diagnosis codes, and medication lists. Assessment: Potential for identity theft and discrimination based on health information exists. Recommendation: Offer credit monitoring to the patient and enhance EHR security measures. \n\n14:30 - Situation: Follow-up regarding the EHR breach involving John Smith. Background: The three staff members involved claimed they were 'curious' about the patient's condition due to his high profile. Assessment: Curiosity is not a valid reason for accessing protected health information. Recommendation: Implement stricter access controls and mandatory ethics training.",
