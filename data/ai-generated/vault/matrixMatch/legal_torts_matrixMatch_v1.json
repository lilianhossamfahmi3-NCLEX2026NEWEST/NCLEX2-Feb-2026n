    "correct": "Nurses must operate within the legal framework to protect patient rights and avoid legal repercussions. \n\n**(r1) Assault:** Threatening a client with a sedative injection constitutes assault because it creates a reasonable apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact. The client fears imminent harm if they don't comply. \n\n**(r2) Battery:** Performing a procedure without consent is battery. Battery involves the actual harmful or offensive touching of another person without their consent. Even if the procedure is beneficial, lack of consent makes it unlawful. \n\n**(r3) False Imprisonment:** Restraining a competent client who wishes to leave Against Medical Advice (AMA) is false imprisonment. False imprisonment is the unlawful restriction of a person's freedom of movement. Competent adults have the right to refuse treatment and leave, even if it's against medical advice. \n\n**(r4) Negligence:** Failing to check a client's wristband before administering medication is negligence. Negligence occurs when a nurse fails to provide the standard of care, resulting in harm to the patient. Medication errors due to lack of verification are a common form of negligence. The nurse has a duty to verify the patient's identity, and failing to do so breaches that duty. This breach directly caused harm (medication error).",
