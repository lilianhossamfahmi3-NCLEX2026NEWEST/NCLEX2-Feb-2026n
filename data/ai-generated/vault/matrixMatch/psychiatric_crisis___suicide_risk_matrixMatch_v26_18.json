    "correct": "Increased suicide risk factors include a detailed suicide plan, feelings of hopelessness, and a history of previous attempts. A detailed plan provides the means and intent, hopelessness removes the will to live, and previous attempts indicate a pattern of behavior. These factors significantly elevate the immediate risk of another suicide attempt and require intensive intervention.\n\nExpressing feelings of hope, even amidst other struggles, signifies a protective factor against suicide, as it indicates a reason to live and a belief in a better future.",
    "incorrect": "A vague plan without details does not indicate the immediate means or intent to complete suicide, making it a lower risk than a detailed plan. A lack of previous attempts suggests the client has not previously engaged in suicidal behavior, lowering the immediate risk compared to someone with a history of attempts.",
