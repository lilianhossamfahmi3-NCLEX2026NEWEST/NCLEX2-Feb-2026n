Cervical exam reveals 1 cm dilation, 50% effacement, and -3 station. Fetal heart rate is 140 bpm with moderate variability. Membranes are intact.\nRecommendation: Continue to monitor contractions and cervical changes. Encourage ambulation and hydration. Reassess in 2 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. Consider sending home if no significant cervical change occurs."
