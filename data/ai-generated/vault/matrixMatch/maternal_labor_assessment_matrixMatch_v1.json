    "correct": "(r1) **True Labor:** Progressive cervical dilation and effacement are the hallmark signs of true labor. These changes indicate that the uterus is contracting effectively to thin and open the cervix, preparing for delivery. This is due to the release of prostaglandins and oxytocin, which stimulate uterine contractions and cervical ripening. (r2) **False Labor:** Contractions that decrease in intensity with walking or position changes are characteristic of false labor. These contractions, also known as Braxton Hicks contractions, are often irregular and do not lead to cervical change. They are thought to be caused by the uterus practicing for labor. (r3) **True Labor:** True labor contractions typically start in the back and radiate to the lower abdomen. This pattern is due to the engagement of the fetal head and the pressure it exerts on the lower back and pelvic region, stimulating nerve endings that cause pain to radiate forward. (r4) **False Labor:** Irregular contractions felt primarily in the upper abdomen and groin are indicative of false labor. These contractions are often localized and do not involve the entire uterus, and they do not cause cervical change.",
