Denies IV drug use. Admits to multiple sexual partners. No known history of liver disease. States he ate raw shellfish during his trip.\nAssessment: Physical exam reveals scleral icterus and hepatomegaly. Labs show elevated ALT and AST. Patient reports dark urine and clay-colored stools. Vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 16, Temp 37.2°C. Patient is alert and oriented x3. Reports generalized pruritus.\nRecommendation: Further investigation into cause of jaundice. Consider viral hepatitis serology. Manage symptoms with antiemetics and antipruritics. Educate patient on potential transmission routes and prevention strategies. Consult infectious disease specialist. Monitor liver function. Provide supportive care for fatigue and abdominal discomfort. Emphasize the importance of safe sexual practices."
