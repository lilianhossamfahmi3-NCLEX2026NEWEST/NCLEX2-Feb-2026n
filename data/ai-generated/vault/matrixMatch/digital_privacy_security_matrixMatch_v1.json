    "correct": "Cybersecurity is crucial for patient safety and data integrity. \n\n*   **Automatic Workstation Timeout (r1):** Correctly matched with 'A technical safeguard that locks a screen after 2 minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access (c2)'. This prevents unauthorized access to patient data if a user forgets to lock their computer. The timeout feature automatically engages, safeguarding sensitive information. \n\n*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (r2):** Correctly matched with 'A method to verify identity using at least two different categories of credentials (e.g., password + badge) (c1)'. MFA adds an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to systems, even if they have a password. This aligns with HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements.\n\n*   **Phishing Simulation (r3):** Correctly matched with 'A training tool that sends fake suspicious emails to teach staff how to spot social engineering attacks (c4)'. Phishing is a common method used by cybercriminals to steal credentials and sensitive information. Simulations help staff recognize and avoid these attacks, reducing the risk of data breaches. This proactive approach is vital in maintaining a secure environment.\n\n*   **Minimum Necessary Rule (r4):** Correctly matched with 'Standard requiring staff to only access the specific information needed for their current task (c3)'. This HIPAA principle limits access to protected health information (PHI) to only those individuals who need it to perform their job duties. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional disclosure of PHI.",
