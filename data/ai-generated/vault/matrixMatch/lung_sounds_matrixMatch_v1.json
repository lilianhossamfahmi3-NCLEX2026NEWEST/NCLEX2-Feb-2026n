    "correct": "Accurate lung sound identification is crucial for guiding appropriate and timely interventions. Differentiating between lung sounds allows the nurse to determine the underlying pathophysiology and implement targeted treatments (e.g., diuretics for fluid overload causing crackles, bronchodilators for bronchospasm causing wheezes). (r1) Crackles (Rales): Indicate fluid accumulation in the alveoli or alveolar collapse (atelectasis). In heart failure, increased pulmonary capillary pressure forces fluid into the alveoli. In atelectasis, collapsed alveoli create a popping sound upon reopening during inspiration. (r2) Wheezes (Sibilant): Suggest airway narrowing due to bronchospasm, inflammation, or edema, commonly seen in asthma. The high-pitched, musical sound results from air being forced through constricted airways. (r3) Rhonchi (Sonorous wheeze): Indicate the presence of mucus or secretions in the larger airways, often associated with bronchitis or pneumonia. The low-pitched, snoring sound is produced by air moving through the obstructed airways. (r4) Stridor: A high-pitched, crowing sound on inspiration, indicating a critical upper airway obstruction. This can be caused by foreign body aspiration, laryngeal edema (e.g., anaphylaxis), or croup. Stridor requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory arrest. (r5) Pleural Friction Rub: Results from inflammation of the pleura, causing the visceral and parietal pleurae to rub together during respiration. The grating or creaking sound is similar to that of leather rubbing together. This is often associated with pleurisy or pneumonia.",
    "incorrect": "Rhonchi can often clear with a cough as it involves larger airways, whereas crackles usually do not, as they are related to fluid or alveolar issues in the smaller airways. Misidentification can lead to inappropriate treatment and delayed recovery.",

    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Stridor is the highest priority adventitious sound; it indicates impending total airway occlusion and requires immediate intervention (e.g., Heimlich maneuver, intubation).",
      "Absence of breath sounds in a lung field is also a critical finding, potentially indicating pneumothorax, complete airway obstruction, or severe atelectasis.",
      "Auscultate lung sounds systematically, comparing side to side, to identify subtle differences.",

      "trap": "Rhonchi vs. Crackles",
      "howToOvercome": "Remember: Crackles are 'popping' (Static). Rhonchi are 'snoring' (Rumbling). In NGN, check if the sound 'clears with coughing'—that's usually Rhonchi. Also, consider the location: Rhonchi are typically heard in the larger airways, while crackles are more common in the lung bases."
