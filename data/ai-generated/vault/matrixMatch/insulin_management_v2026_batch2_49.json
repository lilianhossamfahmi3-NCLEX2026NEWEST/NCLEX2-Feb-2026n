Admitted for hyperglycemia. Home medications include: Lispro 5 units before meals, Insulin Glargine 20 units at bedtime, Metoprolol 50mg BID, and Atorvastatin 40mg daily. Last Glargine dose was at 22:00.\nA: Blood glucose trending upward. Currently 320 mg/dL. Patient alert and oriented x3. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Urine positive for ketones.\nR: Will administer 5 units Lispro per sliding scale. Check blood glucose in 1 hour. Encourage oral fluid intake. Contact provider if blood glucose remains elevated after Lispro administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of DKA. \n10/26/2026 08:00\nS: Reports feeling slightly better after insulin.\nO: Blood glucose 280 mg/dL. Continue to monitor.\n10/26/2026 09:00\nS: Blood glucose 200 mg/dL. Patient reports feeling much better. Denies any new complaints.\nO: Alert and oriented. Consuming breakfast well."
