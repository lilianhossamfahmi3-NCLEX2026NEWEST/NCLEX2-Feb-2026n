    "prompt": "The nurse is caring for a 32-year-old male patient, John Smith, admitted to the psychiatric unit following a suicide attempt. Review the patient's information and determine whether each assessment finding is a risk factor or a protective factor for suicide. Select one option for each finding.",
    "itemContext": {
      "SBAR": "14:00\nSituation: John Smith, a 32-year-old male, was brought to the ED by EMS after a suicide attempt at his home. He took an overdose of acetaminophen. \nBackground: The patient has a history of major depressive disorder diagnosed five years ago, with previous hospitalizations for suicidal ideation. He reports recent job loss (two weeks ago) and relationship issues with his partner. He has been non-compliant with his antidepressant medication (sertraline 100mg daily) for the past month. He has a history of alcohol abuse but denies current use. His father died by suicide ten years ago. \nAssessment: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but expresses feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. He admits to having ongoing suicidal thoughts but denies any current plan. Physical exam is unremarkable except for mild abdominal discomfort. Acetaminophen levels are within normal limits. The patient is tearful and withdrawn. \nRecommendation: Continue monitoring the patient closely for suicidal ideation. Consult with the psychiatrist for medication management. Initiate individual therapy sessions. Assess coping mechanisms and support systems.",

    "rationale": {
      "History of major depressive disorder": "Major depressive disorder significantly increases the risk of suicide due to the persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. The chronic nature of the disorder can lead to a sense of despair and a higher likelihood of suicidal ideation and attempts.",
      "Recent job loss": "Job loss can lead to financial strain, loss of self-esteem, and increased stress. These factors can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, contributing to suicidal thoughts, especially in individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions.",
      "Supportive relationship with family": "Strong social support from family provides a buffer against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Supportive relationships offer a sense of belonging, reduce feelings of isolation, and provide emotional and practical assistance during difficult times.",
      "Non-compliance with antidepressant medication": "Discontinuation of antidepressant medication can lead to a relapse of depressive symptoms and an increased risk of suicidal ideation. Consistent medication adherence is crucial for maintaining mood stability and preventing severe depressive episodes.",
      "Denial of current suicide plan": "While the presence of a detailed suicide plan indicates a higher imminent risk, the denial of a current plan, especially with reported prior attempts, suggests the patient is actively considering suicide but may be ambivalent. This shows some insight and may signify a higher chance of intervention success, making it a protective factor.",
      "History of alcohol abuse": "Alcohol abuse is associated with impulsivity, impaired judgment, and increased disinhibition. These factors can increase the likelihood of suicidal behavior, particularly during periods of intoxication.",
      "Expresses feelings of hopelessness": "Hopelessness is a significant predictor of suicide risk. It indicates a pervasive sense that things will not improve and that the future is bleak, leading to a diminished will to live.",
      "Father died by suicide": "A family history of suicide increases the risk of suicide due to genetic predisposition, learned behaviors, and the normalization of suicide as a potential solution to problems. This can create a vulnerability in individuals facing similar stressors.",
      "Patient expresses willingness to engage in therapy": "A willingness to engage in therapy indicates a desire for help and a recognition of the need for intervention. It suggests the patient is motivated to work on their mental health and develop coping strategies, making it a protective factor."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Always assess for both risk and protective factors when evaluating suicide risk. Focusing solely on risk factors can lead to a skewed and incomplete assessment.",
      "A patient's ambivalence about suicide can be a crucial point for intervention. Exploring and reinforcing their reasons for living can be life-saving.",
      "Non-adherence to medication is a common issue. Assess the reasons for non-adherence and address them to improve treatment outcomes."
    ],
    "questionTrap": "Be careful not to assume that the absence of a detailed plan means the patient is not at risk. Patients may deny plans but still harbor suicidal ideation. Protective factors can fluctuate; ongoing assessment is essential.",
