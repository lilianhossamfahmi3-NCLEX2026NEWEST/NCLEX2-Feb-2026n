He denies recent travel but admits to IV drug use in the past. \n\nBackground: Patient reports symptoms started approximately 2 weeks ago. He denies alcohol use. He states he had unprotected sex with multiple partners in the past. Initial labs showed elevated liver enzymes.\n\nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs stable (see vital signs tab). Physical exam reveals jaundice and mild hepatomegaly (see physical exam tab). Lab results show elevated ALT, AST, and bilirubin (see lab results tab). Differential diagnoses include Hepatitis A, B, and C. Further testing pending to confirm.\n\nRecommendation: Continue monitoring liver function. Administer antiemetics as needed for nausea. Educate patient on routes of transmission and prevention of hepatitis. Consult with infectious disease specialist is recommended. Educate on safe sexual practices and risks associated with IV drug use. Refer to substance abuse counseling. Schedule follow-up appointment to review lab results and treatment plan. Administer Hepatitis A and B vaccines if seronegative and the ID consult recommends. Provide education on post-exposure prophylaxis for contacts if needed. \n\n1500: Patient reports increased fatigue. Jaundice appears more pronounced. Abdominal pain remains stable. Continue to monitor and provide supportive care.\n"
