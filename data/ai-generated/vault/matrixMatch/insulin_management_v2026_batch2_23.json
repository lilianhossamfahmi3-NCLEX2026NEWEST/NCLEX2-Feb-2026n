Reports feeling thirsty and frequent urination.\nBackground: Diagnosed with Type 2 DM 5 years ago, managed with diet and metformin until 6 months ago when insulin was initiated due to increasing glucose levels. Allergies: NKDA. \nAssessment: Alert and oriented. BS: 280 mg/dL. HR: 92 bpm, regular. BP: 152/88 mmHg. RR: 18 bpm, regular. Temp: 98.8°F (37.1°C). Urine positive for ketones. States he took his prescribed insulin dose this morning. \nRecommendation: Evaluate insulin regimen and consider adjustments. Orders for insulin coverage per sliding scale already in place. Monitoring glucose q2h. Encourage oral fluids. Notify provider if glucose remains elevated above 300 mg/dL after next insulin dose. \n**09:00** Patient reports feeling slightly better after drinking water. Blood glucose now 260 mg/dL."
