        "correct": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy represent a spectrum of vasospastic disease processes originating from placental dysfunction.\n\n(r1) **Preeclampsia:** Characterized by new-onset hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. The underlying pathophysiology involves abnormal placentation, leading to endothelial dysfunction, vasospasm, and increased vascular permeability. This results in hypertension, proteinuria (due to glomerular damage), and potential end-organ damage.\n\n(r2) **Eclampsia:** Defined by the occurrence of new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. The exact mechanism of seizures in eclampsia is not fully understood but is thought to be related to cerebral vasospasm, edema, and ischemia. Magnesium sulfate is the primary medication used to prevent and treat eclamptic seizures.\n\n(r3 & r4) **HELLP Syndrome:** A severe complication of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. The pathophysiology involves systemic endothelial dysfunction, leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hemolysis), liver inflammation and necrosis (elevated liver enzymes), and platelet consumption (low platelet count). Right upper quadrant pain is often present due to liver swelling and distension of the Glisson's capsule.\n\n(r5) **Severe Preeclampsia:** Severe persistent headache and visual disturbances (scotomata, blurred vision) are indicative of severe preeclampsia. These symptoms are caused by cerebral vasospasm, edema, and ischemia affecting the brain and visual cortex. Immediate intervention is required to prevent seizures and other complications. Eclampsia is the actual seizure.",
        "incorrect": "HELLP syndrome can occur without hypertension or proteinuria in up to 15-20% of cases, making it difficult to diagnose without blood work. Atypical presentations require a high index of suspicion and prompt laboratory evaluation.",

Has been managed outpatient with close monitoring.\n*   **Assessment:** BP remains elevated despite oral antihypertensives. Reports headache and blurred vision.
