Onset of increased work of breathing noted at 03:00. \n07:05 Respiratory rate increased from 22 to 34, SpO2 decreased from 94% to 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Patient placed on a ventilator. Initial settings: FiO2 60%, tidal volume 6 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cm H2O. \n07:10 ABG drawn: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 60, HCO3 24. \n07:15 FiO2 increased to 70%, PEEP increased to 8 cm H2O per protocol. \n07:30 Repeat ABG: pH 7.32, PaCO2 53, PaO2 65. \n07:45 Physician ordered prone positioning. Patient tolerated proning well. \n08:00 SpO2 improved to 92% in prone position. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. Suctioned moderate amount of thick, tan secretions. \n08:30 Currently tolerating ventilator settings and prone positioning. Monitoring respiratory status closely. Continue to assess for skin breakdown related to prone positioning. \n08:45 New order received: Increase PEEP to 10 cm H2O and obtain ABG in 1 hour. Pt education provided to family regarding rationale for interventions. Family verbalized understanding.\n09:00 Pt remains hemodynamically stable. Vitals and respiratory status monitored per protocol."
