    "correct": "The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a standardized neurological assessment tool used to evaluate the level of consciousness. It assesses three components: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. (r1) Eye opening is scored from 1 to 4, with 4 indicating spontaneous eye opening. (r2) Verbal response is scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the patient is oriented to person, place, and time. (r3) Motor response is scored from 1 to 6, with 6 indicating the patient obeys commands. (r4) A total GCS score of 8 or less indicates a severe head injury and often necessitates intubation to protect the airway and prevent aspiration. This is because a GCS of 8 or less typically signifies a significantly impaired level of consciousness, increasing the risk of respiratory compromise.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect answers reflect a misunderstanding of the GCS scoring system and its interpretation. The highest possible GCS score is 15, indicating full consciousness, while the lowest possible score is 3, indicating deep unconsciousness. A score of zero is not possible as it represents the absence of any response. Misinterpreting the scoring ranges for each component can lead to inaccurate assessment of the patient's neurological status.",
