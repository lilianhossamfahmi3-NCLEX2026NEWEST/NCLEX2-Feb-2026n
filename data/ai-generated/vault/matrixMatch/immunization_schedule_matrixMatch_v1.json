    "correct": "The timing of vaccines is strategically designed to maximize immunity while minimizing the infant's or child's vulnerability to specific diseases. This schedule is based on extensive research and monitoring of disease patterns and vaccine efficacy.\n\n*   **(r1) HepB is administered at birth:** Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection. Universal vaccination at birth provides early protection, especially crucial as infants may contract the virus from infected mothers during delivery.\n\n*   **(r2) Infancy visits (2, 4, 6 months) cover core respiratory and GI pathogens:** This series of vaccinations (DTaP, RV, Hib, IPV, PCV13, and HepB at 2 and 6 months) targets diseases that pose significant risks to infants, including pertussis (whooping cough), rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, pneumococcal infections, and hepatitis B. The 4-month visit typically omits HepB if the infant received it at birth and at 2 months.\n\n*   **(r3) Living-virus vaccines (MMR, Varicella) are generally delayed until 12-15 months:** MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and Varicella (chickenpox) are live attenuated vaccines. Delaying administration until after the first year allows the infant's immune system to mature and reduces the potential for interference from maternal antibodies, which can decrease vaccine effectiveness. HepA and Hib are also given during this period, along with a PCV13 booster.\n\n*   **(r4) Adolescence includes boosters (Tdap) and protection against STIs (HPV) and meningitis:** Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) is a booster to maintain immunity against these diseases. HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination protects against common sexually transmitted infections that can lead to cervical and other cancers. Meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination protects against serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adolescents.",
    "incorrect": "MMR should not be given to an infant under 12 months unless in highly specific outbreak scenarios, due to potential interference from maternal antibodies, which can reduce the vaccine's effectiveness. Administering live vaccines too early can lead to a suboptimal immune response.",

      "Instruct parents that mild fever (up to 100.4°F or 38°C) and soreness at the injection site are normal and expected side effects. These can be managed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen (following age-appropriate dosing guidelines). However, a high fever (above 100.4°F or 38°C), inconsolable crying for >3 hours (in infants), seizures, or signs of an allergic reaction (hives, difficulty breathing) require immediate medical attention. Document the vaccine name, lot number, expiration date, and injection site in the patient's medical record.",
      "SBAR: Situation: Parent is concerned about the number of vaccines recommended at each visit. Background: The CDC's recommended immunization schedule is designed to provide optimal protection against vaccine-preventable diseases at specific ages. Assessment: The child is due for the following vaccines: [List vaccines]. Parent expresses concerns about vaccine safety and potential side effects. Recommendation: Provide evidence-based information about vaccine safety and efficacy. Address parent's specific concerns. Offer to administer vaccines separately if desired (while adhering to the recommended schedule). Document all discussions and decisions in the patient's chart.",
