        "content": "**SBAR Communication**\n\n**Situation:** G1P0 patient, Jane Doe, 39 weeks gestation, admitted at 08:00 for induction of labor due to postdates. Artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) performed at 10:15 with clear fluid noted. \n\n**Background:** Patient history unremarkable, prenatal labs within normal limits. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) status is positive; antibiotic prophylaxis initiated with IV Penicillin G 5 million units at 08:30, followed by 2.5 million units every 4 hours. Epidural anesthesia requested and administered at 11:00.\n\n**Assessment:** Currently, the patient is experiencing contractions every 2-3 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. Cervical dilation is 7 cm, and effacement is 90%. Fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline is 135 bpm with moderate variability. Several deceleration patterns have been observed. At 11:45, a deceleration to 120 bpm occurred mirroring the contraction. At 12:10, FHR dropped to 90 bpm, lasting 45 seconds, occurring after the peak of the contraction. At 12:30, a sharp drop in FHR to 80 bpm, lasting 30 seconds, was observed; the onset and nadir varied with contractions.\n\n**Recommendation:** Continue monitoring FHR closely. Consider position changes to alleviate potential cord compression. Notify the physician if late decelerations persist or if fetal heart rate variability decreases. Prepare for potential interventions based on fetal response to labor. Maintain communication with the patient regarding labor progress and pain management. Monitor maternal vital signs per protocol. Assess fetal station and position. Continue IV fluids per order. Document all interventions and patient responses in the EHR. Evaluate need for amnioinfusion if variable decelerations worsen. Request repeat vaginal exam to assess for descent. \n\n12:45 Nurse A."

    "correct": "Early decelerations are caused by fetal head compression during uterine contractions, leading to vagal stimulation and a decrease in FHR that mirrors the contraction. Late decelerations are caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, resulting in decreased oxygen transfer to the fetus. This leads to fetal hypoxia and a delayed decrease in FHR that occurs after the peak of the contraction. Variable decelerations are caused by umbilical cord compression, leading to a sudden decrease in FHR that varies in timing and depth with contractions.",

Misinterpreting early decelerations as late decelerations may lead to unnecessary interventions, such as administering oxygen or changing maternal position.
