States Samuel is not yet crawling, but scoots on his bottom to move around. Fine motor skills seem appropriate; transfers toys hand-to-hand. Seems to understand 'no' but doesn't consistently respond to name. Diet consists of pureed foods and some finger foods. No allergies reported. Sleeping through the night. \n14:15 Nurse Amy S: Vitals obtained, see 'Vitals' tab. Physical exam performed, see 'Physical Exam' tab. \n14:30 Dr. Smith: Examined patient. Motor delay noted, recommend physical therapy evaluation. Continue current diet and monitor developmental progress. Follow up in 3 months. Discussed age-appropriate play and safety measures with mother. \n14:45 Nurse Amy S: Education provided to mother regarding importance of tummy time, age-appropriate toys to promote motor development, and home safety. Mother verbalized understanding. Schedule PT eval."
