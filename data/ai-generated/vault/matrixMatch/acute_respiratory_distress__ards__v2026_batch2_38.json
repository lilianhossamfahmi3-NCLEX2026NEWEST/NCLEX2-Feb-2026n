Pt is a 67-year-old male admitted with suspected ARDS secondary to recent aspiration pneumonia. \n0705: Pt is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Initial settings: FiO2 60%, TV 450 mL, RR 20, PEEP 10 cm H2O.\n0710: ABG on vent settings reveals pH 7.28, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L, SaO2 90%. Noted increased peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) to 35 cm H2O. Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally, diminished breath sounds in the bases.\n0800: Physician notified of ABG results. Orders received and implemented: Increase PEEP to 14 cm H2O, prone positioning initiated. Monitor vital signs and respiratory status closely.\n0900: Patient repositioned prone. Secured all lines and tubes. Pressure points padded. Continuous monitoring in place. \n0930: Repeat ABG drawn. \n1000: ABG results pending. Patient tolerating prone position. PIP decreased to 28 cm H2O. SaO2 increased to 94%. \n1100: New ABG results: pH 7.35, PaCO2 45 mmHg, PaO2 80 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L, SaO2 95%. Physician notified of improvement in ABGs. Continue current plan. Keep HOB >30 degrees when supine. Frequent oral care performed. Skin integrity monitored q2h."
