He reports increased sputum production and difficulty breathing, even at rest.\nBackground: Mr. James has a long-standing history of COPD, managed with home oxygen at 2L/min. He has been stable until the last few days when his symptoms worsened. He is also a smoker with a 40-pack-year history. He denies chest pain.\nAssessment: On admission, he was noted to be tachypneic and using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation revealed diffuse wheezing and coarse crackles bilaterally. His initial SpO2 was 88% on 2L NC. ABG was drawn at 13:30. He appears anxious and fatigued. Current O2 is 4L via nasal cannula.\nRecommendation: Please evaluate the ABG results and consider adjustments to his respiratory support. Consider nebulizer treatments with bronchodilators and possible chest physiotherapy. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory distress."
