    "correct": "(r1) **Clinically Ethical:** Obtaining explicit patient consent is paramount before using any recording device, especially AI-assisted tools. This upholds patient autonomy and privacy rights, aligning with ethical guidelines for data collection and usage.\n\n(r2) **Ethical Violation:** Directly copying and pasting AI-generated text without verification introduces the risk of 'automation bias,' where the nurse trusts the AI output without critical evaluation. This can lead to inaccurate documentation, potentially harming the patient. The nurse is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the EHR. The pathophysiology here involves a failure of critical thinking and professional accountability.\n\n(r3) **Ethical Violation:** Using non-encrypted consumer-grade AI tools violates HIPAA regulations and data privacy principles. These tools often lack the necessary security measures to protect sensitive patient information, increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. The pathophysiology involves a breakdown in data security protocols, potentially exposing confidential patient data to unauthorized parties.\n\n(r4) **Clinically Ethical:** Reporting AI 'hallucinations' demonstrates a commitment to transparency and patient safety. By identifying and reporting errors, the nurse contributes to improving the AI system and preventing future inaccuracies. This proactive approach aligns with ethical principles of accountability and continuous quality improvement.",
