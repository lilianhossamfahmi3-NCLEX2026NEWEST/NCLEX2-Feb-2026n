        "correct": "Environmental justice addresses disproportionate environmental burdens on vulnerable populations.\n\n*   **Poor Indoor Air Quality (Mold/Lead):** Children are highly susceptible to lead poisoning due to their developing nervous systems and increased hand-to-mouth activity. Low-income communities often reside in older housing with lead paint and mold issues due to limited housing options and resources for remediation. Mold exposure can trigger asthma and respiratory problems, especially in children.\n\n*   **Urban Heat Island Effect:** Older adults are more vulnerable to heatstroke and heat exhaustion due to decreased thermoregulation and chronic health conditions. Low-income communities often lack access to air conditioning and green spaces, exacerbating the impact of heat islands. Concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat, increasing ambient temperatures.\n\n*   **Proximity to Toxic Waste Sites:** Children are at higher risk from exposure to toxins due to their developing organ systems and increased exposure through play and ingestion. Low-income communities are often located near industrial areas and waste sites due to zoning practices and economic factors. Exposure to toxins can lead to developmental delays, respiratory illnesses, and increased cancer risk.\n\n*   **Lack of Safe Green Spaces:** All age groups in low-income communities are affected by the lack of safe spaces for physical activity. Children need safe places to play and develop motor skills. Adults need access to exercise to maintain physical and mental health. Older adults need safe places to walk and socialize to prevent social isolation and maintain mobility.",
