Reports increased shortness of breath and productive cough.\nBackground: History of COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Home medications include albuterol inhaler, lisinopril, metformin. Vitals stable overnight until 06:30 when O2 saturation dropped to 88% on room air. Albuterol nebulizer administered at 06:45 with minimal improvement.\nAssessment: Patient is anxious, diaphoretic, and using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds with wheezing bilaterally. Productive cough with thick, yellow sputum. ABG drawn at 07:00. Current O2 saturation 90% on 2L nasal cannula.\nRecommendation: Please evaluate for possible escalation of respiratory support. Consider arterial blood gas results and further management of COPD exacerbation. \n\n07:15 SBAR for Mrs. Smith:\nSituation: Mrs. Smith, 72-year-old female, post-operative day 1 following small bowel resection. \nBackground: History of small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. NG tube to low intermittent suction in place. Complains of nausea. Received morphine 2mg IV at 06:00 for pain. \nAssessment: Patient drowsy but arousable. RR 8. Shallow respirations noted. NG tube draining large amount of greenish fluid. Electrolytes and ABG drawn at 07:10.\nRecommendation: Evaluate patient’s respiratory status and electrolyte imbalances. \n\n07:20 SBAR for Mr. Brown:\nSituation: Mr. Brown, 55-year-old male, admitted for salicylate overdose. \nBackground: History of depression. Found at home unresponsive with empty bottle of aspirin. Gastric lavage performed in the emergency department. \nAssessment: Patient alert and oriented. Complains of ringing in ears. Hyperventilating. ABG drawn at 07:15. \nRecommendation: Monitor ABG results and neurological status. \n\n07:25 SBAR for Ms. Davis:\nSituation: Ms. Davis, 48-year-old female, admitted with severe anxiety and panic attacks. \nBackground: History of anxiety disorder. Reports feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope. Has been hyperventilating for the past hour.\nAssessment: Patient appears agitated and tremulous. Complains of dizziness and tingling in fingers. ABG drawn at 07:20.\nRecommendation: Provide reassurance and encourage slow, deep breathing. Review ABG results to assess for acid-base imbalance."

    "correct": "Respiratory Acidosis (Mr. Jones): The ABG shows a pH of 7.30 (low) and a PaCO2 of 60 mmHg (high), indicating respiratory acidosis. This is consistent with his COPD exacerbation, where impaired gas exchange leads to CO2 retention. \nMetabolic Alkalosis (Mrs. Smith): The ABG shows a pH of 7.50 (high) and an elevated HCO3 of 38 mEq/L, indicating metabolic alkalosis. The NG tube suction contributes to loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), leading to metabolic alkalosis. Her potassium level of 3.0 further supports this finding, as hypokalemia often accompanies metabolic alkalosis.\nRespiratory Alkalosis (Mr. Brown): The ABG shows a pH of 7.52 (high) and a PaCO2 of 28 mmHg (low), indicating respiratory alkalosis. Salicylate overdose stimulates the respiratory center, leading to hyperventilation and a decrease in PaCO2. \nRespiratory Alkalosis (Ms. Davis): The ABG shows a pH of 7.48 (high-normal) and a PaCO2 of 30 mmHg (low), indicating respiratory alkalosis. Hyperventilation due to anxiety causes excessive CO2 excretion, leading to respiratory alkalosis.",
