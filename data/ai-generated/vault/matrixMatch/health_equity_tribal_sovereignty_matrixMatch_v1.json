    "correct": "The United States government has a unique legal and moral obligation to provide healthcare services to federally recognized tribes, stemming from treaties and agreements made with these nations. This is known as the 'trust responsibility.' (r1) The Indian Health Service (IHS) is NOT an insurance company. It is a federal agency that provides direct healthcare services through a network of hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities, primarily serving American Indians and Alaska Natives. (r2) Tribal sovereignty grants tribal nations the authority to govern themselves, including the ability to establish their own public health laws, regulations, and healthcare systems. This allows them to address the specific health needs of their communities in a culturally appropriate manner. (r3) Indigenous populations face significant health disparities due to a complex interplay of factors, including historical trauma resulting from colonization, forced assimilation, and loss of land and culture. Chronic underfunding of the IHS further exacerbates these disparities, limiting access to quality healthcare services. (r4)",
    "incorrect": "Many patients mistakenly believe that IHS functions like an insurance plan. It's crucial to clarify that IHS provides direct clinical services within its facilities or through authorized referrals. (r2) Understanding tribal sovereignty is essential for respecting tribal authority and collaborating effectively with tribal health departments. (r3) Failing to acknowledge the historical context and systemic factors contributing to health disparities can lead to ineffective or culturally insensitive care. (r4)",
