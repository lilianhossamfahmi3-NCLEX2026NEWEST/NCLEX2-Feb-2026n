        "content": "0700 SBAR Communication:\nSituation: Baby Michael, a 7-month-old male, presented to the clinic today for a routine check-up. Mother reports concerns about delayed motor skills.\nBackground: Michael was born at term without complications. He has been following his growth curve adequately. No known allergies. Immunizations are up to date.\nAssessment: Physical exam reveals a healthy-appearing infant. Upon assessment, Michael is unable to sit unsupported, and he does not transfer objects from one hand to another. He can roll from his stomach to his back but not back to stomach. He babbles but does not speak recognizable words. According to the mother, he does not bear weight on his legs when supported. He smiles and interacts with his parents appropriately. Vital signs stable.\nRecommendation: Discuss potential need for physical therapy evaluation with the pediatrician. Provide anticipatory guidance regarding developmental milestones. Encourage continued parental involvement in promoting motor and cognitive development. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 months to reassess progress. Consider Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) if no progress is made. \n1500 SBAR:\nSituation: Baby Jane, 13-month-old, here for well-child visit. Parents concerned about lack of walking.\nBackground: Born at 39 weeks gestation. No significant medical history. Feeds well, sleeps well.\nAssessment: Upon physical examination, Jane is able to pull herself to a standing position but does not cruise along furniture. She can say 'mama' and 'dada'. She demonstrates a pincer grasp and enjoys dropping objects from her highchair. Socially, she exhibits stranger anxiety and clings to her mother.\nRecommendation: Reassure parents that Jane's development is within normal limits. Encourage continued opportunities for her to practice walking. Discuss safety measures to prevent falls. Schedule routine 15-month follow up.\n1600 SBAR:\nSituation: David, 19-month-old, presents for routine checkup. Parents report normal activity.\nBackground: Born full-term. No known health issues.\nAssessment: David walks independently and can climb onto furniture. He speaks several single words and follows simple directions. He can feed himself with a spoon, though messy. He points to body parts when asked. Socially, he is affectionate with his parents and shows increasing independence.\nRecommendation: Provide anticipatory guidance regarding toddler development. Discuss toilet training readiness cues. Encourage continued language and motor skill development. Schedule routine 2-year follow-up."
