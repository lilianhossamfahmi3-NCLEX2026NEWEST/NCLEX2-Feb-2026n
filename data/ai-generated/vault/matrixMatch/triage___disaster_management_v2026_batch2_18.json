Command established at Mile Marker 112. \n\n08:45, Triage initiated on-scene. Resources stretched thin. Prioritizing based on START triage protocol.\n\n09:00, Client A: 62-year-old male, found trapped in vehicle. RR 32, radial pulse present, able to follow simple commands. Obvious femur fracture noted. \n\nClient B: 8-year-old female, found wandering near the wreckage, crying for parents. RR 24, strong radial pulse, multiple superficial lacerations. Appears anxious but responsive.\n\nClient C: 35-year-old male, unresponsive, no respirations after repositioning airway. No palpable pulse. \n\nClient D: 24-year-old female, RR 10, cap refill > 2 seconds, unable to follow commands. GCS score of 10. Multiple long bone fractures.\n\nClient E: 45-year-old male, RR 20, strong radial pulse, alert and oriented, complaining of back pain. Able to ambulate.\n\nS. Jones, RN"

Green (Minor) indicates minor injuries or illnesses that can wait for treatment. Black (Expectant) indicates patients who are unlikely to survive given available resources.",
