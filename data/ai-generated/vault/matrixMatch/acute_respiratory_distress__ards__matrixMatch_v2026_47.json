He is currently on mechanical ventilation.\nBackground: Patient initially presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray confirmed bilateral infiltrates. He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He was started on antibiotics and respiratory support upon admission.\nAssessment: Currently, patient is sedated with propofol and on assist-control ventilation. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 140/90, RR 24, SpO2 90% on FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O. ABG: pH 7.30, PaCO2 50, PaO2 65. Physical exam reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 35 cm H2O.\nRecommendation: Consider increasing PEEP to improve oxygenation. Evaluate the need for neuromuscular blockade to optimize ventilation. Monitor for signs of barotrauma. Continue antibiotic therapy and reassess chest X-ray in 24 hours. Prone positioning should be considered if oxygenation does not improve with PEEP adjustments. Monitor urine output for signs of acute kidney injury. Ensure adequate sedation and pain management. Suction PRN."
