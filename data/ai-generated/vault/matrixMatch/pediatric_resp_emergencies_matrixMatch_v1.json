    "correct": "Croup, or laryngotracheobronchitis, is a viral infection causing inflammation of the larynx and trachea. The characteristic 'seal-like' cough results from airway narrowing. Cool, moist air helps reduce swelling. Symptoms often worsen at night due to increased airway resistance in a supine position and decreased cortisol levels. Epiglottitis, typically caused by *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib), leads to rapid swelling of the epiglottis. Drooling occurs because the child cannot swallow due to pain and obstruction. High fever is a common sign of infection. The tripod position (leaning forward with hands on knees) maximizes airway opening by using accessory muscles. Epiglottitis progresses rapidly, potentially causing complete airway obstruction within hours. Immediate intubation or tracheostomy is often necessary to secure the airway.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selection indicates a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of croup, a viral infection causing airway inflammation and a characteristic barking cough, or a lack of recognition of the signs and symptoms of epiglottitis, a life-threatening bacterial infection requiring immediate airway management.",
