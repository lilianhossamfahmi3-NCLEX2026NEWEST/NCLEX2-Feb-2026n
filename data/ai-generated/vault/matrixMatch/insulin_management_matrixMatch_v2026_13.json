Blood glucose level is currently 310 mg/dL. \nBackground: Patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes, non-adherence to insulin regimen, and frequent hyperglycemic episodes. He reports inconsistent meal times and carbohydrate intake. He self-administers insulin at home. \nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented. Complains of polydipsia and polyuria. Skin is warm and dry. Initial vital signs: HR 92, BP 148/88, RR 20, Temp 99.1°F (37.3°C), SpO2 98% on room air. Current glucose 310 mg/dL. \nRecommendation: Please evaluate current insulin orders and consider adjustments to better manage his blood glucose levels. Educate patient on the importance of insulin adherence, consistent meal planning, and blood glucose monitoring. Continue to monitor vital signs and glucose levels every 2 hours. Provide patient education materials on diabetes management before discharge."
