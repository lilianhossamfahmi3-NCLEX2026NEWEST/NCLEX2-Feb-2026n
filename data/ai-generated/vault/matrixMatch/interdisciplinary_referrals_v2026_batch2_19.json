During mealtime, patient coughed forcefully and demonstrated gurgling sounds after attempting to swallow applesauce. Neurological deficits noted: mild right-sided facial droop and weakness in right arm. \nAssessment: O2 saturation 89% on 2L nasal cannula, RR 24 and labored, mild right facial droop noted, right upper extremity weakness (3/5 strength). Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. Patient reports difficulty swallowing and states, 'It feels like food is getting stuck.' Aspiration risk is high based on observed swallowing difficulties. Cognition intact. \nRecommendation: Consult Speech Therapy for swallowing evaluation; Occupational Therapy for assessment of ADL modifications given right arm weakness; Physical Therapy for mobility assessment and fall risk. Social Work consult to assess home environment and support resources. Continue to monitor respiratory status and provide pulmonary hygiene. Elevate HOB during and after meals. Keep suction equipment readily available. Encourage coughing and deep breathing exercises. Documented by RN, BSN, C. Jones."
