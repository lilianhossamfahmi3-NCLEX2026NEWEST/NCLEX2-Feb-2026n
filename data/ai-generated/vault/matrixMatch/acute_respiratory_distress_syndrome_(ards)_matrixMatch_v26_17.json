            "correct": "The patient is exhibiting signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), as evidenced by the low PaO2, elevated PaCO2, and low pH (respiratory acidosis). Increasing PEEP is indicated to improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and increasing the surface area for gas exchange. Decreasing FiO2 is not indicated as the PaO2 is already low; FiO2 should only be decreased when PaO2 is at acceptable levels to prevent oxygen toxicity. Increasing tidal volume is contraindicated due to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and barotrauma; a low tidal volume strategy (6 mL/kg) is recommended in ARDS. Increasing the respiratory rate can help reduce PaCO2, thereby improving the pH balance. Administering sodium bicarbonate is not indicated as the patient has a respiratory acidosis, and the primary focus should be on improving ventilation to eliminate CO2; bicarbonate is typically reserved for severe metabolic acidosis.",

Assessment reveals increased work of breathing, decreased oxygen saturation, and abnormal ABG results. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally.
