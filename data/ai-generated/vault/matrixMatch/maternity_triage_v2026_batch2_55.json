Need assistance in prioritizing assessment and intervention.\n\n**Background:**\n*   Patient A: G1P0 at 32 weeks gestation. Reports occasional heartburn and mild ankle swelling.\n*   Patient B: G2P1 at 38 weeks gestation. Reports severe headache, blurred vision, and epigastric pain.\n*   Patient C: G1P0 at 10 weeks gestation. Reports mild nausea and fatigue.\n*   Patient D: G3P2 at 20 weeks gestation. Reports painless vaginal bleeding.\n*   Patient E: G1P0 at 40 weeks gestation. Reports contractions every 5 minutes and lower back pain.\n\n**Assessment:**\n*   Patient A: Vital signs stable. +1 edema bilaterally. Heartburn relieved with antacids.\n*   Patient B: BP 160/100 mmHg, +3 edema, hyperreflexia noted. Possible pre-eclampsia.\n*   Patient C: Vital signs stable. Reports able to tolerate small meals.\n*   Patient D: Moderate vaginal bleeding noted. Fetal heart tones present but diminished.\n*   Patient E: Cervix dilated 4 cm, 80% effaced. Fetal heart tones stable.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n*   Patient B needs immediate evaluation for pre-eclampsia management.\n*   Patient D needs immediate ultrasound and evaluation to rule out placental abruption or previa.\n*   Patient A and C can be managed with routine prenatal care and education.\n*   Patient E is in active labor and needs admission.\n\n18:20 RN J.
