Background: Pt. has a history of type 1 diabetes for 15 years, managed with insulin. He reports missing two insulin doses due to a busy schedule. Assessment: Pt. is alert and oriented, but reports feeling thirsty and fatigued. Current blood glucose is 310 mg/dL. Vital signs: HR 102 bpm, BP 130/80 mmHg, RR 20, Temp 98.8°F (37.1°C), SpO2 98% on room air. Pt. denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Skin is warm and dry with poor skin turgor. Recommendation: Continue to monitor blood glucose levels every hour. Administer insulin as per sliding scale order. Encourage oral fluids. Educate patient on importance of adherence to insulin regimen and sick day management."

    "correct": "The correct answer matches each insulin type with its correct onset of action. Insulin Lispro (Humalog) is a rapid-acting insulin with an onset of action of less than 15 minutes. Insulin Regular (Humulin R) is a short-acting insulin with an onset of action of 30 minutes to 1 hour. Insulin Detemir (Levemir) is a long-acting insulin with an onset of action of 1-2 hours. The nurse must understand the onset, peak, and duration of different types of insulin to administer them safely and effectively.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting the incorrect onset of action for each insulin type would lead to improper timing of insulin administration, potentially resulting in hypo- or hyperglycemia. For example, if one assumes that Insulin Lispro has a delayed onset, they may administer it too early, leading to hypoglycemia once the insulin starts working. If one assumes Insulin Detemir has a rapid onset, they may delay administering it, leading to hyperglycemia as the insulin will not work as expected.",
