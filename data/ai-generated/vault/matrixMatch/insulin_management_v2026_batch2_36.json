States, \"I think I missed a dose of my insulin.\"\nB: 45-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, admitted for DKA. Diagnosed 20 years ago. Recent HbA1c was 9.5%. Currently on insulin aspart (Novolog) 5 units before meals and insulin glargine (Lantus) 20 units at bedtime. \nA: Patient is alert and oriented x3, but exhibiting signs of dehydration. Blood glucose is currently 380 mg/dL. Has received 2L of NS bolus. Potassium is 3.1 mEq/L and has potassium replacement ordered. Continuous insulin infusion started at 2 units/hr per protocol.\nR: Continue monitoring blood glucose levels every hour. Administer insulin infusion per protocol, titrating to blood glucose levels. Monitor potassium levels and administer potassium replacement as prescribed. Educate patient on importance of adherence to insulin regimen and sick day management. Call provider for blood glucose >300 after 2 hours or any concerns. 07:15 - Notified Dr. Smith of lab values and current status."
