Presenting complaint: decreased fetal movement reported by patient this morning. \n\n14:05: Assessment reveals contractions every 3-4 minutes, lasting 60-70 seconds. Cervical exam: 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, vertex at -2 station. Fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline is 135 bpm with moderate variability. \n\n14:10: Noted a deceleration in FHR that mirrors the contraction pattern, with the FHR returning to baseline by the end of the contraction. \n\n14:25: Another contraction noted, this time with a sharp drop in FHR to 90 bpm lasting approximately 45 seconds. The deceleration did not consistently occur with contractions. Patient repositioned to left lateral position. \n\n14:40: FHR now demonstrates a decrease in rate to 110 bpm approximately 30 seconds after the peak of the contraction. The FHR baseline variability remains moderate.\n\n14:50: Physician notified of FHR changes. Orders received and implemented per physician order sheet.\n\n15:00: Continuous fetal monitoring continues. Patient tolerating labor well, reporting pain level of 6/10. Encouraging breathing techniques."
