The client's pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement at 07:30 was 198 mg/dL.\n\n<b>Background:</b> The client has a history of Type 2 DM, managed with daily insulin injections. She reports consistent adherence to her prescribed insulin regimen and diet. No recent episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia were reported.\n\n<b>Assessment:</b> At 07:45, the provider ordered 15 units of NPH insulin and 5 units of Regular insulin to be administered subcutaneously once daily at 08:00. The client is alert and oriented, currently sitting in a chair awaiting breakfast.\n\n<b>Recommendation:</b> The nurse is preparing the insulin syringes at the medication cart for administration at 08:00. Verify the insulin doses with a second nurse before administration. Monitor the client's blood glucose levels before breakfast and post-injection to assess the insulin's effectiveness."
