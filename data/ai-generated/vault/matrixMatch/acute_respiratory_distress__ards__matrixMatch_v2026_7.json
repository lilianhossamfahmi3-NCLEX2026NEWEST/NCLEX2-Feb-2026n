This improves oxygenation by reducing intrapulmonary shunting and improving ventilation-perfusion matching.

Increasing FiO2 increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, thereby increasing the driving force for oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries and improving oxygenation. While essential for maintaining adequate oxygen saturation, high FiO2 levels can contribute to oxygen toxicity and lung injury if prolonged, so it's not a lung-protective strategy itself. It does not directly improve ventilation."

        "rationale": "Maintaining a low tidal volume (e.g., 6-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight) is a crucial component of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS. High tidal volumes can cause overdistension of the alveoli, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). By using low tidal volumes, the risk of VILI is reduced. While low tidal volumes can indirectly impact oxygenation and ventilation by preventing further lung damage, the primary purpose is to reduce lung injury."
