        "correct": "Traction safety involves maintaining the proper 'pull' and preventing secondary complications. \n\n*   **(r1) Buck's Traction:** This is skin traction, applying force via tape/boot to the skin. The primary concern is skin breakdown due to pressure. Frequent skin assessments, especially over bony prominences like the heel and popliteal space, are crucial. Booting helps distribute pressure. \n\n*   **(r2) Skeletal Traction:** Pins are surgically inserted into the bone, allowing for heavier weights. The direct bone access creates a risk for osteomyelitis. Meticulous pin site care using aseptic technique is essential to prevent infection. Monitor for signs of infection (purulence, redness, swelling, increased pain, fever). \n\n*   **(r3) Halo Traction:** This stabilizes cervical fractures. In an emergency (e.g., cardiac arrest), the vest may need to be quickly removed to access the chest for CPR. A wrench or screwdriver taped to the vest allows for rapid removal. \n\n*   **(r4) Bryant's Traction:** Used in young children (typically <2 years) with femur fractures or hip dysplasia. The child's legs are suspended vertically, using the child's weight as counter-traction. The buttocks should be slightly elevated off the mattress to ensure proper traction force and alignment.",
