At 14:00, he became increasingly agitated; SpO2 dropped to 88% despite FiO2 60%. Respiratory rate is 28, appearing to fight the vent. Left-sided breath sounds are diminished. We increased propofol per protocol, but restlessness persists. BP is 160/90, HR 110. ABG: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 60. I suspect a possible pneumothorax given the acute respiratory decline and auscultation findings. I recommend a STAT chest X-ray to rule out barotrauma. Respiratory therapy has been notified for immediate assessment and ventilator management review.",

The ABG (pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg) indicates respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, confirming respiratory compromise. Barotrauma occurs when excessive alveolar pressure causes rupture and air leakage into the pleural space. The diminished breath sounds specifically point to the left side as the primary area of concern. A chest x-ray is crucial for confirmation. Prompt intervention, like chest tube insertion, is vital to prevent tension pneumothorax and cardiovascular compromise. The increased agitation is likely due to hypoxemia and discomfort from the pneumothorax.",
