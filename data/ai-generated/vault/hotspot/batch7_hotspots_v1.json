            "correct": "The correct answer is the muscle layer (h1). The Z-track technique is used for IM injections to minimize local skin irritation and staining by sealing the medication deep within the muscle tissue. This is achieved by displacing the skin and subcutaneous tissue laterally before injecting the medication. Once injected, the tissue is released, creating a zig-zag path that prevents the medication from leaking back into the subcutaneous tissue.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** IM injections deposit medication directly into the muscle, which has a rich blood supply, allowing for faster absorption compared to subcutaneous injections. The Z-track method is particularly useful for medications that are irritating to subcutaneous tissue or can cause discoloration. By creating a tortuous path, the medication is trapped within the muscle, reducing the risk of leakage and subsequent irritation or staining.\n\n**SBAR (1400):**\n*   **Situation:** Preparing to administer an IM injection using the Z-track method.\n*   **Background:** The Z-track technique is used to prevent medication leakage into subcutaneous tissue, reducing irritation and staining.\n*   **Assessment:** Selected the muscle layer as the appropriate injection site.\n*   **Recommendation:** Proceed with the IM injection using the Z-track method, ensuring proper technique to deposit the medication into the muscle layer.",
            "incorrect": "Subcutaneous tissue (h2) is the site for subcutaneous injections, such as insulin or heparin. These medications are absorbed more slowly than IM injections. The epidermis (h3) is the outermost layer of the skin and is the target for intradermal injections, such as tuberculin skin tests (PPD). Intradermal injections are used for medications that require slow absorption and a localized reaction.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Subcutaneous tissue has fewer blood vessels than muscle tissue, resulting in slower absorption. Intradermal injections are placed just beneath the epidermis, allowing for a localized immune response. Injecting an IM medication into the subcutaneous tissue can lead to poor absorption and potential irritation, while injecting it into the epidermis would not result in the desired systemic effect.",
