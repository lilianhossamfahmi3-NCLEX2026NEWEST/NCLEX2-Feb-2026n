Pain started approximately 4 hours ago. B: History of osteoarthritis. TKA performed due to chronic pain and limited mobility. PMH includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. No known drug allergies.  Received routine post-operative care. A: Client is alert and oriented. Right lower leg is edematous and tender to palpation. Reports paresthesia in the foot. Dorsalis pedis pulse palpable but diminished compared to the left. Capillary refill is approximately 3 seconds. Vitals stable (see below). Pain is disproportionate to the procedure. R: STAT surgical consult for possible compartment syndrome. Prepare for intracompartmental pressure measurement and potential fasciotomy. Monitor neurovascular status frequently. Hold further opioid administration until further evaluation. Keep extremity at level of the heart. 14:35.",

        "rationale": "Compartment syndrome is a condition in which increased pressure within a limited space compromises the circulation and function of the tissues within that space. In the lower leg, this typically occurs in the anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, or deep posterior compartments. Post-operative edema and bleeding can increase pressure within these compartments. The classic '5 Ps' of compartment syndrome are pain (out of proportion to the injury), paresthesia, pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis. Pain that is unrelieved by analgesics, especially in the setting of recent surgery, should raise suspicion for compartment syndrome. Early identification and intervention (fasciotomy) are critical to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage. The anterior compartment contains muscles that dorsiflex the foot and toes, the lateral compartment everts the foot, and the deep posterior compartment plantarflexes the foot and toes. Compression of nerves in these compartments causes paresthesia.",
