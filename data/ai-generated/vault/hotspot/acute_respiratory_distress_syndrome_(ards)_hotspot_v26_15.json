        "rationale": "ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, leading to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. This results in pulmonary edema and the formation of hyaline membranes, which impair gas exchange. Radiographically, this manifests as bilateral infiltrates, diffuse haziness, and ground-glass opacities, especially in the lower and peripheral lung fields. These findings distinguish ARDS from other pulmonary conditions like pneumonia, which typically presents with lobar consolidation, or pleural effusions, which involve fluid accumulation in the pleural space. The key pathophysiological feature driving these radiographic changes is the inflammatory process causing protein-rich fluid leakage into the alveoli and interstitial spaces.",
        "distractors": [],
        "clinicalPearls": "Early recognition of ARDS radiographic patterns is crucial for timely intervention. Pay attention to the distribution of infiltrates (bilateral vs. lobar) and the presence of ground-glass opacities. Correlate radiographic findings with clinical indicators like hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.",
        "questionTrap": "Be careful not to confuse ARDS with other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as pneumonia or heart failure. Focus on the diffuse and bilateral nature of the infiltrates in ARDS, as well as the presence of ground-glass opacities, to differentiate it from localized consolidation or cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",
