B: Patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He fell at home and was found by his daughter. Initial GCS was 14, now 11. Oxygen saturation initially 98% on room air, now 92%. A: Patient is showing signs of increased ICP. Noted a change in mental status; pupils are now unequal. Vital signs reveal bradycardia and elevated systolic blood pressure. Respiratory pattern is irregular. Planning to perform neurological checks every hour and administer prescribed mannitol per orders. R: Neurosurgeon has been notified and is on the way to assess. Continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status closely. Prepare for possible intubation and transfer to ICU. Will update you with any changes. Family is at bedside and anxious.

        "distractorRationale": {
            "Incorrect Regions": "Areas not directly related to physical assessment findings associated with Cushing's Triad.",
            "Explanation": "Cushing's Triad specifically affects vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory pattern) which are assessed through head, eyes and chest. Other areas of the body are not directly indicative of Cushing's Triad."
        },
        "rationale": "Cushing's Triad is a set of three clinical manifestations indicating increased intracranial pressure (ICP): bradycardia (decreased heart rate), hypertension (increased systolic blood pressure with widening pulse pressure), and irregular respirations (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes). This triad signifies the brain's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of rising ICP. Increased ICP can lead to compression of the brainstem, affecting the vasomotor center and vagus nerve, hence causing the observed vital sign changes. The widening pulse pressure results from increased systolic pressure coupled with decreased or unchanged diastolic pressure. Irregular respirations occur due to the pressure on the respiratory centers in the brainstem. These manifestations are critical indicators for prompt intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Recognizing Cushing's Triad is critical for nurses to promptly identify increased ICP and initiate appropriate interventions. Early detection and management can significantly improve patient outcomes. Accurate and timely neurological assessments are essential in patients at risk for increased ICP. Report any findings of Cushing's Triad to the physician immediately.",
        "questionTrap": "Many students mistake hypertension alone as indicative of a problem, but the key is the *widening pulse pressure* coupled with bradycardia and irregular respirations. Also, be aware of the changing values in the EHR, noting trends rather than isolated data points. Assess ALL areas, but only mark the areas assciated with Cushing's Triad.",
        "mnemonic": "Cushing's Triad: BHI - Bradycardia, Hypertension, Irregular Respirations."
