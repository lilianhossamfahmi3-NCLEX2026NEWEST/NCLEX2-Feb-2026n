Background: He has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. His daughter found him after the fall. Initial GCS was 14, now 11. Oxygen saturation initially 98% on room air, now 92%. Assessment: Mr. Johnson shows signs of increased ICP, including a change in mental status and unequal pupils. Vital signs reveal bradycardia (HR 50 bpm) and elevated systolic blood pressure (180/60 mmHg). Respiratory pattern is irregular (10 bpm). Recommendation: Neurosurgeon has been notified and is en route. Continue hourly neurological checks and administer prescribed mannitol per orders. Prepare for possible intubation and transfer to ICU. Update family and provide emotional support.",

            "correct": "Cushing's Triad is a classic set of three clinical manifestations indicating increased intracranial pressure (ICP): bradycardia (decreased heart rate), hypertension (increased systolic blood pressure with widening pulse pressure), and irregular respirations (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes). This triad signifies the brain's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of rising ICP. Increased ICP can lead to compression of the brainstem, affecting the vasomotor center and vagus nerve, hence causing the observed vital sign changes. The widening pulse pressure results from increased systolic pressure coupled with decreased or unchanged diastolic pressure. Irregular respirations occur due to the pressure on the respiratory centers in the brainstem. These manifestations are critical indicators for prompt intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
