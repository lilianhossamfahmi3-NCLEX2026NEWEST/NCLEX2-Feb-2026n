Background: Ms. Vance has a history of well-controlled gestational hypertension. However, today her blood pressure is significantly elevated. Assessment: Current BP is 170/110 mmHg. She reports decreased fetal movement. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with 2 beats of clonus. Labs are pending. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows a baseline of 110 bpm with minimal variability. Patient reports increasing epigastric pain. Recommendation: Stat labs, Magnesium Sulfate infusion, and immediate evaluation for possible delivery. Consider HELLP syndrome. Strict I/O monitoring is essential. Prepare for potential seizure activity and respiratory depression.",

Epigastric pain, indicated by liver tenderness, results from hepatic swelling and potential hemorrhage. Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH) confirm liver dysfunction. Low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Assessing for edema helps evaluate fluid retention and potential end-organ damage. Hyperreflexia, particularly clonus, indicates central nervous system irritability due to cerebral edema and increases the risk of seizures. These assessments guide immediate interventions, including magnesium sulfate administration to prevent seizures and potential delivery to resolve the underlying pathophysiology.",
