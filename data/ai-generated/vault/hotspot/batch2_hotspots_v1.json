Palpation of McBurney's point elicits intense, localized tenderness in patients with acute appendicitis. This tenderness results from inflammation of the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix. The inflammatory process is initiated by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, often by a fecalith, leading to increased intraluminal pressure, bacterial proliferation, and subsequent inflammation and ischemia of the appendiceal wall. If left untreated, this can progress to perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.",
