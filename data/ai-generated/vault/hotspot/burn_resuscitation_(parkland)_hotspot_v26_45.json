Initial assessment showed singed nasal hairs, soot in sputum, and circumferential burns on both arms and the anterior trunk.\n**Assessment:** At 09:30: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 28, SpO2 94% on 100% FiO2 via NRB. Patient is alert but anxious. Moderate pain reported. Urine output is currently minimal. Auscultation reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally.\n**Recommendation:** Initiate fluid resuscitation per Parkland formula. Monitor urine output, vital signs, and respiratory status closely. Consider pain management and wound care. Consult burn specialist.",
