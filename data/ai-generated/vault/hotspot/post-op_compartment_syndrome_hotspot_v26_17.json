      "SBAR": "**Situation:** Mr. Johnson, 67-year-old male, post-operative day 0 following a left tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) performed at 10:00 today. He reports increasing pain in his left lower leg that is unresponsive to the prescribed opioid analgesic.\n**Background:** Mr. Johnson has a history of osteoarthritis in both knees. He was admitted for a TPLO to address persistent pain and instability in his left knee. Pre-operative assessment was within normal limits. He received 2mg hydromorphone IV at 14:00 for pain rated 6/10.\n**Assessment:** Current assessment at 15:30 reveals the patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs: BP 152/94 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. Left lower leg is edematous and feels firm to palpation. Distal pulses are present but diminished compared to the right leg. Patient reports pain as 9/10 in the left lower leg, described as a deep, throbbing ache. Passive dorsiflexion of the foot elicits intense pain in the calf. Capillary refill is approximately 3 seconds in the left foot. Sensation to light touch is intact.\n**Recommendation:** I am concerned about the possibility of acute compartment syndrome in the left lower leg. I recommend immediate surgical consult for fasciotomy consideration.",

      "correct": "Compartment syndrome is a condition that occurs when swelling and increased pressure within a limited space (compartment) press on and compromise the function of blood vessels, nerves, and/or tendons within that space. In Mr. Johnson's case, the anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, and deep posterior compartments of the lower leg are at risk following a TPLO. The SBAR indicates increased pain, edema, firmness of the calf, diminished pulses, and pain with passive dorsiflexion (a classic sign). These findings suggest increased pressure within these compartments. The Achilles tendon and dorsum of the foot, while important to assess generally, are not directly related to the muscle compartments of the lower leg that are most susceptible in this scenario.",
