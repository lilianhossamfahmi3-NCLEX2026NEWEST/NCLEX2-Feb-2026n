            "SBAR": "**Situation:** Mr. Johnson, a 67-year-old male, is post-operative day 0 following a left tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) performed at 10:00 today. He reports increasing pain in his left lower leg, which is unresponsive to prescribed opioid analgesics.\n**Background:** Mr. Johnson has a history of osteoarthritis in both knees and was admitted for a TPLO to address persistent pain and instability in his left knee. Pre-operative assessment was within normal limits. He received hydromorphone 2mg IV at 14:00 for pain rated 6/10.\n**Assessment:** Current assessment at 15:30 reveals the patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs: BP 152/94 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air, Temp 37.2°C. The left lower leg is edematous and feels firm to palpation. Distal pulses are present but diminished compared to the right leg. The patient reports pain as 9/10 in the left lower leg, described as a deep, throbbing ache. Passive dorsiflexion of the foot elicits intense pain in the calf. Capillary refill is approximately 3 seconds in the left foot. Sensation to light touch is intact.\n**Recommendation:** I am concerned about acute compartment syndrome in the left lower leg. I recommend an immediate surgical consult for possible fasciotomy.",
