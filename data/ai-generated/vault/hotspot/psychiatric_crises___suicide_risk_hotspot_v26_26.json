He has been increasingly withdrawn and expressed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness over the past few weeks. He recently lost his job and broke up with his partner. A: Client is currently alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but exhibits significant anxiety and sadness. He denies current suicidal ideation but admits to having passive thoughts of death. He is medically stable after treatment for the acetaminophen overdose. R: Continue monitoring for suicidal ideation, provide supportive counseling, and administer prescribed psychiatric medications.

Wrist cuts and arm scratches are common indicators of self-inflicted injuries and should be carefully evaluated for depth, recentness, and potential infection. Neck marks may suggest a prior attempt at strangulation or hanging, requiring immediate attention and documentation. While assessing the abdomen for scars and noting pupil dilation are part of a general physical exam, they are less directly indicative of the immediate suicide risk in this scenario. The client's history of acetaminophen overdose necessitates a thorough exam, but the visible signs of self-harm provide more immediate insights into the client's current state and require focused intervention.",
