This requires immediate intervention to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart. Failure to address ST elevation can lead to irreversible myocardial damage and further complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure."

While not as immediately critical as ST elevation, it indicates a compromised blood supply to the myocardium and the potential for worsening ischemia. It warrants prompt assessment and potential intervention to prevent further damage."

This can lead to hemodynamic instability and increased risk of arrhythmias. Evaluation of the QRS complex is crucial for identifying conduction abnormalities and guiding appropriate treatment strategies."

Atrial fibrillation or flutter may be present, but the immediate concern is myocardial damage. A prolonged PR interval, while indicative of a first-degree AV block, is generally not life-threatening in the acute phase of MI. The immediate threat is myocardial ischemia and infarction.",

Troponin level is elevated. Assessment: Currently reporting ongoing chest pain, rated 6/10. Vital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows persistent ST-segment elevation. Recommendation: Requesting immediate cardiology consult and consideration for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Pain medication PRN.

Ensure adequate pain management and oxygenation.",
