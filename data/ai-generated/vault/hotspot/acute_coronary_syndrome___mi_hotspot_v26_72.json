This requires immediate intervention, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy, to restore blood flow and prevent irreversible myocardial damage. Failure to address ST elevation promptly can lead to significant complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and death. The extent and location of ST elevation help determine the affected area of the heart. ClinicalPearl: ST elevation >1mm in two contiguous limb leads or >2mm in two contiguous precordial leads is significant."

While not as immediately critical as ST elevation, it indicates a compromised blood supply to the myocardium and the potential for worsening ischemia or infarction. Prompt assessment, including serial ECGs and cardiac enzyme monitoring, is warranted to prevent further damage. QuestionTrap: Isolated T-wave inversions can be normal variants, but in the context of chest pain and other ECG changes, they are highly concerning. Mnemonic: Think of 'T' for Trouble; inverted T waves signal myocardial trouble."

In the setting of acute MI, a new BBB can signify significant myocardial damage and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Evaluation of the QRS complex is crucial for identifying conduction abnormalities and guiding appropriate treatment strategies, including possible temporary pacing. ClinicalPearl: A new left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the setting of chest pain is considered a STEMI equivalent and requires immediate reperfusion therapy."

A prolonged PR interval, while indicative of a first-degree AV block, is generally not life-threatening in the acute phase of MI. The immediate threat is myocardial ischemia and infarction, as indicated by ST elevation, T-wave inversion, and QRS complex widening.",

Background: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the ED at 12:00 with substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. His initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I level is elevated at 1.8 ng/mL. Assessment: Mr. Johnson reports ongoing chest pain, rated 6/10. His vital signs are: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Current ECG shows persistent ST-segment elevation. Recommendation: Requesting immediate cardiology consult for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Continue pain management with morphine PRN. Maintain continuous ECG monitoring. Repeat troponin levels in 3 hours. Consider oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO2 >95%.",

Students may also misinterpret isolated T-wave inversions as benign.",
