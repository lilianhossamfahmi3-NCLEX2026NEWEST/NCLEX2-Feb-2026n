            "optionA": "Correct. Expressing feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness is a critical indicator of suicidal ideation. These feelings can intensify the patient's desire to end their life. Immediate intervention, including a thorough suicide risk assessment and implementation of safety measures, is essential to protect the patient.",
            "optionB": "Incorrect. While a structured daily routine is generally beneficial for mental health, it does not indicate an immediate crisis. It's a supportive measure, but not a sign of escalating suicide risk. Focusing solely on this aspect could lead to overlooking more critical warning signs.",
            "optionC": "Correct. Social isolation and withdrawal are significant risk factors for suicide, especially post-attempt. Isolation exacerbates feelings of loneliness and reduces the likelihood of seeking help. Immediate intervention to connect the patient with support systems and therapeutic engagement is crucial.",
            "optionD": "Incorrect. Compliance with medication is positive, but it doesn't negate the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment. Antidepressants can take time to be effective, and the patient may still be at risk. Relying solely on medication adherence can lead to a false sense of security.",
            "optionE": "Correct. A history of previous suicide attempts is one of the strongest predictors of future attempts. This indicates a pattern of suicidal behavior and a higher likelihood of recurrence. Immediate attention and heightened vigilance are necessary to prevent another attempt.",
            "optionF": "Incorrect. Difficulty falling asleep, in isolation, is less critical than direct expressions of suicidal ideation or a history of attempts. While sleep disturbances can contribute to mental health issues, they are not as immediately indicative of suicide risk as other factors. Further assessment is warranted, but it's not the priority in this context."

He reports feeling overwhelmed due to recent job loss and a relationship breakup. B: He has a history of major depressive disorder, treated with sertraline 100mg daily. He had a previous suicide attempt 5 years ago. A: The patient is alert and oriented but exhibits distress, including tearfulness, social withdrawal, and hopelessness ('What's the point of going on?'). He denies current suicidal ideation but expresses worthlessness and isolation. Vitals: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F. Assessed as high suicide risk. R: I recommend an immediate psychiatric evaluation, continuous monitoring, and implementation of suicide precautions. Consult social work for resource assessment and family support. Continue medication as prescribed, monitoring for side effects. Engage in therapeutic communication and encourage group therapy participation. Ensure strict adherence to safety protocols. Evaluate the need for medication adjustment based on mood and treatment response. Monitor sleep patterns.",

The patient's statement 'What's the point of going on?' is a key indicator that should not be dismissed, even if the patient denies current suicidal ideation. Prioritize indicators of immediate risk over routine data.",
