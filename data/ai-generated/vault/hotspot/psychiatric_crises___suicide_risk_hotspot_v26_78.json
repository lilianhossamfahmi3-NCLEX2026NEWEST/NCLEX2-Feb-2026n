            "optionA": "Correct. The patient expressing feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness is a significant indicator of suicidal ideation and requires immediate intervention to assess suicide risk and implement safety measures.",
            "optionB": "Incorrect. A structured daily routine, while beneficial for overall mental health, does not necessarily indicate an immediate crisis requiring intervention. It is a supportive measure but not a red flag.",
            "optionC": "Correct. Social isolation, especially after a suicide attempt, is a critical risk factor. It increases feelings of loneliness and reduces the likelihood of seeking help. Immediate intervention is needed to connect the patient with support systems.",
            "optionD": "Incorrect. Compliance with prescribed medication, even if recent, does not negate the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment of suicide risk. Medication adherence is positive, but not a reason to ignore other warning signs.",
            "optionE": "Correct. A history of previous suicide attempts significantly increases the risk of future attempts. This is a critical piece of information that demands immediate attention and heightened vigilance.",
            "optionF": "Incorrect. While it is important to monitor sleep patterns, reporting difficulty falling asleep, in isolation, is less critical than direct expressions of suicidal ideation or history of attempts. It warrants further assessment but not necessarily immediate intervention in the context of other more pressing issues."

B: History of major depressive disorder, treated with sertraline 100mg daily. Previous suicide attempt 5 years ago. A: Patient is currently alert and oriented, but exhibiting signs of distress including tearfulness, social withdrawal, and statements of hopelessness ('What's the point of going on?'). Denies current suicidal ideation but expresses feelings of worthlessness and isolation. Vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 98.6°F. Assessed as high suicide risk. R: Recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation, continuous monitoring, implement suicide precautions. Consult social work for resource assessment and family support. Continue medication as prescribed and monitor for side effects. Engage patient in therapeutic communication and encourage participation in group therapy. Ensure safety protocols are followed meticulously. Evaluate need for adjustment of medication regimen based on patient's ongoing mood and response to treatment. Monitor sleep patterns.",

Protective factors, such as social support and coping skills, should be identified and strengthened. Always prioritize patient safety and involve a multidisciplinary team in the care plan.",
        "questionTrap": "Students often focus solely on the medication adherence as a sign of improvement and may overlook critical subjective data like hopelessness and social isolation, both of which elevate suicide risk. The patient's statement 'What's the point of going on?' is a key indicator that should not be dismissed, even if the patient denies current suicidal ideation. Prioritize indicators of immediate risk over routine data.",
