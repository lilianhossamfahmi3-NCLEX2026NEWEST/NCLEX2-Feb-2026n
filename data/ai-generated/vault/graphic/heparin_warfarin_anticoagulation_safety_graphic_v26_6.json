Vital signs: BP 130/80, HR 88 and irregular, RR 16, Temp 37.0°C. INR today is 1.3. No signs of active bleeding. Heparin was last administered at 08:00. Pt also takes metoprolol and lisinopril daily. Recommendation: INR is subtherapeutic, consider increasing warfarin dose. Monitor for signs of bleeding, especially given concurrent heparin and warfarin therapy. Repeat INR tomorrow morning. Continue current heparin regimen until INR is therapeutic.",

Heparin provides immediate anticoagulation while warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. An INR of 1.3 indicates that the warfarin is not yet providing adequate anticoagulation, increasing the risk of clot formation, especially given the client's history of DVT and atrial fibrillation. Contacting the provider to increase the warfarin dose is necessary to achieve a therapeutic INR and reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications. Monitoring for bleeding is crucial due to the synergistic effects of heparin and warfarin. Holding heparin may be necessary if signs of bleeding occur. Vitamin K is not immediately indicated, as it would reverse the effects of warfarin and is typically reserved for cases of significant over-anticoagulation or bleeding. Reassuring the patient that the INR will increase on its own is incorrect, as intervention is likely needed to adjust the warfarin dosage.",
