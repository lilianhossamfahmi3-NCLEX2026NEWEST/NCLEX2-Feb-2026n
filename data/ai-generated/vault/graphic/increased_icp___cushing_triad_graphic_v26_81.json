Noted one episode of vomiting at 06:30. Vital signs at 06:00: HR 60 bpm, BP 160/90 mmHg, RR 14 breaths/min. The 07:00 vitals are concerning. Recommendation: I'm concerned about increased ICP.

Hypertension with widening pulse pressure: The body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing systemic blood pressure. The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures widens. Irregular respirations: Increased ICP affects the brainstem, leading to irregular breathing patterns like Cheyne-Stokes or Biot's respirations.
