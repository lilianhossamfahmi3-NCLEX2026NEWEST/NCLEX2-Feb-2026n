Background: Admitted yesterday for observation after a fall. Initial GCS was 15, now 13. Assessment: Patient is increasingly lethargic and reports a severe headache. Noted one episode of vomiting. Vital signs at 06:00: HR 60, BP 160/90, RR 14. The 07:00 vitals are concerning. Recommendation: I'm concerned about increased ICP. Requesting immediate evaluation by the neuro team and orders for potential interventions. Consider STAT CT scan and medication orders for ICP management.",

These signs include: Bradycardia (decreased heart rate): Increased ICP can compress the vasomotor center in the medulla oblongata, leading to a reflex bradycardia. Hypertension with widening pulse pressure: The body attempts to maintain cerebral perfusion by increasing systemic blood pressure. The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures widens. Irregular respirations: Increased ICP affects the brainstem, leading to irregular breathing patterns like Cheyne-Stokes or Biot's respirations. Recognizing these signs is critical for early intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
