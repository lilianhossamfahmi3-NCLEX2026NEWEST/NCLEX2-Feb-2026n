GH stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes appositional bone growth (growth in thickness and width). This leads to the characteristic coarsening of facial bones and enlargement of hands and feet. The client's headache and visual changes are a direct result of the pituitary tumor's mass effect, compressing surrounding brain tissue and the optic chiasm, which classically causes bitemporal hemianopsia (tunnel vision)."

The underlying pathophysiology is chronic autoimmune synovitis, primarily at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Persistent inflammation leads to the formation of pannus—an aggressive, invasive granulation tissue—which erodes articular cartilage, subchondral bone, and ligaments. This destruction weakens the joint capsule and collateral ligaments, causing joint instability and subluxation (partial dislocation). The natural ulnar pull of the extensor tendons, now unopposed by the damaged ligaments, causes the fingers to 'drift' toward the ulnar side of the hand."

The pathophysiology involves the progressive loss of articular cartilage and subsequent osteophyte (bone spur) formation. While OA can cause significant hand deformities, they are different in nature. Characteristic OA findings include Heberden's nodes (at the distal interphalangeal joints) and Bouchard's nodes (at the proximal interphalangeal joints). OA does not cause the widespread synovial inflammation and ligamentous destruction required to produce the joint subluxation and subsequent ulnar drift seen in RA."

While chronic rigidity can lead to contractures, Parkinson's does not involve the primary inflammatory joint destruction that causes ulnar drift."

While severe, chronic spasticity in MS can lead to muscle imbalances and joint contractures over time, it does not cause the specific MCP joint erosion and ligamentous laxity that defines the ulnar drift deformity.
