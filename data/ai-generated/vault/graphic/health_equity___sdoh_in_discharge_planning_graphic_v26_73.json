Addressing financial concerns via a social worker referral is paramount as it affects access to medications, food, and housing. Arranging for Meals on Wheels directly addresses food insecurity, which is a significant SDOH factor. Home health visits are essential for medication reconciliation and monitoring adherence, especially with complex medication regimens. Connecting the client with transportation ensures they can attend follow-up appointments, preventing delays in care. Education on daily weights and symptoms is always vital but less impactful if the client cannot afford medications or healthy food.",
