This creates a high total gas flow with a precise, predictable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). For a client with COPD and chronic CO2 retention, the primary respiratory drive may have shifted from hypercapnia to hypoxemia. Administering excessively high or variable FiO2 can over-correct hypoxemia, blunt this hypoxic drive, and worsen ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. This leads to increased CO2 retention (hypercapnia) and subsequent respiratory acidosis. The Venturi mask is the ideal device because it allows for the precise titration of FiO2 to maintain a target SpO2 (typically 88-92%) without risking hypercapnic respiratory failure."

A simple mask delivers an estimated FiO2 of 35-50% at flow rates of 5-8 L/min and is sufficient for this client's needs without the complexity of a Venturi system."

A client with severe hypoxemia requiring nearly 100% FiO2 needs a non-rebreather mask.

This ensures the delivered FiO2 remains constant regardless of the client's breathing pattern. However, it does not deliver a high FiO2. A non-rebreather mask is a high-FiO2 device but is technically a low-flow system because the device flow rate does not meet the total inspiratory demand, requiring the client to draw from the reservoir bag.",
