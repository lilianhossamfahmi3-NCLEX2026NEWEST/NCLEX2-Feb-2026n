        "content": "Incorrect. At 4 months, motor control is dominated by primitive reflexes. The palmar grasp reflex is fading, but the infant's grasp is still reflexive and uncoordinated, typically involving the whole hand (a mitten grasp). The requisite neuromuscular maturation and myelination of corticospinal tracts for isolating the thumb and index finger have not yet occurred. **Pathophysiology:** The corticospinal tract is responsible for voluntary motor control. Myelination, the process of coating nerve fibers with myelin, increases the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse transmission. Incomplete myelination in early infancy limits fine motor control."

        "optionId": "b",
        "content": "Incorrect. At 6 months, an infant is developing a 'raking grasp,' using the ulnar side of the hand and fingers like a rake to pull objects closer. While voluntary grasping is present, the fine motor control and cortical development needed to isolate and oppose the thumb and index finger for a pincer grasp are still immature. Gross motor skills, such as sitting with support, are the primary focus at this stage. **Pathophysiology:** The development of fine motor skills follows a cephalocaudal (head-to-toe) and proximodistal (center-to-periphery) pattern. Gross motor skills involving larger muscle groups develop before fine motor skills involving smaller muscles of the hands and fingers."

        "optionId": "c",
        "content": "Correct. At approximately 9 months, the myelination of corticospinal tracts has progressed sufficiently to allow for fine, voluntary motor control of individual digits. This neurological maturation enables the infant to oppose the thumb and index finger (a 'neat' pincer grasp), a critical step in developing prehension skills and hand-eye coordination. This skill replaces the less precise 'raking' grasp of earlier months. **Pathophysiology:** The pincer grasp requires the coordinated action of multiple muscles in the hand and fingers, controlled by the motor cortex. The ability to isolate and control these muscles is dependent on the maturation of the nervous system and the development of neural pathways."

        "optionId": "d",
        "content": "Incorrect. While a 12-month-old infant has a well-established pincer grasp, this is not the minimum age for its emergence. By 12 months, this skill is typically mastered and being refined for more complex tasks like turning pages in a book or placing objects into a container. Selecting this option overlooks the earlier achievement of this key developmental milestone. **Pathophysiology:** The refinement of the pincer grasp involves further development of hand-eye coordination and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). This allows the infant to perform increasingly precise and coordinated movements."
