He has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and COPD.\n\n**B:** He presented with severe shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Initial assessment revealed crackles bilaterally and elevated BNP. He was started on oxygen via nasal cannula at 4L/min and IV furosemide 40mg.\n\n**A:** Currently, he is complaining of persistent shortness of breath. His arterial line shows a MAP of 68 mmHg. CVP is elevated. He received another dose of furosemide 20mg IV at 06:00. Urine output has been minimal (30 mL since midnight). Arterial blood gas is pending. Respiratory rate is 28 and labored. Oxygen saturation is 91% on 4L nasal cannula. He is anxious and restless.\n\n**R:** I recommend assessing his arterial blood gas results as soon as available. Consider increasing oxygen support, potentially to BiPAP. Evaluate the need for further diuresis or alternative therapies such as vasodilators. Notify the physician if his MAP continues to decline or if his respiratory status worsens.",
