His history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and COPD.\n\n**B:** He presented with severe shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Initial assessment showed bilateral crackles and elevated BNP. Oxygen was started via nasal cannula at 4L/min, and IV furosemide 40mg was administered.\n\n**A:** He continues to complain of shortness of breath. His arterial line shows a MAP of 68 mmHg, and his CVP is elevated. He received another furosemide 20mg IV at 06:00, but urine output has been minimal (30 mL since midnight). Pending arterial blood gas. Respiratory rate is 28 and labored. Oxygen saturation is 91% on 4L nasal cannula. He is anxious and restless.\n\n**R:** I recommend reviewing the arterial blood gas results when available. Consider increasing oxygen support, possibly to BiPAP. Evaluate the need for further diuresis or vasodilators. Notify the physician if his MAP declines further or his respiratory status worsens.",
