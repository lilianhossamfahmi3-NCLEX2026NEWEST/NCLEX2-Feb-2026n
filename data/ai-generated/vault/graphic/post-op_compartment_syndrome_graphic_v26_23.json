He reports severe pain in his right lower leg, rated 9/10, despite hydromorphone 2mg IV at 17:00. Dressing is dry/intact, but right calf is tense/swollen. Pulses are present but diminished compared to the left leg. He's increasingly anxious/agitated. Vitals at 17:30: BP 140/90, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 97% on 2L NC. I'm concerned about possible compartment syndrome. Recommend immediate assessment and possible fasciotomy. I'll continue to monitor vitals and neurovascular status closely and administer oxygen as needed.",
