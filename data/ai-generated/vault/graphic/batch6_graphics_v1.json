This specific pattern of bruising results from a fracture at the base of the skull (basilar skull fracture), particularly involving the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The fracture tears small arteries and veins within the bone and meninges, leading to extravasation of blood. The blood tracks along the path of the posterior auricular artery, dissecting through fascial planes to the subcutaneous tissue over the mastoid process. This sign is typically delayed, appearing 24-48 hours post-injury. Its presence signifies a high-risk injury with potential for dural tears, leading to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and a significant risk for meningitis."

It does not directly cause external ecchymosis over the mastoid process.

The pathophysiology involves a fracture line crossing into the sphenoid or ethmoid sinuses, tearing the underlying dura mater. This allows blood from epidural or subdural hematomas to track along fascial planes from the cranial vault into the loose areolar tissue surrounding the orbits. This process is slow, which is why the sign often appears 12-72 hours after the initial injury."

This pressure fractures the thin orbital floor or medial wall. The resulting ecchymosis is caused by direct hemorrhage from damaged orbital vessels, is usually unilateral, and is often accompanied by diplopia on upward gaze due to entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. The bleeding source is local, not intracranial."

While this can cause significant periorbital swelling and bruising due to the rich vascular supply of the face, the ecchymosis is typically centered over the nasal bridge and is a direct result of soft tissue and periosteal bleeding at the fracture site. It does not typically present as the distinct, isolated, bilateral rings seen in the image, which are caused by blood seeping from the cranium."

The pathophysiology involves a neurometabolic cascade with ionic shifts and neurotransmitter release, leading to neuronal dysfunction. It does not involve fractures or significant hemorrhage. Therefore, a concussion would not produce external signs of bleeding like periorbital ecchymosis. Its symptoms are neurologic (e.g., confusion, amnesia, headache)."

The image displays asterixis, a form of negative myoclonus characterized by a brief, intermittent loss of postural muscle tone, resulting in a 'flapping' motion when the wrists are extended. This is a hallmark sign of hepatic encephalopathy. In hepatic encephalopathy, the failing liver cannot effectively convert ammonia (a byproduct of protein catabolism) into urea. The neurotoxic ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, leading to an overproduction of glutamine, osmotic shifts, astrocyte swelling, and impaired neurotransmission, particularly in motor pathways."
