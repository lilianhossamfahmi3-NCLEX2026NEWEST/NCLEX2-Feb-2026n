She's a 78-year-old female admitted yesterday at 16:00 for a hip fracture repair following a fall at home. Her pain is currently a 6/10 despite PRN analgesics. She's oriented to person and place, but intermittently confused regarding time. Her vital signs are stable: BP 130/80, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. She reports feeling anxious and is repeatedly asking about the security of her personal information within the hospital's electronic systems. She has a history of anxiety and expresses significant concern about potential data breaches and misuse of her health records, particularly regarding genetic information and family history due to recent media coverage of healthcare data breaches. She has voiced concerns about her wearable fitness tracker's data being linked to her EHR without her consent.",
