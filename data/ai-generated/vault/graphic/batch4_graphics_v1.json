This leads to vasodilation, erythema, and edema in a characteristic distribution across the cheeks and nose, notably sparing the nasolabial folds. The client's concurrent systemic symptoms of fatigue and arthralgia are also caused by this widespread immune complex deposition and inflammation in other body tissues."
