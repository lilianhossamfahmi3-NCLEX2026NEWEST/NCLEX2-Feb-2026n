These factors promote vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and proliferation of connective tissue and vasculature in the distal digits, resulting in the characteristic clubbed appearance. Megakaryocytes, bypassing the pulmonary circulation due to shunting, may also contribute by releasing growth factors in the fingertips. The Schamroth sign, where the diamond-shaped window disappears when the dorsal surfaces of the distal phalanges are opposed, is a key diagnostic indicator."

The client's reported fatigue and joint pain are also common systemic symptoms associated with SLE, resulting from widespread inflammation and immune complex deposition in various tissues. The pathophysiology involves a Type III hypersensitivity reaction where autoantibodies form immune complexes with nuclear antigens, leading to complement activation and tissue damage. Early diagnosis and management of SLE are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. Monitor for signs of renal involvement (proteinuria, elevated creatinine), cardiac complications (pericarditis, myocarditis), and neurological manifestations (seizures, cognitive dysfunction)."

The pathophysiology involves bacterial proliferation and toxin release, leading to a localized inflammatory response.

The rash is consistent with early localized Lyme disease.\n\n**Assessment (0805):** Erythema Migrans is the pathognomonic rash of early localized Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete *Borrelia burgdorferi*. This indicates a bacterial infection requiring antibiotic treatment.\n\n**Recommendation (0810):** Anticipate a prescription for Doxycycline. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. This bacteriostatic action stops the proliferation of *Borrelia*, allowing the host's immune system to eradicate the systemic infection, preventing progression to later stages involving the joints, heart, and nervous system. Early treatment with Doxycycline is crucial to prevent long-term complications. Monitor for improvement in rash and resolution of any other symptoms. Educate the client on completing the full course of antibiotics and preventative measures against future tick bites.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease are critical to prevent progression to disseminated disease.

Current medications include furosemide and lisinopril.\nAssessment: At 1400, assessment reveals 3+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity, with a 6mm indentation lasting several seconds. Skin is intact, without signs of breakdown. Client reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion. Weight gain of 2 kg since last clinic visit.\nRecommendation: Recommend reassessment of diuretic dosage and potential adjustment of heart failure medications. Consider further evaluation of renal function. Elevate legs when sitting. Monitor intake and output closely. Notify provider of any worsening symptoms."
