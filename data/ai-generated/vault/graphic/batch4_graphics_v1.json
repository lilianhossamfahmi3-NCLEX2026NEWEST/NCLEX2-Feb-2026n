The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed that hypoxia triggers the release of growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These factors promote vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and proliferation of connective tissue and vasculature in the distal digits, resulting in the characteristic clubbed appearance. Megakaryocytes, bypassing the pulmonary circulation due to shunting, may also contribute by releasing growth factors in the fingertips. The Schamroth sign, where the diamond-shaped window disappears when the dorsal surfaces of the distal phalanges are opposed, is a key diagnostic indicator. "

The pathophysiology involves a Type III hypersensitivity reaction where autoantibodies form immune complexes with nuclear antigens. These complexes deposit in the microvasculature of the skin, activating the complement system and triggering an inflammatory cascade. This leads to vasodilation, erythema, and edema in a characteristic distribution across the cheeks and nose, notably sparing the nasolabial folds. The client's concurrent systemic symptoms of fatigue and arthralgia are also caused by this widespread immune complex deposition and inflammation in other body tissues.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early diagnosis and management of SLE are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. Monitor for signs of renal involvement (proteinuria, elevated creatinine), cardiac complications (pericarditis, myocarditis), and neurological manifestations (seizures, cognitive dysfunction)."

Pathophysiologically, this severe hypertrophy significantly reduces the airway's cross-sectional area, dramatically increasing airway resistance. This turbulent airflow can lead to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). During sleep, decreased pharyngeal muscle tone allows the tonsils to fully obstruct the airway, causing apnea, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia. Chronic OSA can result in pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal cardiac strain, and neurocognitive deficits due to intermittent hypoxemia. The increased work of breathing can also lead to respiratory muscle fatigue.",
