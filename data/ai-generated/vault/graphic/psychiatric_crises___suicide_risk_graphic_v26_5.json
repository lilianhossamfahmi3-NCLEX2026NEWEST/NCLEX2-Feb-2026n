The patient overdosed on acetaminophen and was found by his roommate. Upon admission at 08:00, the patient is tearful, agitated, and expresses feelings of hopelessness. The nurse is reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR) and needs to prioritize interventions based on the assessment findings.
