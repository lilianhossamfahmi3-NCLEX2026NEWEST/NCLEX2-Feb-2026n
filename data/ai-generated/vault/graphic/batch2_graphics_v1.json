This score may result from incorrectly assessing the verbal response as 'Inappropriate words' (3) instead of 'Confused' (4) and the motor response as 'Withdraws from pain' (4) instead of 'Localizes to pain' (5).

Withdrawal from pain is a reflexive movement away from the stimulus, indicating a less complex neurological response.",

The total GCS score is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. This score indicates a moderate brain injury. The client's ability to localize pain signifies that the corticospinal tracts are functional enough to process the location of a noxious stimulus and generate a purposeful motor action to remove it.

This score may result from incorrectly assessing the eye-opening response as 'Spontaneous' (4) instead of 'To verbal command' (3). Spontaneous eye-opening indicates that the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in the brainstem is maintaining wakefulness without external stimuli. The client requires a verbal command to activate the ARAS for arousal, signifying a lower level of brainstem and cortical function.",

Confusing 'Localizes pain' (a purposeful, cortically-driven movement to the stimulus) with 'Withdraws from pain' (a reflexive, non-specific movement away from the stimulus) is a frequent error. This distinction is crucial as it separates a purposeful brain response from a more primitive one, which has significant prognostic implications.",
