His BP is 80/40, HR is 130, RR is 32, and SpO2 is 88% on 6L nasal cannula. He's confused and lethargic. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and COPD. He was started on IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics per protocol, but his condition is worsening. The cultures are pending. He also has an indwelling urinary catheter with cloudy urine. His lactate is elevated at 4.5 mmol/L. I'm concerned he's developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). I need you to evaluate him urgently and consider vasopressors and advanced respiratory support. He's not responding adequately to the current treatment. Please review his labs and vitals in the EHR. He needs immediate attention.",
