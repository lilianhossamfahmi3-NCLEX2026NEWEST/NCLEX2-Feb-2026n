The AV node is bombarded with impulses and allows them to pass to the ventricles intermittently, causing the irregular ventricular response. The client's lightheadedness is a direct consequence of reduced cardiac output from the loss of 'atrial kick' and shortened ventricular filling time, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion."

                "content": "A 12 mm induration is a positive result for a healthcare worker. This interpretation is based on risk stratification for TB exposure. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** The Mantoux test relies on a Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction. When tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) is injected intradermally in a previously sensitized person, memory T-lymphocytes recognize the antigens. Over 48-72 hours, these T-cells proliferate and release cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma), which recruit macrophages and other inflammatory cells to the site. This cellular infiltrate, combined with localized edema and fibrin deposition, creates a palpable, hardened area known as induration. \n\n**Clinical Rationale:** Healthcare workers are considered a moderate-risk group due to potential occupational exposure. For this group, an induration of ≥10 mm is the threshold for a positive result. Since 12 mm exceeds 10 mm, it signifies a significant immune response to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* antigens. The next step is a clinical evaluation, including a chest X-ray and symptom assessment, to differentiate between latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease."

This would prevent the initiation of further evaluation (e.g., chest X-ray) and potential prophylactic treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). This failure to act increases the healthcare worker's personal risk of progressing to active TB disease and poses a transmission risk to patients and colleagues."

Inconclusive results are typically associated with improper administration, reading outside the 48-72 hour window, or a borderline measurement with ill-defined edges. \n\n**Clinical Rationale:** A two-step test is a baseline screening method for individuals who will be periodically re-tested (like healthcare workers) to prevent misinterpretation of a boosted reaction as a new infection on a subsequent test. It is not used to confirm a clearly positive initial result. The correct action for a positive result is clinical and radiological evaluation, not re-testing."

This is because their suppressed cell-mediated immunity cannot mount a robust inflammatory response, resulting in a smaller induration even when infected. \n\n**Clinical Rationale:** This option wrongly implies that a 12 mm result is only significant in the context of severe immunocompromise. It ignores the specific occupational risk category of the healthcare worker, which has its own distinct threshold of ≥10 mm."

It's critical to remember that healthcare workers fall into the moderate-risk category, which uses the ≥10 mm threshold for a positive interpretation. A common error is to see a result like 12 mm and think it's negative because it's less than 15 mm, failing to account for the client's occupational risk."
