A goiter represents hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells. This can be caused by overstimulation from TSH in primary hypothyroidism (due to a lack of negative feedback from T3/T4 on the pituitary) or by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins in Graves' disease (which causes TSH to be suppressed). TSH is the most sensitive biomarker to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and differentiate between primary hyperthyroidism (low TSH) and primary hypothyroidism (high TSH), which are the most common causes of a goiter."

While thyroid hormones influence glucose metabolism (hyperthyroidism can cause hyperglycemia via increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis), assessing blood glucose does not diagnose the primary thyroid pathology.

Investigating glucose levels would be a secondary consideration after thyroid function is established."

This choice confuses the function of the thyroid gland with the parathyroid glands, which are anatomically posterior to the thyroid but functionally distinct. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) to regulate calcium. The thyroid gland's role in calcium homeostasis via calcitonin is minimal in humans. While a very large goiter or thyroid surgery could potentially compromise parathyroid function, assessing calcium is not the initial diagnostic step for evaluating the goiter itself. The client's signs and symptoms are not indicative of hypocalcemia (e.g., tetany, Chvostek's sign) or hypercalcemia (e.g., bone pain, kidney stones)."

For example, severe hypothyroidism can cause a normocytic, normochromic anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production and reduced metabolic demands. However, measuring hemoglobin would not reveal the etiology of the goiter. The essential first step is to assess the functional state of the thyroid gland itself via the HPT axis."
