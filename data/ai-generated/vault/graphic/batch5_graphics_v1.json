The peeling (desquamation) of the skin on the hands and feet is a characteristic finding of the subacute phase (weeks 2-4), resulting from initial inflammation and endothelial damage to the microvasculature in the extremities.

This aggregation alters the lens's refractive index and causes opacification, which physically scatters incoming light instead of focusing it cleanly on the retina. This light scatter is responsible for the classic symptoms of disabling glare (especially from point sources like headlights at night) and progressively blurry vision. The visible cloudy, opaque lens in the image is the direct clinical manifestation of this protein clumping."

This can be caused by overstimulation from TSH in primary hypothyroidism (due to a lack of negative feedback from T3/T4 on the pituitary) or by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins in Graves' disease (which causes TSH to be suppressed). TSH is the most sensitive biomarker to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and differentiate between primary hyperthyroidism (low TSH) and primary hypothyroidism (high TSH), which are the most common causes of a goiter."

While a very large goiter or thyroid surgery could potentially compromise parathyroid function, assessing calcium is not the initial diagnostic step for evaluating the goiter itself.
