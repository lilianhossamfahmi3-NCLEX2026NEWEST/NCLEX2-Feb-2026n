            "correct": "Compartment syndrome is a condition caused by increased pressure within a confined space, typically in the extremities. This increased pressure impedes blood flow, leading to ischemia and potential tissue damage.\n\nPallor (pale skin) indicates impaired circulation due to increased pressure, leading to decreased blood flow to the tissues. Pulselessness distal to the injury is a late and ominous sign of compartment syndrome, indicating severely compromised arterial supply. Pain out of proportion to the injury, especially with passive stretching of the affected muscles, is a hallmark symptom. Paresthesia (numbness or tingling) occurs due to nerve compression from increased pressure within the compartment. Poikilothermia (inability to regulate temperature, resulting in coolness) indicates compromised blood flow to the extremity. The key is to recognize the disproportionate pain and neurovascular changes.",
