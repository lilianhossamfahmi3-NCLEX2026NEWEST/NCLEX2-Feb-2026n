            "correct": "Highlighted findings indicate potential complications of mechanical ventilation. A sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) often signals increased airway resistance (e.g., bronchospasm, mucus plugging, kinked ET tube) or decreased lung compliance (e.g., pneumothorax, pulmonary edema). Hypotension can be a consequence of positive pressure ventilation decreasing venous return and cardiac output, especially in hypovolemic patients. A drop in SpO2 indicates hypoxemia which must be addressed to prevent end-organ damage. High FiO2 levels (>60%) for prolonged periods can lead to oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. While some level of agitation is common, increased agitation may indicate inadequate ventilation, pain, or delirium and requires assessment. Normal tidal volume (Vt) does not necessarily rule out issues as the ideal Vt depends on the patient’s ideal body weight and lung pathology; trending values and clinical context are essential. Plateau pressure is an indicator of alveolar pressure and should be maintained below 30 cm H2O to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).",

Alert and oriented prior to intubation.\n\n**B:** Admitted from ED with productive cough, fever, and increasing shortness of breath. Initial ABG showed respiratory acidosis. Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Initial ventilator settings: FiO2 60%, Vt 500 mL, RR 16, PEEP 5.\n\n**A:** Currently on the following ventilator settings: FiO2 70%, Vt 500 mL, RR 16, PEEP 5. Last ABG (06:00) pH 7.30, PaCO2 55, PaO2 90, HCO3 26. PIP increased from 25 to 40 cm H2O within the last hour. Blood pressure decreased from 130/80 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg. SpO2 decreased from 95% to 88%. Patient appears more agitated than previously documented. Plateau pressure is 32 cm H2O.\n\n**R:** I am concerned about the sudden increase in PIP, decreased blood pressure and SpO2, and the patient's increased agitation. Recommend immediate assessment of airway patency, suctioning if needed, and evaluation for pneumothorax. Consider adjusting ventilator settings and/or administering sedation/analgesia as appropriate. Please assess and advise. Consider reducing FiO2 if tolerated.",
