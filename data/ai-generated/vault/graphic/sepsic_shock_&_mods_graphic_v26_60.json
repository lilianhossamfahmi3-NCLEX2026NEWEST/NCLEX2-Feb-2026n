Patient is increasingly confused and lethargic.\nB: History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Initial pneumonia diagnosis confirmed by chest x-ray. Received initial antibiotics per protocol, but condition worsening. Lactate increasing.\nA: Septic shock secondary to pneumonia. Hypotension refractory to initial fluid bolus. Evidence of end-organ dysfunction with decreased urine output and altered mental status. Requiring increased respiratory support. Possible MODS developing.\nR: Recommend immediate vasopressor support, further fluid resuscitation, repeat blood cultures, and consideration for transfer to ICU. Assess for source control. Monitor lactate and ABGs closely. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, adjusted based on culture results. Evaluate for acute kidney injury and initiate renal protective strategies.",
