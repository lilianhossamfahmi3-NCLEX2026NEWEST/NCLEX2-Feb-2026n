Increasingly confused and lethargic.\nB: History: hypertension, type 2 diabetes. Pneumonia confirmed via chest x-ray. Initial antibiotics given per protocol, but worsening. Lactate rising.\nA: Septic shock secondary to pneumonia. Hypotension not responding to initial fluids. End-organ dysfunction: low urine output, altered mental status. Increased respiratory support needed. Possible MODS.\nR: Recommend immediate vasopressor support, more fluids, repeat blood cultures, ICU transfer consideration. Check for infection source.
