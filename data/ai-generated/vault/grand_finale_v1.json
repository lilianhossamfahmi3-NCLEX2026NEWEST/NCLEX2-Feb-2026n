The priority is to restore organized electrical activity and perfusion immediately.",

V-fib is a chaotic rhythm with no coordinated ventricular contraction, resulting in no cardiac output and rapid deterioration. Defibrillation delivers a high-energy electrical shock that simultaneously depolarizes all myocardial cells, interrupting the chaotic electrical activity and allowing the sinoatrial (SA) node to resume its role as the heart's primary pacemaker.",

Defibrillation is the definitive treatment to convert V-fib to a perfusing rhythm.",

This location is below the conus medullaris (L1-L2), minimizing spinal cord injury risk.

The High-Fowler position involves sitting upright, placing the spine under axial load, compressing intervertebral discs and narrowing the space between spinous processes. While sitting and leaning forward over a bedside table can flex the spine, High-Fowler promotes spinal extension or neutral alignment, making needle insertion unsafe and difficult.
