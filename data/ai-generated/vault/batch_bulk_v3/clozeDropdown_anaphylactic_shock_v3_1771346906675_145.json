    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of anaphylactic shock (hypotension, stridor, urticaria), a life-threatening emergency triggered by an exaggerated IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to wasp venom. This reaction causes mast cell and basophil degranulation, releasing histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. These mediators lead to systemic vasodilation (causing hypotension), increased capillary permeability (leading to edema and fluid shifts), bronchoconstriction (causing stridor and respiratory distress), and urticaria. The immediate, first-line treatment is epinephrine 0.3 mg administered intramuscularly (IM) into the mid-outer thigh (vastus lateralis). Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist. Its alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and decreasing mucosal edema. Its beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, reversing respiratory distress. Concurrently, aggressive fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid like 0.9% sodium chloride is crucial to restore intravascular volume and treat hypotension resulting from vasodilation and capillary leak. Placing the client in a supine position with legs elevated (modified Trendelenburg) promotes venous return to the heart, further improving blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. This position increases preload, enhancing cardiac output.",
