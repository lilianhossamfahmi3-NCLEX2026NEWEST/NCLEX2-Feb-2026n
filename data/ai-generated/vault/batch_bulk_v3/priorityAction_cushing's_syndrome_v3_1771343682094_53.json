Hypokalemia is a known complication of Cushing's syndrome due to the mineralocorticoid effects of excess cortisol, leading to potassium excretion. This electrolyte imbalance is the likely cause of the client's cardiac instability (irregular tachycardia at 118/min). Correcting the severe hypokalemia is the highest priority to prevent fatal dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, thereby stabilizing the client's circulatory status.",

Administering a potassium-wasting diuretic like furosemide would be dangerous and could worsen the hypokalemia. Managing blood sugar and initiating antibiotic therapy are important but secondary to stabilizing the client's cardiac function.",
