    "correct": "The client's potassium level of 2.9 mEq/L indicates severe hypokalemia, a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. In Cushing's syndrome, excess cortisol mimics mineralocorticoid activity, leading to increased sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys. This hypokalemia is the most likely cause of the client's irregular heart rhythm (HR 118 bpm). Severe hypokalemia can disrupt the normal electrical activity of the heart, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation) and cardiac arrest. Administering IV potassium chloride is crucial to rapidly restore potassium levels, stabilize the myocardium, and prevent potentially fatal cardiac complications.",
    "incorrect": "While the client exhibits signs of fluid overload (edema, crackles, hypertension), hyperglycemia, and potential infection (elevated WBC, fever), these are not as immediately life-threatening as the cardiac instability caused by severe hypokalemia. Furosemide, a potassium-wasting diuretic, would worsen the hypokalemia and increase the risk of arrhythmias. Addressing hyperglycemia and initiating antibiotics are important but secondary to stabilizing the client's cardiac function.",

Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and water. In a client with existing hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L), administering furosemide would further deplete potassium levels, exacerbating the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. This action is contraindicated in this situation.",

Hypokalemia reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to arrhythmias.
