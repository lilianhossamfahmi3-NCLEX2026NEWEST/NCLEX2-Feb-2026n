    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions to restore oxygenation, followed by summoning help and performing rapid assessments to identify the cause of deterioration. Disconnecting the ventilator and manually ventilating with 100% FiO2 addresses acute hypoxemia by eliminating the ventilator as a potential problem and providing maximal oxygenation. The rapid response team and respiratory therapist are crucial for advanced interventions and ventilator management. Auscultation helps identify potential issues like pneumothorax or tube displacement. Suctioning addresses potential airway obstruction. Sedation is addressed last, as agitation is likely secondary to hypoxia.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect orders fail to prioritize immediate life threats. Sedating before addressing hypoxia can worsen respiratory drive and mask the underlying problem. Troubleshooting the ventilator or suctioning before ensuring adequate oxygenation delays critical intervention and can lead to cardiovascular collapse.",

        "explanation": "High-pressure alarm and desaturation indicate a life-threatening oxygenation/ventilation problem. Causes can be patient-related (pneumothorax, bronchospasm, mucus plug) or ventilator-related. Manual ventilation eliminates the machine as the source and delivers 100% oxygen, correcting severe hypoxemia. ARDS pathophysiology involves alveolar inflammation and fluid accumulation, impairing gas exchange. Manual ventilation provides immediate support while addressing the underlying cause."

        "explanation": "Checking for obstruction is the next step. A mucus plug is a common cause of high-pressure alarms. Gentle suctioning confirms or rules out obstruction. ARDS patients often have increased mucus production due to inflammation and impaired mucociliary clearance, increasing the risk of airway obstruction."

        "explanation": "Agitation is likely due to severe hypoxia ('air hunger'). Sedating before correcting hypoxemia is dangerous, suppressing respiratory drive and masking deterioration. Once oxygenation is restored, sedation decreases oxygen consumption and improves ventilator synchrony. Hypoxia-induced agitation increases metabolic demand and oxygen consumption, further exacerbating respiratory distress."

    "When a high-pressure ventilator alarm sounds and the patient is desaturating, immediately disconnect the ventilator and manually ventilate with a bag-valve mask at 100% FiO2. This ensures immediate oxygenation and helps differentiate between patient-related and ventilator-related issues.",
    "Agitation in a patient on a ventilator is often a sign of hypoxia and should be addressed by improving oxygenation and ventilation before administering sedatives. Sedatives can mask underlying respiratory problems and worsen hypoxia.",
