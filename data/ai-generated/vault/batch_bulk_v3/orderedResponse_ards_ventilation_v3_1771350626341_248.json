The ventilator's high-pressure alarm sounds, and the client's SpO2 rapidly drops to 82%. The client appears agitated and is attempting to pull at the endotracheal tube. The nurse must intervene immediately. Drag and drop the actions into the box to indicate the priority order in which they should be performed. All actions are appropriate.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions to restore oxygenation, followed by summoning help and performing rapid assessments to identify the cause of deterioration. The first priority is to resolve the acute hypoxemia by removing the variable of the ventilator and providing 100% oxygen via manual ventilation. Immediately after stabilizing breathing, the nurse must call for assistance from a multidisciplinary team. Subsequent actions involve rapid, focused assessments (auscultation, checking for obstruction) to diagnose the problem. Finally, treating symptoms like agitation with medication is the last step, as the agitation is likely secondary to hypoxia, which must be addressed first.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect order would fail to prioritize the most immediate life threat, which is severe hypoxemia. For example, administering a sedative first could worsen respiratory drive and mask the underlying problem. Similarly, spending time troubleshooting the ventilator or suctioning before ensuring a patent airway and adequate oxygen delivery via manual ventilation would delay critical oxygenation and could lead to cardiovascular collapse.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the first and most critical action. A high-pressure alarm coupled with rapid desaturation indicates a life-threatening problem with oxygenation or ventilation. The cause could be the patient (e.g., pneumothorax, bronchospasm, mucus plug) or the ventilator/circuit. Disconnecting the ventilator and manually bagging the patient immediately eliminates the machine as the problem source and delivers 100% oxygen to correct severe hypoxemia."

                "explanation": "While manually ventilating the patient, the nurse cannot manage the situation alone. This is a respiratory emergency requiring a multidisciplinary team. The respiratory therapist is essential for managing the ventilator and airway, and the rapid response team/provider is needed for advanced diagnostics and interventions. This must be done immediately after stabilizing the patient's breathing."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "While continuing to manually ventilate and waiting for assistance, the nurse should perform a rapid assessment. Auscultating breath sounds is a key diagnostic step. Absent breath sounds on one side could indicate a pneumothorax or endotracheal tube displacement into a mainstem bronchus, requiring immediate intervention."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "After assessing breath sounds, checking for an obstruction is the next logical step. A large mucus plug is a common cause of high-pressure alarms. Gently attempting to pass a suction catheter can quickly confirm or rule out an obstruction within the tube. If an obstruction is met, suctioning can resolve the problem."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This action should be performed last. The client's agitation is most likely a symptom of severe hypoxia (i.e., 'air hunger'). Administering a sedative before addressing and correcting the underlying cause of hypoxemia is dangerous as it can suppress the respiratory drive and mask clinical deterioration. Once oxygenation is restored and the cause is being managed, sedation can be administered to decrease oxygen consumption and improve ventilator synchrony."
