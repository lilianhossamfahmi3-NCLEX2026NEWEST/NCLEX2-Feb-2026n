    "correct": "The client's presentation of sudden onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, severe hypoxia, tachycardia, and profound hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) in the context of a recent major orthopedic surgery strongly indicates a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causing obstructive shock. The primary goals are to stabilize hemodynamics and initiate anticoagulation. Administering a fluid bolus (0.9% NaCl) is critical to increase right ventricular preload and improve cardiac output and blood pressure in obstructive shock. Initiating an unfractionated heparin infusion is the cornerstone of treatment to prevent further clot formation and propagation. The effectiveness of these interventions is monitored by tracking hemodynamic stability via Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and the therapeutic effect of heparin via the aPTT. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** A massive PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction. This results in decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Fluid boluses increase right ventricular preload, potentially improving cardiac output. Heparin prevents further clot formation, allowing the body's natural thrombolytic mechanisms to work. MAP reflects systemic perfusion, and aPTT monitors the therapeutic range of heparin.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting other conditions would lead to incorrect and potentially harmful interventions. For example, treating for heart failure with diuretics (furosemide) would exacerbate the hypotension from obstructive shock. Actions like administering morphine could worsen respiratory depression and hypotension. Monitoring parameters must be specific to the interventions; for instance, while troponin may be elevated due to right heart strain in a PE, it is not the primary parameter used to titrate heparin or assess fluid resuscitation.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Misdiagnosing the condition leads to interventions that do not address the underlying cause of obstructive shock. Diuretics decrease preload, worsening hypotension. Morphine depresses respiratory drive and causes vasodilation, further compromising hemodynamics. Monitoring irrelevant parameters delays appropriate treatment and can lead to adverse outcomes.",
