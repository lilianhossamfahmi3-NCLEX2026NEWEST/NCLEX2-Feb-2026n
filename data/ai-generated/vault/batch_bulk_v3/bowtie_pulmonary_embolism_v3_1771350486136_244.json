The primary goals are to stabilize hemodynamics and initiate anticoagulation. Administering a fluid bolus (0.9% NaCl) is critical to increase right ventricular preload and improve cardiac output and blood pressure in obstructive shock. Initiating an unfractionated heparin infusion is the cornerstone of treatment to prevent further clot formation and propagation. The effectiveness of these interventions is monitored by tracking hemodynamic stability via Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and the therapeutic effect of heparin via the aPTT.",

For example, treating for heart failure with diuretics (furosemide) would exacerbate the hypotension from obstructive shock. Actions like administering morphine could worsen respiratory depression and hypotension. Monitoring parameters must be specific to the interventions; for instance, while troponin may be elevated due to right heart strain in a PE, it is not the primary parameter used to titrate heparin or assess fluid resuscitation.",
