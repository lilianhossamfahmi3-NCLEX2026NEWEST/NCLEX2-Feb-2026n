    "question": "A 52-year-old client with a history of major depressive disorder and migraines is admitted to the medical-surgical unit. The client's medications include sertraline 100 mg daily, sumatriptan 50 mg as needed for migraines, and tramadol 50 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. Two hours after receiving a dose of tramadol for back pain, the nurse finds the client agitated, confused, and diaphoretic. Assessment findings include: Temperature 39.2°C (102.6°F), heart rate 128/min, respirations 24/min, blood pressure 168/98 mmHg. The client exhibits tremors and hyperreflexia with inducible clonus in the lower extremities. The nurse suspects Serotonin Syndrome. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of Serotonin Syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. The combination of sertraline (SSRI), sumatriptan (triptan), and tramadol (opioid with serotonergic properties) significantly increases this risk. The priority actions are to stop the offending agents, provide supportive care to manage autonomic instability and hyperthermia, and control neuromuscular hyperactivity.",
        "incorrect": "Management focuses on removing the cause and providing supportive care. Interventions that are ineffective or could worsen the client's condition should be avoided. Administering antipyretics is not effective as the hyperthermia is caused by muscle activity, not an altered hypothalamic set point. Antipsychotics like haloperidol can impair heat dissipation and are contraindicated.",
