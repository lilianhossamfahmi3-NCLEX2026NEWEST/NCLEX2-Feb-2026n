  "question": "A 52-year-old client with a history of major depressive disorder and migraines is admitted to the medical-surgical unit. The client's medications include sertraline 100 mg daily, sumatriptan 50 mg as needed for migraines, and tramadol 50 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. Two hours after receiving a dose of tramadol for back pain, the nurse finds the client agitated, confused, and diaphoretic. Assessment findings include: Temperature 39.2°C (102.6°F), heart rate 128/min, respirations 24/min, blood pressure 168/98 mmHg. The client exhibits tremors and hyperreflexia with inducible clonus in the lower extremities. The nurse suspects Serotonin Syndrome. Using the SBAR format, and considering the client's presentation, which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of Serotonin Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The combination of sertraline (SSRI), sumatriptan (triptan), and tramadol (opioid with serotonergic properties) significantly elevates the risk. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Serotonin Syndrome arises from an overstimulation of serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, in the brainstem and spinal cord. This overstimulation leads to a cascade of effects, including altered mental status (agitation, confusion), autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular abnormalities (tremors, hyperreflexia, clonus). Tramadol inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and is an opioid agonist. \n\n**SBAR Rationale:**\n*   **Situation:** 52-year-old with MDD and migraines, presenting with agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, hyperthermia (39.2°C), tachycardia (128/min), hypertension (168/98 mmHg), tremors, and hyperreflexia with inducible clonus after tramadol administration at 1400.\n*   **Background:** History of MDD and migraines, taking sertraline, sumatriptan, and tramadol. Received tramadol at 1400 for back pain.\n*   **Assessment:** Suspect Serotonin Syndrome due to the combination of medications and clinical presentation.\n*   **Recommendation:** Immediately discontinue sertraline and tramadol. Request order for benzodiazepine (lorazepam). Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring and cooling measures.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Serotonin Syndrome can be difficult to distinguish from Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Key differentiating factors include the rapid onset (within 24 hours) and presence of hyperreflexia and clonus in Serotonin Syndrome, which are less common in NMS.",
    "incorrect": "Management focuses on removing the cause and providing supportive care. Interventions that are ineffective or could worsen the client's condition should be avoided. Administering antipyretics is not effective as the hyperthermia is caused by muscle activity, not an altered hypothalamic set point. Antipsychotics like haloperidol can impair heat dissipation and are contraindicated.",
