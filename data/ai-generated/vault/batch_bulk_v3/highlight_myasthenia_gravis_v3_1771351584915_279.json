    "question": "The nurse in a neurology clinic receives a telephone call from a client with a history of myasthenia gravis. The nurse should instruct the client to go to the emergency department based on which of the following statements? Click to highlight the findings that require immediate intervention.",
    "text": "Hello, I'm calling because I'm not feeling well today. My eyelids are more droopy today than usual, and I just feel generally more tired this afternoon. What's really worrying me is that I'm finding it harder to swallow my saliva. My voice sounds very quiet and nasal, which my husband noticed too. I took my pyridostigmine an hour ago, but it feels like I have to work to take a deep breath.",

        "correct": "The combination of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), a quiet/nasal voice (dysphonia/dysarthria), and increased work of breathing (dyspnea) are cardinal signs of impending myasthenic crisis. These symptoms indicate significant bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness, which can rapidly progress to airway obstruction from aspiration or respiratory failure from muscle fatigue. This constitutes a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation and potential intervention to protect the airway and support breathing.",
        "incorrect": "While worsening ptosis and generalized fatigue are characteristic of myasthenia gravis, they represent a fluctuation in symptoms rather than an immediate life-threatening emergency. These symptoms alone do not typically require an emergency department visit and can often be managed on an outpatient basis. The statement about taking pyridostigmine provides clinical context but is not a finding itself.",
