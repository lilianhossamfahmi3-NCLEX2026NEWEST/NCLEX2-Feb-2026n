  "question": "The nurse in a neurology clinic receives a telephone call from a client with a history of myasthenia gravis. The nurse should instruct the client to go to the emergency department based on which of the following statements? Click to highlight the findings that require immediate intervention.",
  "text": "Hello, I'm calling because I'm not feeling well today. My eyelids are more droopy today than usual, and I just feel generally more tired this afternoon. What's really worrying me is that I'm finding it harder to swallow my saliva. My voice sounds very quiet and nasal, which my husband noticed too. I took my pyridostigmine an hour ago, but it feels like I have to work to take a deep breath.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of a potential myasthenic crisis, a life-threatening exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. The key findings are dysphagia (difficulty swallowing saliva), dysarthria/dysphonia (quiet, nasal voice), and dyspnea (increased work of breathing). These indicate severe weakness of bulbar and respiratory muscles. Dysphagia increases aspiration risk, while respiratory muscle weakness can lead to hypoventilation, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent airway compromise and respiratory arrest. This includes airway management, possible intubation and mechanical ventilation, and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against acetylcholine receptors.",
    "incorrect": "While worsening ptosis and fatigue are common in myasthenia gravis, they don't represent the same immediate threat as bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Ptosis, while bothersome, doesn't directly impair breathing or swallowing. Fatigue is a chronic symptom. The pyridostigmine statement provides context but isn't a critical symptom requiring immediate ED intervention.",

        "label": "My eyelids are more droopy today than usual",
        "content": "Incorrect. Worsening ptosis (drooping eyelids) indicates increased muscle weakness, but it's a gradual symptom and not immediately life-threatening. It reflects fluctuating acetylcholine receptor blockade. While concerning, it doesn't warrant immediate ED visit unless accompanied by bulbar or respiratory symptoms.",

        "label": "I just feel generally more tired this afternoon",
        "content": "Incorrect. Fatigue is a hallmark of myasthenia gravis due to impaired neuromuscular transmission. While increased fatigue is concerning, it's a common symptom fluctuation and not an emergency unless accompanied by respiratory or swallowing difficulties. It reflects the reduced availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.",

      {
        "label": "I'm finding it harder to swallow my saliva",
        "content": "Correct. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) indicates bulbar muscle weakness, specifically affecting the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus. This poses a significant risk of aspiration pneumonia, a life-threatening complication. Impaired swallowing reflexes and reduced esophageal peristalsis contribute to this risk. This requires immediate evaluation and intervention to protect the airway.",

      {
        "label": "My voice sounds very quiet and nasal",
        "content": "Correct. A quiet, nasal voice (dysphonia/dysarthria) indicates weakness of the laryngeal and palatal muscles, also part of the bulbar musculature. This impairs the ability to articulate and project the voice effectively. Weakness of the soft palate leads to nasal speech. This is a sign of significant disease progression and potential for respiratory compromise.",

        "label": "I took my pyridostigmine an hour ago",
        "content": "Incorrect. While medication adherence is important, the statement itself isn't a symptom. The fact that symptoms are worsening despite medication suggests the current dose may be inadequate or the client is developing resistance, but the statement itself doesn't indicate immediate danger.",

      },
      {
        "label": "it feels like I have to work to take a deep breath",
        "content": "Correct. Increased work of breathing (dyspnea) indicates respiratory muscle weakness, primarily affecting the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. This leads to reduced tidal volume and impaired gas exchange, potentially causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia. This is a critical sign of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate intervention, including possible intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
        "isCorrect": true

    ],
    "clinicalPearls": "Myasthenic crisis is a medical emergency. Remember the 'ABC's: Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Rapid assessment and intervention are crucial. Monitor vital capacity and arterial blood gases closely. Differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crisis (caused by excessive anticholinesterase medication) – edrophonium (Tensilon) test can help, but use with caution. Always have atropine available as an antidote for cholinergic crisis. SBAR is a useful tool for communicating patient status."

Anticipate the need for airway management, possible intubation and mechanical ventilation, and administration of IVIG or plasmapheresis. Notify the ED of the client's impending arrival and the potential for myasthenic crisis. Obtain a baseline set of vital signs upon arrival to the ED."
