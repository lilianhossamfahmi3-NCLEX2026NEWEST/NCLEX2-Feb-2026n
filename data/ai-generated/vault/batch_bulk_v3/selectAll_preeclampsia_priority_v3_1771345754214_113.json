    "question": "The nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client at 34 weeks gestation admitted with preeclampsia with severe features. The client is receiving a continuous intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate at 2 g/hr. The nurse performs an assessment and obtains the following data.\n\n**Client Assessment Data:**\n*   Blood pressure: 168/112 mmHg\n*   Heart rate: 98 beats/minute\n*   Respiratory rate: 10 breaths/minute\n*   SpO2: 92% on room air\n*   Urine output: 20 mL/hr over the past 2 hours\n*   Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs): 1+ bilaterally\n*   Client states, \"I feel so sleepy and my vision is blurry.\"\n\nWhich actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of magnesium sulfate toxicity, a life-threatening emergency. The cluster of cues including a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/minute, SpO2 of 92%, 1+ DTRs (hyporeflexia), oliguria, and reported somnolence/blurry vision indicates CNS and respiratory depression. The immediate priorities are to stop the causative agent (magnesium sulfate), administer the antidote (calcium gluconate) to reverse the cardiorespiratory effects, provide respiratory support with high-flow oxygen, and notify the provider for further orders and collaborative management.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing IV fluids is contraindicated in a preeclamptic patient with oliguria, as it increases the risk of pulmonary edema. Administering more labetalol addresses the hypertension but not the immediate life-threatening respiratory depression from magnesium toxicity. Preparing for a cesarean section is not the priority; maternal stabilization must occur first to ensure a safe outcome for both mother and fetus.",

The client's urine output is 20 mL/hr (oliguria), which is a sign of poor renal perfusion and a risk factor for developing magnesium toxicity as the medication is cleared by the kidneys.
