The client is receiving a continuous intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate at 2 g/hr. The nurse performs an assessment at 1400 and obtains the following data:\n\n**Client Assessment Data:**\n*   Blood pressure: 168/112 mmHg\n*   Heart rate: 98 beats/minute\n*   Respiratory rate: 10 breaths/minute\n*   SpO2: 92% on room air\n*   Urine output: 20 mL/hr over the past 2 hours\n*   Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs): 1+ bilaterally\n*   Client states, \"I feel so sleepy and my vision is blurry.\"\n\nWhich actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of magnesium sulfate toxicity, a life-threatening emergency. Magnesium sulfate, while used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia, can cause central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression if serum levels become too high. This occurs because magnesium blocks calcium channels, inhibiting neuromuscular transmission. The cluster of cues including a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/minute, SpO2 of 92%, 1+ DTRs (hyporeflexia), oliguria (20mL/hr), and reported somnolence/blurry vision indicates CNS and respiratory depression. The immediate priorities are to stop the causative agent (magnesium sulfate) to prevent further accumulation, administer the antidote (calcium gluconate) to reverse the cardiorespiratory effects by restoring calcium balance, provide respiratory support with high-flow oxygen to counteract hypoxemia, and notify the provider for further orders and collaborative management.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing IV fluids is contraindicated in a preeclamptic patient with oliguria, as it increases the risk of pulmonary edema due to capillary leak and impaired renal function. Administering more labetalol addresses the hypertension but not the immediate life-threatening respiratory depression from magnesium toxicity. Furthermore, lowering the blood pressure too rapidly can compromise placental perfusion. Preparing for a cesarean section is not the priority; maternal stabilization must occur first to ensure a safe outcome for both mother and fetus.",

The client's urine output is 20 mL/hr (oliguria), which is a sign of poor renal perfusion and a risk factor for developing magnesium toxicity as the medication is cleared by the kidneys. Preeclampsia causes endothelial damage, leading to capillary leak and decreased intravascular volume. Increasing IV fluids in the presence of oliguria and capillary leak associated with preeclampsia significantly increases the risk for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.",

Magnesium sulfate toxicity occurs because magnesium blocks calcium channels, leading to neuromuscular blockade. Calcium gluconate provides an influx of calcium, counteracting the effects of magnesium.
