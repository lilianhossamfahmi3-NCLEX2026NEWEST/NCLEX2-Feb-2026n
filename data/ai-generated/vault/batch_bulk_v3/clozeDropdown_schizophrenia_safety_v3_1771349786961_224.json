        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions focuses on de-escalation using the least restrictive interventions first, while ensuring safety for both the client and the nurse. The initial step is to build rapport by acknowledging the client's underlying emotion (fear) without validating or challenging the delusion. This validation of feelings can reduce anxiety. Simultaneously, the nurse must maintain a safe distance and non-threatening posture to avoid escalating the client's paranoia and to ensure a clear exit path. Finally, offering sealed food and drink directly addresses the content of the client's delusion in a therapeutic way. It demonstrates the nurse is listening and is trying to help, which builds trust and can meet the client's nutritional needs.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices involve actions that are either too restrictive, confrontational, or dismissive of the client's experience. Administering medication or using seclusion are not initial actions unless verbal de-escalation fails or the client is an immediate danger. Confronting delusions, arguing, or attempting to reorient a highly paranoid client will increase agitation. Physical touch, blocking exits, or maintaining intense eye contact can be perceived as threatening and will escalate the situation. Bringing security into the room or forcing group participation are also counter-therapeutic and escalating actions for a client in this state.",
