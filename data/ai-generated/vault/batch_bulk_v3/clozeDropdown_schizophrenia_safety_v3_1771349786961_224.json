    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes de-escalation using the least restrictive interventions while ensuring safety. Acknowledging the client's fear without validating the delusion builds rapport and reduces anxiety. Maintaining a safe distance (4-5 feet) and non-threatening posture prevents escalation. Offering sealed food/drink directly addresses the delusion, demonstrating the nurse is listening and trying to help, fostering trust and meeting nutritional needs. In paranoid schizophrenia, the dopamine pathways in the brain are often overactive, leading to hallucinations and delusions. Addressing the client's immediate concerns can help regulate their emotional state and reduce the impact of these neurological imbalances.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices are either too restrictive, confrontational, or dismissive. Medication/seclusion are not initial actions unless verbal de-escalation fails or the client is an immediate danger. Confronting delusions or attempting reorientation increases agitation. Physical touch, blocking exits, or intense eye contact are perceived as threatening. Bringing security or forcing group participation are counter-therapeutic and escalating. These actions can trigger the client's fight-or-flight response, further exacerbating their paranoia and potentially leading to aggressive behavior.",

  "clinicalPearl": "When interacting with a client experiencing paranoia, prioritize safety, build trust by acknowledging their feelings, and avoid challenging their delusions directly.

    "assessment": "The client is pacing, shouting delusions of being poisoned, and exhibiting signs of anxiety and paranoia, including increased heart rate and rapid speech. He is not currently an immediate threat to himself or others, but his agitation is escalating.",

The team should consider administering PRN olanzapine if de-escalation is unsuccessful within the next 30 minutes, and monitor the client closely for further escalation or signs of distress. Notify the physician if the client's condition does not improve or worsens."
