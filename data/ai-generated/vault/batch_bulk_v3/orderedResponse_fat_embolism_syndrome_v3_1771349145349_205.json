    "question": "A 22-year-old client is on the orthopedic unit 24 hours after an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a comminuted right femur fracture. The nurse enters the room and finds the client agitated, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 32/min, and complaining of severe shortness of breath. The client's SpO2 is 86% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. The nurse notes a fine, non-blanching petechial rash across the client's chest and axillae. Suspecting Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), the nurse must act quickly. Arrange the following nursing interventions in the order they should be performed. Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence, with the highest priority action at the top.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions based on the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, followed by escalation of care and preparation for advanced interventions. The client's presentation of severe hypoxemia (SpO2 86%), tachypnea, agitation, and a petechial rash is classic for Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), a medical emergency. The first priority is to correct the life-threatening hypoxemia by applying a high-concentration oxygen device. Next, positioning the client upright helps maximize lung expansion. Immediately after these initial stabilizing actions, the nurse must activate the Rapid Response Team to bring critical care expertise to the bedside. Subsequent actions involve obtaining definitive diagnostic data (ABG) to guide further treatment and anticipating the likely need for advanced airway management.",

FES causes fat globules to obstruct pulmonary capillaries, leading to a significant ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Applying a non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min provides the highest possible concentration of supplemental oxygen to correct this critical hypoxemia.",
