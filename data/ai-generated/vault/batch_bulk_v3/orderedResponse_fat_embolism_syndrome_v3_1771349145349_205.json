  "question": "A 22-year-old client is on the orthopedic unit 24 hours after an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a comminuted right femur fracture. At 1400, the nurse enters the room and finds the client agitated, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 32/min, and complaining of severe shortness of breath. The client's SpO2 is 86% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. The nurse notes a fine, non-blanching petechial rash across the client's chest and axillae. Suspecting Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), the nurse must act quickly. Arrange the following nursing interventions in the order they should be performed. Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence, with the highest priority action at the top.",

    "overall": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), followed by escalation of care and preparation for advanced interventions. FES occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, commonly after long bone fractures. These globules can travel to the lungs, causing inflammation, capillary damage, and ARDS. The petechial rash results from fat emboli obstructing dermal capillaries. Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 86%), tachypnea, agitation, and petechial rash are classic FES signs. The priority is correcting hypoxemia with high-flow oxygen. High-Fowler's position maximizes lung expansion. The RRT brings critical care expertise. ABGs provide data to guide treatment. Preparing for intubation anticipates likely respiratory failure.",
