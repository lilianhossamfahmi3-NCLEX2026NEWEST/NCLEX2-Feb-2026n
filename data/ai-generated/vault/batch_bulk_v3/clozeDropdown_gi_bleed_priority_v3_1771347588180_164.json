        "correct": "The client is exhibiting clear signs of hypovolemic shock secondary to an acute upper GI bleed (hypotension, tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis). The highest priority according to the principles of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is to address the life-threatening circulatory collapse. A single, small-bore (20-gauge) IV is inadequate for the rapid administration of crystalloid fluids and blood products required for resuscitation. Therefore, establishing a second, large-bore (18-gauge or larger) IV access is the most critical first action to facilitate aggressive volume replacement and stabilize the client.",
        "incorrect": "While other interventions such as administering a PPI, preparing for an EGD, and managing symptoms are part of the plan of care, they are not the immediate priority. The client's hemodynamic instability must be addressed first to prevent cardiovascular collapse. Pantoprazole's effect is not immediate, the EGD cannot be safely performed on an unstable client, and treating nausea is a comfort measure that is secondary to life-saving interventions.",
