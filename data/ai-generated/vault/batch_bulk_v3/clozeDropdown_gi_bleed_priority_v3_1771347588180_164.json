An initial assessment reveals the following findings: blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, heart rate 128 beats/min, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and SpO2 94% on room air.

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hypovolemic shock secondary to an acute upper GI bleed. The priority is addressing the circulatory collapse. A single 20-gauge IV is insufficient for rapid fluid and blood product administration. A second, large-bore (18-gauge or larger) IV is crucial for aggressive volume resuscitation and stabilization. This action directly addresses the immediate threat to the client's life by improving preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Without adequate circulating volume, oxygen delivery to vital organs is compromised, leading to cellular hypoxia and potential organ damage. This intervention aligns with the 'Circulation' component of the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).",
    "incorrect": "Administering pantoprazole, preparing for an EGD, and managing nausea are important but secondary to addressing the hemodynamic instability. Pantoprazole's effect is not immediate. An EGD cannot be safely performed on an unstable client. Treating nausea is a comfort measure.",

Monitor vital signs closely and anticipate the need for blood transfusions. Early intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes.",
