            "rationale": "Correct. Hypotension is a primary and common complication of hemodialysis due to the rapid removal of fluid from the intravascular space. The client's blood pressure dropped significantly from 168/94 mmHg to 112/68 mmHg, and he is reporting lightheadedness, a key symptom of hypotension. Frequent vital sign monitoring is essential to assess hemodynamic stability and determine the need for interventions like fluid administration or adjusting the client's position.",
            "isCorrect": true
        },
        "option-2": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Lisinopril is an antihypertensive medication. Given the client's post-dialysis blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg and symptoms of lightheadedness, administering an antihypertensive agent would exacerbate the hypotension and could lead to syncope or further complications. Antihypertensive medications are often held on dialysis days or administered after dialysis once blood pressure has stabilized.",
            "isCorrect": false
        },
        "option-3": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The patency of the vascular access site is critical. Assessing the AV fistula for a palpable thrill (vibration) and an audible bruit (swooshing sound) confirms that blood is flowing through the access. This assessment should be performed before and after each dialysis session to detect potential clotting or stenosis, which are serious complications.",

        "option-4": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Due to post-dialysis hypotension and fatigue, the client is at a high risk for falls. The report of feeling 'lightheaded' is a direct contraindication to immediate, unassisted ambulation. The nurse should instruct the client to sit and rest, and to call for assistance before getting up to prevent orthostatic hypotension and potential injury.",

        "option-5": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Patient education is an ongoing nursing responsibility. Reinforcing precautions for the fistula arm is crucial for long-term access preservation. Avoiding heavy lifting, tight clothing, sleeping on the arm, and blood pressure measurements on the access arm prevents damage, compression, and potential thrombosis of the fistula.",

        "option-6": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Headache, nausea, and restlessness are classic signs of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS). This condition can occur after hemodialysis due to the rapid removal of solutes from the blood, leading to a temporary osmotic gradient that causes fluid to shift into the brain cells, resulting in cerebral edema. While less common with modern dialysis techniques, it remains a potential complication, and monitoring for these neurological changes is a key safety measure.",

        "option-7": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Clients with ESRD have impaired potassium excretion and must adhere to a potassium-restricted diet to prevent life-threatening hyperkalemia.
