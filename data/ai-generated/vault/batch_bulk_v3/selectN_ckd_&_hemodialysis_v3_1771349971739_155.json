  "answerBreakdown": {
    "option-1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Hypotension is a common complication post-hemodialysis due to rapid fluid removal, leading to decreased intravascular volume. The client's BP decreased significantly (168/94 mmHg to 112/68 mmHg), and he reports lightheadedness, a symptom of hypotension. Monitoring vital signs every 15-30 minutes post-dialysis helps detect and manage hypotension promptly. Interventions may include placing the client in Trendelenburg position or administering a bolus of normal saline to increase blood pressure.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-2": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension. Administering it post-dialysis, when the client is already hypotensive (112/68 mmHg) and symptomatic (lightheadedness), can further lower blood pressure, leading to potential complications like syncope or acute kidney injury. Antihypertensives are typically held before dialysis or administered cautiously after stabilization. The pathophysiology of post-dialysis hypotension involves decreased cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance due to fluid shifts and autonomic dysfunction.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-3": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Assessing the AV fistula for a palpable thrill and audible bruit is essential to ensure patency. The thrill is a vibration felt over the fistula, and the bruit is a swooshing sound heard with a stethoscope. Absence of either may indicate clotting or stenosis, compromising dialysis access. Early detection allows for timely intervention, such as thrombectomy or angioplasty, to maintain fistula function. The pathophysiology involves turbulent blood flow through the fistula, creating the thrill and bruit.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-4": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's report of lightheadedness and post-dialysis hypotension increases the risk of falls. Encouraging immediate ambulation is unsafe. The nurse should instruct the client to sit or lie down until the lightheadedness resolves and blood pressure stabilizes. Orthostatic hypotension, a drop in blood pressure upon standing, is common after dialysis due to fluid shifts and reduced blood volume.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-5": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Reinforcing teaching about AV fistula care is crucial for long-term access preservation. The client should avoid carrying heavy objects with the left arm to prevent compression or damage to the fistula. Other precautions include avoiding tight clothing, blood pressure measurements, and venipunctures on the fistula arm. These measures prevent thrombosis, stenosis, and infection, ensuring the fistula remains functional for dialysis.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-6": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Headache, nausea, and restlessness can be signs of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS), a rare but serious complication. DDS occurs due to rapid removal of solutes from the blood during dialysis, creating an osmotic gradient that causes fluid to shift into the brain cells, leading to cerebral edema. Monitoring for these neurological symptoms allows for early intervention, such as slowing the dialysis rate or administering mannitol to reduce cerebral edema.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "option-7": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Clients with ESRD typically have hyperkalemia due to impaired potassium excretion. Offering a high-potassium snack like a banana is contraindicated. Dietary potassium restriction is essential to prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. While dialysis removes potassium, intake must be carefully managed between sessions. The pathophysiology involves the kidneys' inability to filter and excrete potassium, leading to elevated serum levels.",

    "assessment": "Client reports lightheadedness and fatigue. Post-dialysis BP 112/68 mmHg. AV fistula patent with palpable thrill and audible bruit.",
    "recommendation": "Monitor vital signs every 15-30 minutes. Encourage client to sit or lie down until lightheadedness resolves. Reinforce AV fistula care instructions. Monitor for signs of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS). Consider a small bolus of normal saline if hypotension persists."
