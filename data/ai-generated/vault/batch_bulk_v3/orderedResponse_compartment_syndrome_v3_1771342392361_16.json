  "stem": "A 25-year-old male is in the emergency department after a crush injury to his right forearm at a construction site. A cast was applied at 1400. The client now reports severe, throbbing pain in the right arm, rating it a 10/10, which is unrelieved by a recent dose of intravenous morphine. The nurse assesses the right hand and finds it is cool, pale, and edematous. The radial pulse is weak and thready, and capillary refill is 4 seconds. The client also reports paresthesia ('pins and needles' sensation).",

    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes interventions addressing the immediate threat to limb viability in acute compartment syndrome. This condition arises when increased pressure within a confined space (muscle compartment) compromises blood flow and nerve function. The '6 Ps' (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pressure) are classic signs. \n\n1.  **Notify the HCP:** This is paramount. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency. A fasciotomy (surgical incision to relieve pressure) is often required to prevent irreversible damage. Delay can lead to muscle necrosis, nerve damage, and potential limb loss.\n2.  **Loosen/Remove Cast:** Relieving external pressure is crucial. A tight cast exacerbates the problem. This action aims to improve blood flow to the affected area.\n3.  **Position at Heart Level:** Elevating the limb can decrease arterial inflow, worsening ischemia. A dependent position increases edema. Positioning at heart level optimizes arterial perfusion without increasing swelling.\n4.  **Prepare for Fasciotomy:** Anticipate the surgical intervention. Ensure NPO status, confirm IV access, and prepare for consent. Time is critical.\n5.  **Assess Unaffected Limb:** Establishing a baseline is important but secondary to immediate interventions for the affected limb.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering delays definitive treatment, risking irreversible nerve damage, muscle necrosis, and limb loss. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it reduces arterial blood flow. Assessing the unaffected limb before addressing the compromised limb wastes critical time. Delaying notification of the HCP can have devastating consequences.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention (fasciotomy) to restore perfusion. The nurse cannot resolve this independently. Delay increases the risk of permanent neuromuscular damage. The rapid increase in pressure within the fascial compartments compromises microcirculation, leading to ischemia and potential necrosis of muscle and nerve tissue. **Clinical Pearl:** Always suspect compartment syndrome in patients with casts, especially after trauma. Unrelieved pain, even with analgesics, is a red flag."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** After notifying the HCP, relieve external pressure. A tight cast is a common cause. This reduces intracompartmental pressure and improves blood flow while awaiting further orders. The cast acts as an external constricting force, further impeding blood flow to the already compromised tissues within the compartment. **Clinical Pearl:** Be prepared to bivalve or remove the cast completely. Have cast saw readily available. Document the time the cast was loosened/removed."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Position the limb at heart level (not elevated or dependent). Elevation decreases arterial inflow, worsening ischemia. A dependent position increases venous congestion and edema. Heart level promotes optimal arterial perfusion without exacerbating swelling. The goal is to maximize oxygen delivery to the ischemic tissues without increasing pressure from edema. **Clinical Pearl:** Avoid elevation in suspected compartment syndrome until cleared by the physician. Explain the rationale to the patient."

This follows immediate life- and limb-saving interventions. A fasciotomy involves surgically opening the affected compartment(s) to relieve pressure and restore blood flow. **Clinical Pearl:** Ensure the patient understands the procedure and its potential risks and benefits.

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Assessing the unaffected limb establishes a baseline for comparison. However, it is the lowest priority. The immediate focus is on intervening for the compromised limb. This assessment can be performed once the critical, time-sensitive actions have been completed. Comparing the affected and unaffected limbs helps to differentiate between systemic issues and localized compartment syndrome. **Clinical Pearl:** Document all neurovascular assessments meticulously, including pain level, sensation, motor function, pulse quality, and capillary refill. Use a standardized assessment tool."
