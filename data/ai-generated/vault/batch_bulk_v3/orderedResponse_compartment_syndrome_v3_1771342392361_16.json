    "stem": "A 25-year-old male is in the emergency department after a crush injury to his right forearm at a construction site. A cast was applied two hours ago. The client now reports severe, throbbing pain in the right arm, rating it a 10/10, which is unrelieved by a recent dose of intravenous morphine. The nurse assesses the right hand and finds it is cool, pale, and edematous. The radial pulse is weak and thready, and capillary refill is 4 seconds. The client also reports a 'pins and needles' sensation.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes interventions that address the immediate threat to limb viability. The first priority is to immediately notify the healthcare provider, as acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring a fasciotomy. While awaiting the provider, the nurse's next action is to relieve external pressure by loosening or removing the cast. The limb should then be positioned at the level of the heart to optimize arterial perfusion without increasing edema. Preparing for surgery is the next logical step. Finally, assessing the unaffected limb provides a valuable baseline but is the lowest priority among these critical actions.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these actions can lead to a significant delay in definitive treatment, potentially resulting in irreversible nerve damage, muscle necrosis, and loss of the limb. For example, preparing for surgery or assessing the other limb before notifying the provider and relieving pressure wastes critical time. Elevating the limb, a common intervention for edema, is contraindicated as it would further reduce arterial blood flow and worsen ischemia.",

                "explanation": "This is the absolute first priority. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that requires immediate medical and surgical intervention (fasciotomy) to restore perfusion. The nurse cannot resolve this condition independently, and any delay in notifying the HCP directly increases the risk of permanent neuromuscular damage."

                "explanation": "Immediately after notifying the HCP, the nurse must take action to relieve external pressure on the compartment. A tight cast is a common cause of compartment syndrome. This is a critical, time-sensitive nursing intervention that can help reduce intracompartmental pressure and improve blood flow while awaiting the provider's arrival and further orders."

                "explanation": "The limb should be placed at heart level (not elevated or dependent). Elevation would decrease arterial inflow, worsening ischemia, while a dependent position would increase venous congestion and edema. Positioning at the level of the heart provides a neutral plane that promotes optimal arterial perfusion without exacerbating swelling."

The nurse should ensure the client is NPO (nothing by mouth), confirm IV access, and prepare for informed consent procedures. This is an important step but follows the immediate life- and limb-saving interventions of notifying the provider and relieving pressure."

The immediate focus must be on intervening for the compromised limb. This assessment can be performed once the critical, time-sensitive actions have been completed."
