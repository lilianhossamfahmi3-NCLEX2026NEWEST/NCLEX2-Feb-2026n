        "correct": "The client's presentation of neurological changes (confusion, ataxia, slurred speech, coarse tremors) and gastrointestinal distress (vomiting, diarrhea), combined with elevated BUN and creatinine, points to acute lithium toxicity. The initiation of hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is a classic precipitating factor as it increases sodium excretion, which in turn causes the kidneys to increase reabsorption of lithium, leading to toxic levels. The priority actions are to rehydrate the client with isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) to promote renal excretion of lithium and to place the client on NPO status due to vomiting and decreased level of consciousness to prevent aspiration. The nurse must closely monitor for worsening neurological status (e.g., seizures, coma) and for cardiac dysrhythmias, which are life-threatening complications of severe lithium toxicity.",
        "incorrect": "Other conditions are less likely. Serotonin syndrome typically involves hyperreflexia and fever, which are absent. An acute stroke would not typically present with bilateral tremors and GI symptoms. While hyponatremia can be caused by HCTZ and cause confusion, the client's sodium is only slightly low and does not explain the full clinical picture. Viral gastroenteritis would not account for the specific neurological findings. Incorrect actions either treat a symptom without addressing the cause (antiemetic), are premature (hemodialysis), or unsafe (oral fluids). Monitoring parameters like blood glucose and bowel sounds are not priorities for this life-threatening condition.",
