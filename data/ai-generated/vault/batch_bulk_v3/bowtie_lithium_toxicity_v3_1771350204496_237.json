    "correct": "The client's presentation (altered mental status, ataxia, slurred speech, tremors, vomiting, diarrhea) and lab values (elevated BUN/Creatinine, pending Lithium level, slightly low Sodium) in a client taking Lithium and recently started on Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) strongly suggests Lithium Toxicity. HCTZ, a thiazide diuretic, reduces sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased Lithium reabsorption and potentially toxic levels. \n\n**Actions:**\n*   **Initiate IV access and administer 0.9% sodium chloride:** IV fluids are crucial for rehydration and promoting Lithium excretion through the kidneys. Isotonic saline is the preferred solution.\n*   **Place the client on NPO status:** Due to altered mental status and vomiting, NPO status reduces the risk of aspiration.\n\n**Monitoring:**\n*   **Neurological status:** Lithium toxicity primarily affects the central nervous system. Monitor for worsening confusion, seizures, or decreased level of consciousness.\n*   **Cardiac monitoring:** Lithium toxicity can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring allows for prompt detection and management of any abnormalities.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Thiazide diuretics (like HCTZ) significantly increase the risk of Lithium toxicity. Always assess medication history and renal function when patients on Lithium present with altered mental status or GI symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   **Serotonin Syndrome:** While confusion and tremors can be present, Serotonin Syndrome typically includes hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and fever, which are absent here.\n*   **Acute Stroke:** Stroke is less likely given the bilateral tremors and GI symptoms. Stroke symptoms are typically unilateral.\n*   **Hyponatremia:** While the client's sodium is slightly low, it doesn't fully explain the neurological symptoms. Lithium toxicity is a more likely cause.\n*   **Viral Gastroenteritis:** Gastroenteritis doesn't account for the neurological symptoms like ataxia and slurred speech.\n*   **Administer an antiemetic IV push:** This only treats the symptom of vomiting, not the underlying toxicity.\n*   **Prepare the client for emergent hemodialysis:** Hemodialysis is reserved for severe cases (very high Lithium levels or significant renal impairment). Initial treatment focuses on hydration.\n*   **Administer an oral rehydration solution:** Contraindicated due to altered mental status and vomiting (aspiration risk).\n*   **Urine specific gravity:** Less critical than neurological and cardiac monitoring in this acute situation.\n*   **Blood glucose levels:** Not directly related to Lithium toxicity.\n*   **Bowel sounds:** Less important than assessing for life-threatening neurological and cardiac complications.",
