  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 71-year-old male client on postoperative day 2 following a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The nurse notes the client’s urine output over the past 8 hours has been 150 mL. Assessment reveals 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities and crackles in the bilateral lung bases. The provider is notified and enters new orders after reviewing the following lab results:\n\n- Serum Potassium: 6.8 mEq/L (6.8 mmol/L)\n- Serum Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL (256 mcmol/L)\n- BUN: 58 mg/dL (20.7 mmol/L)\n\nThe nurse must implement the new orders. In what order of priority should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag the actions from the left to the box on the right, placing them in the correct order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest priority).",

      "opt-1": "Administering calcium gluconate is the second priority. **Rationale:** The client's potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L indicates severe hyperkalemia, which poses a significant threat to cardiac function. Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to dysrhythmias. Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart by increasing the threshold potential, stabilizing the myocardial cell membranes and reducing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The IV administration over 5 minutes provides a relatively quick onset of action. **Clinical Pearl:** Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardioprotection but does not address the underlying cause of hyperkalemia.",
      "opt-2": "Placing the client on continuous cardiac monitoring is the highest priority. **Rationale:** The client's elevated potassium level (6.8 mEq/L) indicates hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Hyperkalemia affects the electrical activity of the heart, potentially leading to peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately, ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for immediate detection of these ECG changes, enabling prompt intervention to prevent adverse outcomes. Early identification of dysrhythmias is crucial for timely treatment and improved patient safety. **Clinical Pearl:** Be vigilant for ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia, and have emergency medications and equipment readily available.",
      "opt-3": "Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate is the lowest priority. **Rationale:** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is a cation exchange resin that binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting its excretion through the feces. While effective in lowering potassium levels, its onset of action is slow, typically taking several hours to days. In this acute situation with severe hyperkalemia and signs of fluid overload, more rapid interventions are needed to stabilize the client's cardiac function and address the fluid imbalance. The other interventions provide more immediate relief and are therefore prioritized higher. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client for constipation, as sodium polystyrene sulfonate can cause bowel impaction.",
      "opt-4": "Administering regular insulin with 50% dextrose is the third priority. **Rationale:** The combination of regular insulin and dextrose is used to rapidly shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space, effectively lowering serum potassium levels. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium pump, which transports potassium into cells. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin can lower blood glucose levels. This intervention provides a relatively quick reduction in serum potassium, typically within 30-60 minutes, but it is a temporary measure. It does not eliminate potassium from the body but redistributes it. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client's blood glucose levels closely after administering insulin and dextrose, and be prepared to administer additional dextrose if needed.",
      "opt-5": "Administering furosemide is the fourth priority. **Rationale:** The client exhibits signs of fluid volume overload, including edema and crackles in the lungs, likely exacerbated by the acute kidney injury (AKI). Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes diuresis by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of water and electrolytes, including potassium. While furosemide can help lower potassium levels, its effectiveness is limited in the setting of AKI, especially if the client is oliguric or anuric. It is prioritized after stabilizing the heart and initiating potassium-lowering measures. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client's urine output, electrolytes, and blood pressure closely after administering furosemide, and be aware of potential side effects such as hypokalemia, hypotension, and dehydration."
