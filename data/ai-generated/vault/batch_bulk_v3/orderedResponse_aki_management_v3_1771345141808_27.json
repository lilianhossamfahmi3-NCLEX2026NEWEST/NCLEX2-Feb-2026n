    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 71-year-old male client on postoperative day 2 following a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The nurse notes the client’s urine output over the past 8 hours has been 150 mL. Assessment reveals 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities and crackles in the bilateral lung bases. The provider is notified and enters new orders after reviewing the following lab results:\n\n- Serum Potassium: 6.8 mEq/L (6.8 mmol/L)\n- Serum Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL (256 mcmol/L)\n- BUN: 58 mg/dL (20.7 mmol/L)\n\nThe nurse must implement the new orders. In what order of priority should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag the actions from the left to the box on the right, placing them in the correct order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest priority).",

        "pointToPointRationale": {
            "opt-1": "This is the second priority. After establishing cardiac monitoring, the most immediate life-saving intervention is to stabilize the myocardium. Severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) can lead to fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Calcium gluconate does not lower serum potassium but it antagonizes the toxic cardiac effects of hyperkalemia, providing immediate cardioprotection while other treatments begin to work.",
            "opt-2": "This is the highest priority. The greatest immediate risk for a client with severe hyperkalemia is cardiac arrest due to dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, asystole). Placing the client on a continuous cardiac monitor is the first action to allow for immediate detection of ECG changes (such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex) and life-threatening arrhythmias, ensuring patient safety.",
            "opt-3": "This is the lowest priority among the given options. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation-exchange resin that removes potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract. While essential for definitive potassium removal, its onset of action is slow (several hours). The other interventions address more immediate life threats and are therefore prioritized higher.",
            "opt-4": "This is the third priority. After protecting the heart, the next step is to rapidly lower the serum potassium level. The combination of IV regular insulin and dextrose works quickly (within 15-30 minutes) to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia from the insulin.",
            "opt-5": "This is the fourth priority. The client is exhibiting signs of fluid volume overload (edema, crackles). Administering a loop diuretic like furosemide will help address this by promoting diuresis. It also aids in the excretion of potassium through the kidneys, assuming the client's AKI is not anuric. This action is prioritized after stabilizing the heart and initiating a rapid potassium shift."
