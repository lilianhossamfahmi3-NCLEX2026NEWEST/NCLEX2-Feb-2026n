    "scoringRationale": "The nurse must correctly identify the sequence of pharmacological interventions, appropriate environmental management, and priority monitoring for a client in a pheochromocytoma-induced hypertensive crisis. The correct response demonstrates understanding that alpha-adrenergic blockade (e.g., phentolamine) must be established before initiating beta-blockade to prevent a paradoxical hypertensive crisis from unopposed alpha stimulation. It also recognizes the need to minimize stimuli that could trigger further catecholamine release and prioritizes continuous hemodynamic monitoring due to the client's instability. This combination of actions represents the safest and most effective approach to stabilize the client.",
    "answerBreakdown": {
        "1": {
            "A1": "Correct. Pheochromocytomas secrete excessive catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine), causing intense vasoconstriction. An alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine) is the first-line medication to directly counteract this vasoconstriction and lower the dangerously high blood pressure.",
            "A2": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker first is contraindicated and extremely dangerous. It would block beta-2 mediated vasodilation, leaving alpha-adrenergic receptors unopposed. This results in severe, uncontrolled vasoconstriction and a paradoxical, potentially fatal, rise in blood pressure.",
            "A3": "Incorrect. While calcium channel blockers (e.g., nicardipine) may be used as adjuncts to control blood pressure, they are not the primary, first-line agent to specifically block the effects of excessive catecholamines in a pheochromocytoma crisis. Alpha-blockade is the priority.",
            "A4": "Incorrect. ACE inhibitors work on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This is not the primary pathophysiological pathway causing hypertension in a pheochromocytoma crisis, which is driven by direct catecholamine release. Therefore, it is not the indicated first-line treatment."
        },
        "2": {
            "B1": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker concurrently with the alpha-blocker is unsafe. The alpha-blocker needs time to take effect and establish control over vasoconstriction before beta-blockade is initiated.",
            "B2": "Incorrect. While beta-blockers do treat tachycardia and palpitations, the root cause is the catecholamine surge. Treating the tachycardia first without controlling the blood pressure with an alpha-blocker can lead to a paradoxical hypertensive crisis.",
            "B3": "Correct. This is a critical safety principle in managing pheochromocytoma. Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, esmolol) are used to control reflex tachycardia that often occurs after alpha-blockade is initiated and blood pressure begins to fall. They should only be given once blood pressure is controlled with an alpha-blocker.",
            "B4": "Incorrect. The decision to add a beta-blocker is based on the presence of tachycardia after alpha-blockade has been established, not on a specific blood pressure reading. The goal is to manage heart rate, not primarily blood pressure, with this second medication."
        },
        "3": {
            "C1": "Incorrect. Deep abdominal palpation is absolutely contraindicated. Palpating the abdomen can physically compress the adrenal tumor, triggering a massive and life-threatening release of catecholamines, worsening the hypertensive crisis.",
            "C2": "Incorrect. While emotional support is important, a room full of visitors can increase stress and environmental stimuli (noise, movement), which can precipitate another catecholamine surge. The environment must be controlled and calm.",
            "C3": "Correct. The client is highly sensitive to any form of stress or stimulation (physical, emotional, environmental). A quiet, dark, low-stimulus environment helps prevent the triggering of further catecholamine release from the tumor and is a crucial non-pharmacological intervention.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. Ambulation is a physical stressor that is contraindicated in the acute phase of a hypertensive crisis. The client should be on strict bed rest with minimal activity to prevent exacerbating their condition."
        },
        "4": {
            "D1": "Incorrect. While a neurological assessment is important to monitor for signs of hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke, the primary and most immediate life-threat is cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, continuous hemodynamic monitoring takes precedence.",
            "D2": "Correct. The client is hemodynamically unstable and receiving potent vasoactive medications. Continuous cardiac (ECG) and intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring are essential to titrate medications effectively and immediately detect adverse effects or changes in the client's condition.",
            "D3": "Incorrect. Monitoring intake and output is a standard nursing assessment, but it is not the most urgent priority in this acute, life-threatening situation. Hemodynamic stability is the immediate focus.",
            "D4": "Incorrect. Catecholamines can cause hyperglycemia, so monitoring blood glucose is relevant. However, managing the life-threatening hypertension and tachycardia is the highest priority. Blood glucose can be addressed once the client is hemodynamically stable."
