Positioning the child in high-Fowler's (0°) maximizes lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm, which is crucial given the patient's weakened respiratory muscles due to DMD. Next, titrating oxygen addresses the hypoxemia (SpO2 90%) and ensures adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Assisting with the cough-assist machine is vital for clearing secretions, as DMD impairs the ability to generate an effective cough, increasing the risk of atelectasis and further respiratory compromise.
