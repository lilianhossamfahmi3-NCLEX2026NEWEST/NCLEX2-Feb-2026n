    "question": "A 48-year-old male client is admitted to the emergency department after a flash fire at a shipyard. The nurse performs a primary survey and assesses the extent of the client's burns. The assessment reveals partial and full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk, the full circumference of the right arm, the anterior surface of the left arm, the genitalia, and the posterior surface of the right leg. The client's back has scattered areas of erythema without blistering. Based on these findings, which areas should the nurse include when calculating the total body surface area (TBSA) percentage for fluid resuscitation? Select all that apply.",

The assessment findings specifically state that the *posterior* surface of the right leg was burned, not the anterior surface. Including unburned areas would lead to an inaccurate TBSA and incorrect fluid resuscitation."
