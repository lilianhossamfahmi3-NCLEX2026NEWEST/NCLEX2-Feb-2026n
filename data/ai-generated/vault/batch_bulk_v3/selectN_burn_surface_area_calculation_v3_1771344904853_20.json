  "question": "A 48-year-old male client is admitted to the emergency department at 1400 after a flash fire at a shipyard. The nurse performs a primary survey and assesses the extent of the client's burns. The assessment reveals partial and full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk, the full circumference of the right arm, the anterior surface of the left arm, the genitalia, and the posterior surface of the right leg. The client's back has scattered areas of erythema without blistering. Based on these findings, which areas should the nurse include when calculating the total body surface area (TBSA) percentage for fluid resuscitation? Select all that apply.",

    "title": "TBSA Calculation Rationale",
    "totalTBSA": 41.5,
    "calculationSummary": "The total body surface area (TBSA) is calculated using the Rule of Nines for adults. This calculation is critical for determining fluid resuscitation needs. TBSA calculation only includes partial-thickness (second-degree) and full-thickness (third-degree) burns. Superficial (first-degree) burns are excluded. The Parkland formula (4 mL x TBSA % x body weight in kg) is commonly used to estimate initial fluid requirements.",

        "label": "Full circumference of the right arm",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "scoringWeight": 1,
        "rationale": "Correct. The assessment identifies partial and full-thickness burns to the full circumference of the right arm. According to the Rule of Nines, a full arm accounts for 9% of the TBSA.  Pathophysiology: Partial and full-thickness burns damage the epidermis and dermis, leading to increased capillary permeability and fluid loss. Clinical Pearl: Ensure proper positioning and elevation of the burned extremity to minimize edema formation.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess for circumferential burns, which can lead to compartment syndrome. Monitor distal pulses and capillary refill frequently."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "scoringWeight": 1,
        "rationale": "Correct. The assessment notes burns to the entire anterior trunk. The Rule of Nines allocates 18% of the TBSA to the anterior trunk. Pathophysiology: Damage to the skin barrier results in significant evaporative fluid losses, contributing to hypovolemia. Clinical Pearl: Cover the burned area with sterile dressings to reduce evaporative losses and prevent infection.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Consider early intubation for patients with significant burns to the trunk, as respiratory compromise can develop rapidly."

        "id": "opt_3",
        "label": "Anterior surface of the left arm",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "scoringWeight": 1,
        "rationale": "Correct. The client has burns on the anterior surface of the left arm. This represents half of the total arm surface area, which is calculated as 4.5% of the TBSA. Pathophysiology: Inflammatory mediators released from the burn site cause systemic vasodilation and further exacerbate fluid shifts. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Elevate the affected arm to reduce edema and promote venous return."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "scoringWeight": 1,
        "rationale": "Correct. The scenario specifies burns to the posterior surface of the right leg. The posterior aspect of one leg accounts for 9% of the TBSA. Pathophysiology: Burn injuries disrupt the sodium-potassium pump, leading to intracellular edema and electrolyte imbalances. Clinical Pearl: Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels, particularly sodium and potassium, and replace as needed.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess for deep tissue injury, which may require escharotomy or fasciotomy to relieve pressure."

        "rationale": "Correct. The assessment indicates burns to the genitalia. This area is allocated 1% of the TBSA in the Rule of Nines. Pathophysiology: Genital burns can lead to significant pain, edema, and potential for urinary retention. Clinical Pearl: Ensure proper catheter placement and monitor urine output closely.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Provide meticulous perineal care to prevent infection and promote healing."

        "scoringWeight": -1,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Erythema without blistering indicates a superficial (first-degree) burn. Superficial burns are not included in the TBSA calculation used for determining fluid resuscitation volumes because the skin barrier remains intact and significant fluid shifts do not occur. Pathophysiology: First-degree burns primarily affect the epidermis and cause vasodilation, resulting in redness and pain. Clinical Pearl: Provide symptomatic relief with cool compresses and topical emollients.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Educate the patient on proper sun protection to prevent further damage to the skin."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "scoringWeight": -1,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The nurse must analyze cues precisely. The assessment findings specifically state that the *posterior* surface of the right leg was burned, not the anterior surface. Including unburned areas would lead to an inaccurate TBSA and incorrect fluid resuscitation. Pathophysiology: Inaccurate TBSA calculation can lead to under- or over-resuscitation, both of which can have detrimental effects on patient outcomes. Clinical Pearl: Double-check the burn assessment findings and consult with a burn specialist if needed.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Use a burn diagram to accurately document the location and extent of the burns."
