These include a history of prior suicide attempts (a strong predictor of future attempts), an active plan for suicide with a lethal method, behavioral cues like giving away possessions, cognitive cues like feeling burdensome, and significant physiological changes like rapid weight loss. These cues together paint a picture of a client at imminent risk for self-harm and require immediate implementation of safety protocols and nutritional assessment.",
        "incorrect": "The non-highlighted findings, while important for the overall plan of care, do not represent an immediate threat. Findings like flat affect, psychomotor retardation, and hypersomnia are expected symptoms of major depressive disorder but are not as acute as a suicide plan. Normal findings, such as being alert and oriented or denying hallucinations, are reassuring and do not require immediate negative follow-up.",
