    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate an immediate risk to the client's safety and require prompt intervention. A history of prior suicide attempts is a significant risk factor for future attempts. A specific suicide plan, such as overdosing on sertraline, indicates a high level of intent and increases the risk of self-harm. Giving away prized possessions suggests the client is preparing for death. Expressing feelings of being a burden reflects hopelessness and worthlessness, key components of suicidal ideation. Rapid weight loss due to poor appetite can lead to physiological instability and further exacerbate depressive symptoms. These findings necessitate immediate implementation of safety protocols, continuous monitoring, and a comprehensive assessment by the healthcare team.",
    "incorrect": "The non-highlighted findings, while relevant to the client's overall condition, do not represent an immediate threat to their safety. Flat affect, psychomotor retardation, and hypersomnia are common symptoms of major depressive disorder but do not indicate imminent self-harm. Being alert and oriented and denying hallucinations are positive findings that do not require immediate intervention.",
