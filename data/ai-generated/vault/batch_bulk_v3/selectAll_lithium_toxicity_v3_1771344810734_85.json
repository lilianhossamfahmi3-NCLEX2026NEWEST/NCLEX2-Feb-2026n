The spouse reports the client \"hasn't been themselves\" for the past two days after a bout of gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea. The nurse is performing an initial assessment. Which of the following assessment findings should the nurse recognize as potential cues for lithium toxicity? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "Lithium, a mood stabilizer, has a narrow therapeutic index (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). This client's recent gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea has likely led to dehydration, a significant risk factor for lithium toxicity. Dehydration reduces renal clearance of lithium, causing it to accumulate rapidly in the bloodstream. The kidneys reabsorb lithium in a similar way to sodium; therefore, when sodium levels are low (due to dehydration), the kidneys reabsorb more lithium, leading to increased serum levels. The correct options (ataxia, coarse tremors, muscle weakness, slurred speech, and confusion) are all classic signs of central nervous system (CNS) and neuromuscular impairment associated with elevated lithium levels. These symptoms arise because lithium interferes with neuronal transmission and muscle cell excitability.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent signs of either a different medical condition or subtherapeutic lithium levels. Recognizing the difference is critical for appropriate intervention. Flight of ideas suggests mania (subtherapeutic levels), while severe headache with photophobia and constipation are not characteristic signs of lithium toxicity.",

Ataxia (impaired coordination) and an unsteady gait are significant signs of neurotoxicity caused by elevated lithium levels, specifically affecting cerebellar function.

        "content": "This is incorrect. A common gastrointestinal (GI) sign of early or moderate lithium toxicity is persistent diarrhea, not constipation. The client's recent history of diarrhea from gastroenteritis would have contributed to dehydration, increasing the risk of toxicity. Lithium toxicity often manifests with GI upset due to its irritant effect on the GI mucosa. **-**",
