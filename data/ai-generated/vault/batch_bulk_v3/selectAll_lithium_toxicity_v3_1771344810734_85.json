The spouse reports the client \"hasn't been themselves\" for the past two days after a bout of gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea. The nurse is performing an initial assessment. Which of the following assessment findings should the nurse recognize as potential cues for lithium toxicity? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Dehydration, as experienced by this client from gastroenteritis, is a primary risk factor for developing lithium toxicity because it reduces renal clearance of the drug, causing it to accumulate. The correct options are all classic signs of central nervous system and neuromuscular impairment associated with elevated lithium levels.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent signs of either a different medical condition or subtherapeutic lithium levels. Recognizing the difference is critical for appropriate intervention. Flight of ideas suggests mania (subtherapeutic levels), while severe headache with photophobia and constipation are not characteristic signs of lithium toxicity.",
