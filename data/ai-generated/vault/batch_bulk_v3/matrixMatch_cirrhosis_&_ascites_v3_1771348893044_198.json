        "correct": "The nurse must evaluate outcomes by comparing current data to previous data and expected therapeutic effects. A decrease in abdominal girth and the presence of 2-3 loose stools per day indicate that paracentesis, diuretics, and lactulose are effective. However, the development of hypotension and hyponatremia are significant adverse effects of these treatments, representing a worsening of the client's hemodynamic and electrolyte status. Chronic markers like serum albumin and persistent edema are not expected to resolve quickly and thus represent an unchanged status in the short term.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect evaluations may occur if the nurse misinterprets adverse effects as expected findings or fails to recognize which parameters are expected to change with acute interventions versus those that reflect chronic disease. For example, considering hypotension an expected outcome of fluid removal is incorrect; it is a dangerous complication. Similarly, expecting the serum albumin to improve in two days is unrealistic, as it reflects the liver's long-term synthetic function.",
