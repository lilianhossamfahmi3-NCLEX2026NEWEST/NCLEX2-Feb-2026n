      "rationale": "The highest priority is rapid volume resuscitation to address the profound hypovolemia and hypotension (78/48 mmHg). In Addisonian crisis, adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased aldosterone, causing sodium and water loss, resulting in hypovolemic shock. Rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride restores circulating volume, increasing preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output, thereby improving blood pressure and tissue perfusion. This aligns with the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of emergency care. Without immediate volume replacement, end-organ damage and death can occur.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "rationale": "The second priority is administering IV hydrocortisone. Addisonian crisis results from acute adrenal insufficiency, leading to a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone. Hydrocortisone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, replaces the deficient cortisol, reducing inflammation, supporting blood pressure, and helping to correct electrolyte imbalances. It also has some mineralocorticoid activity, aiding in sodium retention. Early administration of hydrocortisone is critical to reverse the shock state and prevent further deterioration.",

      "optionId": "opt_3",
      "rationale": "The third priority is to correct the severe hypoglycemia (52 mg/dL). Cortisol is essential for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In Addisonian crisis, cortisol deficiency leads to impaired glucose production and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in hypoglycemia. Administering 50% dextrose IV push rapidly increases blood glucose levels, providing the brain with necessary fuel and preventing neurological damage. Untreated hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and death.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "rationale": "The fourth priority is placing the client on a continuous cardiac monitor. Addisonian crisis is characterized by hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency. Aldosterone promotes potassium excretion in the kidneys. Its deficiency leads to potassium retention, potentially causing life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately, ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection and management of these arrhythmias.",

While essential for confirming the diagnosis and guiding ongoing treatment, it should not delay immediate life-saving interventions. The CMP will reveal hyponatremia (due to aldosterone deficiency), hyperkalemia (also due to aldosterone deficiency), hypoglycemia (due to cortisol deficiency), and elevated BUN/creatinine (due to dehydration). The initial treatment is based on the strong clinical suspicion of an Addisonian crisis.",
