    "question": "A 45-year-old client with a history of Addison's disease is brought to the emergency department by their partner. The partner reports the client has had 'a stomach flu' for 3 days with persistent vomiting and has become progressively weaker and confused. The client is lethargic and difficult to arouse.\n\n**Vital Signs**\n*   Temperature: 99.1°F (37.3°C)\n*   Heart Rate: 128/min, thready\n*   Blood Pressure: 78/48 mmHg\n*   Respiratory Rate: 24/min, shallow\n*   SpO2: 94% on room air\n\n**Point-of-Care Glucose:** 52 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L)\n\nThe healthcare provider gives a series of orders to be implemented immediately.",

Rapid infusion of an isotonic fluid like 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to stabilize hemodynamics and ensure perfusion to vital organs, following the principles of airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs)."

This is the definitive treatment that directly addresses the underlying cause of the Addisonian crisis: acute adrenal insufficiency. The corticosteroid is crucial for reversing the shock state, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and stabilizing the client's condition. It should be given immediately after starting fluid resuscitation."

A blood glucose of 52 mg/dL with altered mental status is a medical emergency that can lead to irreversible brain damage or seizures. Administering IV dextrose will rapidly increase blood glucose levels and help improve the client's neurological status."

Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for early detection and management of these arrhythmias, which can occur rapidly as the crisis evolves."

While this is a critical diagnostic step to confirm the severity of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia, and to guide ongoing treatment, the initial life-saving interventions (fluid resuscitation, corticosteroid administration, and glucose correction) should not be delayed while awaiting lab results. The initial treatment is based on the strong clinical suspicion of an Addisonian crisis."
