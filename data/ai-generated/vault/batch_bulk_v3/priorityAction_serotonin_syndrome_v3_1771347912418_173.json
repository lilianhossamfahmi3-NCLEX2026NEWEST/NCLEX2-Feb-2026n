  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of major depressive disorder and migraines, admitted for an elective surgical procedure. The nurse's assessment reveals agitation, confusion, a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure of 172/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, SpO2 of 94% on room air, flushed and diaphoretic skin, muscle rigidity in lower extremities with inducible clonus, and hyperactive bowel sounds. The client states, 'I feel like I'm burning up and my skin is crawling.' The client takes sertraline, trazodone, sumatriptan, and ondansetron. After reviewing the client's record and assessment findings, which action should the nurse take **first**?",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. This is likely due to the combination of sertraline (SSRI) and sumatriptan (triptan), both of which increase serotonin levels. The most immediate threat is the severe hyperthermia (39.5°C/103.1°F). Elevated body temperature can rapidly lead to complications such as rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), metabolic acidosis, and ultimately, organ failure and death. Therefore, the priority nursing action is to initiate active cooling measures to reduce the core body temperature and prevent these irreversible complications. Examples include applying cooling blankets, ice packs to the groin and axillae, and preparing for a cool water bath or lavage. This is a critical independent nursing intervention that directly addresses the most life-threatening aspect of the client's condition.",
    "incorrect": "While withholding serotonergic agents, administering benzodiazepines, and notifying the provider are all essential components of managing serotonin syndrome, they are not the *first* priority. The immediate physiological threat of severe hyperthermia must be addressed first to stabilize the client and prevent end-organ damage. Withholding sertraline prevents further serotonin accumulation but does not treat the acute crisis. Notifying the healthcare provider is crucial for collaborative care and further orders (e.g., cyproheptadine), but it should not delay a life-saving intervention the nurse can perform immediately. Administering lorazepam can help manage agitation and muscle rigidity, but it does not directly address the life-threatening hyperthermia.",

    "content": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity. Key signs and symptoms include hyperthermia, altered mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus, rigidity), and autonomic dysfunction. The mnemonic 'SHIVERS' can help recall the symptoms: Shivering, Hyperreflexia and myoclonus, Increased temperature, Vital sign instability, Encephalopathy, Restlessness, and Sweating. Always consider serotonin syndrome in patients taking serotonergic medications who present with these symptoms. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications and death. Active cooling measures are the priority intervention for hyperthermia. Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that may be used as a specific antidote.",
