        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity. The most immediate threat to life is the severe hyperthermia (39.5°C / 103.1°F). High body temperature can lead to rhabdomyolysis, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and organ failure. Therefore, the priority nursing action is to initiate immediate cooling measures (e.g., applying cooling blankets, cool compresses, or preparing for a cool water bath) to lower the core body temperature and prevent irreversible complications. This is a critical, independent nursing intervention that directly addresses the most life-threatening aspect of the client's condition.",
        "incorrect": "While withholding serotonergic agents, administering benzodiazepines, and notifying the provider are all essential components of managing serotonin syndrome, they are not the first priority. The immediate physiological threat of severe hyperthermia must be addressed first to stabilize the client. Stopping the medication prevents the condition from worsening but doesn't treat the acute crisis. Notifying the HCP is crucial for collaborative care and further orders, but it should not delay a life-saving intervention the nurse can perform immediately. Administering lorazepam helps with agitation and muscle rigidity but does not directly treat the life-threatening hyperthermia.",
