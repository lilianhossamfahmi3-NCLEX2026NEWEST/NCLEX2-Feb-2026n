    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of central diabetes insipidus (DI) following a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. This procedure can disrupt the pituitary gland's ability to produce and release antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to DI. The excessive thirst (polydipsia), high urine output (polyuria), elevated serum sodium (hypernatremia), increased serum osmolality, and low urine specific gravity are all indicative of this condition. In central DI, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine due to the lack of ADH, resulting in massive water loss. This leads to dehydration, hypernatremia, and hypovolemia (as evidenced by the low blood pressure and elevated heart rate). The priority action is to administer desmopressin (DDAVP) at 1400, a synthetic form of ADH. DDAVP will act on the renal tubules to increase water reabsorption, thereby decreasing urine output, increasing urine specific gravity, and correcting the fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This addresses the underlying pathophysiology of the condition and prevents further complications such as severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological sequelae.",
    "incorrect": "Administering 0.9% normal saline (NS) is important for addressing the client's hypovolemia, but it does not treat the underlying cause of the DI. Without ADH, the kidneys will continue to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, rendering the fluid replacement less effective. Initiating seizure precautions is warranted due to the hypernatremia, which increases the risk of seizures. However, this is a preventative measure and does not address the underlying cause of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Notifying the healthcare provider is important, but a standing order exists for desmopressin administration. The nurse should act immediately to stabilize the client before notifying the provider, as the client is exhibiting signs of hemodynamic instability. Delaying treatment could lead to worsening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.",
