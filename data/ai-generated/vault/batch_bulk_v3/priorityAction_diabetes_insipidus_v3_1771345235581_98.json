        "correct": "The client's presentation of polyuria, hypernatremia, high serum osmolality, and low urine specific gravity following pituitary surgery is classic for central diabetes insipidus (DI). This condition is caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The priority action is to administer desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic form of ADH. This medication will directly address the pathophysiology by increasing water reabsorption in the renal tubules, which will decrease urine output, concentrate the urine, and begin to correct the client's hypovolemia (indicated by hypotension and tachycardia) and hypernatremia, thereby stabilizing the client's hemodynamic and electrolyte status.",
        "incorrect": "While the other actions are appropriate and necessary, they are not the immediate priority. Administering IV fluids without first giving desmopressin will not correct the underlying problem, as the fluid will be rapidly excreted. Initiating seizure precautions is a crucial safety measure due to the severe hypernatremia, but it is a preventative action, not a corrective one. Notifying the provider is important, but a standing order is available to treat this emergent and predictable post-operative complication, and immediate intervention to stabilize the patient takes precedence over a phone call.",
