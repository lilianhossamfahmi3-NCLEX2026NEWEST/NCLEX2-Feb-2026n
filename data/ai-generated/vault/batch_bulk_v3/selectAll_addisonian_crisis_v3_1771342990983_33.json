  "stem": "A 45-year-old client with a history of Addison's disease is brought to the emergency department at 1400 with severe weakness, confusion, and nausea. The client's partner reports the client has had influenza-like symptoms for two days and has been unable to tolerate their oral hydrocortisone. The nurse obtains the following initial assessment data:\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Blood Pressure: 82/46 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 128 beats/minute\n- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute\n- Temperature: 100.8°F (38.2°C)\n\n**Point-of-Care Labs:**\n- Serum Sodium: 128 mEq/L\n- Serum Potassium: 6.1 mEq/L\n- Blood Glucose: 54 mg/dL",

    "correct": "The client is experiencing an Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening emergency resulting from acute adrenal insufficiency. This leads to a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone, causing profound hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The priority is to correct these imbalances to prevent irreversible organ damage and death.\n\n*   **Hydrocortisone (A):** Replaces deficient cortisol, addressing the underlying hormonal deficiency. Cortisol is crucial for glucose regulation, blood pressure maintenance, and immune function.\n*   **D5NS (D):** Rapidly restores circulating volume, corrects hypoglycemia, and addresses hyponatremia. The dextrose provides immediate energy, while the normal saline expands intravascular volume, improving blood pressure and tissue perfusion.\n*   **Cardiac Monitoring (C):** Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, ventricular fibrillation). Continuous monitoring allows for early detection and intervention.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Addisonian crisis can be triggered by stress (e.g., infection, surgery, trauma) in individuals with Addison's disease. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect interventions exacerbate the client's electrolyte imbalances or fail to address the underlying pathophysiology.\n\n*   **Spironolactone (B):** A potassium-sparing diuretic, which would worsen the already critical hyperkalemia, potentially leading to fatal cardiac arrhythmias.\n*   **Potassium Chloride (E):** Directly increases serum potassium levels, further endangering the client's cardiac function.\n*   **Low-Sodium Diet (F):** Restricting sodium intake is contraindicated in hyponatremia. The client requires sodium replacement to restore normal fluid balance and blood pressure.",

        "content": "**Correct.** Hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that replaces the deficient cortisol in Addisonian crisis. It helps restore blood pressure, glucose levels, and electrolyte balance.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Hydrocortisone mimics the action of cortisol, a vital hormone produced by the adrenal glands. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands are unable to produce sufficient cortisol, leading to a cascade of physiological imbalances. Administering hydrocortisone intravenously provides immediate replacement, helping to stabilize blood pressure, regulate glucose metabolism, and reduce inflammation. This is a critical intervention in managing Addisonian crisis and preventing life-threatening complications."

        "label": "B",
        "content": "**Incorrect.** Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that promotes sodium and water excretion while retaining potassium. This medication is contraindicated in hyperkalemia as it would further elevate potassium levels, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Spironolactone works by blocking the action of aldosterone in the kidneys, leading to increased sodium and water excretion and potassium retention. In the context of Addisonian crisis, where hyperkalemia is a significant concern, administering spironolactone would exacerbate the electrolyte imbalance and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This medication is typically used in conditions where potassium levels are low or normal, and fluid retention is a problem."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Hyperkalemia affects the electrical activity of the heart, potentially leading to bradycardia, heart blocks, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for real-time assessment of the heart's rhythm and early detection of any abnormalities. This enables the nurse to promptly implement interventions such as administering calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to stabilize the heart and prevent life-threatening complications."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "The combination of 0.9% sodium chloride and 5% dextrose in D5NS provides multiple benefits in managing Addisonian crisis. The normal saline expands the intravascular volume, increasing blood pressure and improving tissue perfusion. The dextrose provides immediate glucose to correct hypoglycemia, which is often present in Addisonian crisis due to cortisol deficiency. The sodium chloride helps to correct hyponatremia, restoring fluid balance and preventing neurological complications."
