The client's partner reports the client has had influenza-like symptoms for two days and has been unable to tolerate their oral hydrocortisone. The nurse obtains the following initial assessment data:\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Blood Pressure: 82/46 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 128 beats/minute\n- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute\n- Temperature: 100.8°F (38.2°C)\n\n**Point-of-Care Labs:**\n- Serum Sodium: 128 mEq/L\n- Serum Potassium: 6.1 mEq/L\n- Blood Glucose: 54 mg/dL",

        "correct": "The client is experiencing an Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening emergency characterized by profound hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia due to acute adrenal insufficiency. Immediate intervention focuses on correcting these imbalances. The priority actions are to replace the deficient glucocorticoid with IV hydrocortisone, rapidly restore circulating volume and correct hypoglycemia/hyponatremia with an isotonic/dextrose solution like D5NS, and monitor for cardiac dysrhythmias caused by severe hyperkalemia.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect interventions include those that would worsen the client's electrolyte imbalances. Administering a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone) or IV potassium would exacerbate the life-threatening hyperkalemia. Sodium restriction is contraindicated as the client is hyponatremic and requires sodium replacement.",
