    "correct": "The client is experiencing refractory hypoxemia, indicated by a PaO2 of 55 mmHg despite an FiO2 of 80%. The elevated plateau pressure (Pplat) of 33 cm H2O suggests the client is at risk for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), specifically volutrauma. ARDS pathophysiology involves inflammation and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to pulmonary edema, alveolar collapse, and decreased lung compliance. This results in ventilation-perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting, causing hypoxemia that is often refractory to increased FiO2 alone. A lung-protective ventilation strategy aims to minimize VILI by using lower tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) to prevent overdistension of alveoli and limiting plateau pressures to <30 cm H2O. Increasing PEEP helps to recruit collapsed alveoli, improve oxygenation, and potentially allow for a reduction in FiO2. Permissive hypercapnia, accepting a PaCO2 higher than normal, is often necessary to achieve these goals, as long as the pH remains above 7.20-7.25. This approach prioritizes lung protection over achieving a 'normal' PaCO2.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing the tidal volume would exacerbate volutrauma and further increase the plateau pressure, worsening lung injury. Increasing FiO2 alone without addressing alveolar recruitment is unlikely to resolve the hypoxemia and increases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Adjusting the respiratory rate primarily affects PaCO2, not PaO2. Attempting to maintain a normal PaCO2 with a low tidal volume would require a high respiratory rate, potentially leading to auto-PEEP and hemodynamic instability. Lowering PaCO2 below normal is not a goal in this situation and could be detrimental.",
