        "correct": "The primary goal of mechanical ventilation in ARDS is to maintain adequate oxygenation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). This is achieved through a lung-protective strategy, which includes: 1) Low tidal volume (4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) to prevent volutrauma and keep plateau pressures <30 cm H2O. 2) Using the lowest possible FiO2 (ideally <0.60) to avoid oxygen toxicity. 3) Applying adequate PEEP to recruit collapsed alveoli, improve oxygenation (PaO2), and allow for FiO2 reduction. The current P/F ratio (55 PaO2 / 0.80 FiO2 = 68.75) indicates severe ARDS, and the plateau pressure of 33 cm H2O is too high, necessitating immediate changes. The correct strategy is to decrease the tidal volume, increase the PEEP to improve oxygenation, and accept a higher-than-normal PaCO2 (permissive hypercapnia) as a consequence of the low tidal volume, as long as the pH remains above 7.20-7.25.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing the tidal volume would worsen lung injury by over-distending the alveoli, leading to higher plateau pressures and volutrauma. Simply increasing the FiO2 without addressing alveolar recruitment with PEEP is ineffective for refractory hypoxemia and increases the risk of oxygen toxicity. While the respiratory rate may be adjusted to manage pH, it is not the primary intervention for severe hypoxemia. Attempting to maintain a normal or low PaCO2 while using a low tidal volume would require an excessively high respiratory rate, leading to air trapping (auto-PEEP) and hemodynamic instability. Therefore, the incorrect options represent strategies that would be harmful or ineffective in this client with severe ARDS.",

Lung-protective strategy mandates a lower tidal volume, typically 4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight, to prevent volutrauma.",
