Priority: Implement seizure precautions and hourly neurologic checks. **Pathophysiology:** In SIADH, excess ADH causes water retention, diluting serum sodium. Severe hyponatremia leads to cellular swelling, especially in the brain, causing cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, predisposing the client to seizures. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for subtle changes in mental status, which can be early indicators of worsening cerebral edema.",

Monitor serum potassium due to potassium-wasting effect. **Pathophysiology:** SIADH causes excessive water retention, leading to increased intravascular volume and pulmonary congestion (crackles). Edema results from increased hydrostatic pressure. Furosemide blocks sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, increasing water excretion but also potassium loss. **Clinical Pearl:** Weigh the client daily at the same time, using the same scale, to accurately assess fluid balance.",

Administer via a central venous catheter using an infusion pump for precise control and to prevent rapid sodium correction, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). **Pathophysiology:** Hypertonic saline increases serum osmolality, drawing fluid from cells into the intravascular space. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause rapid shrinkage of brain cells, leading to demyelination. Central line administration minimizes the risk of extravasation and tissue damage. **Clinical Pearl:** Closely monitor the IV site for signs of infiltration (swelling, redness, pain) every 15-30 minutes during hypertonic saline infusion.",

Initial management: restrict fluid intake to allow serum sodium to rise and serum osmolality to normalize. **Pathophysiology:** ADH increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidneys. This leads to decreased urine output and increased urine concentration. Fluid restriction helps to reduce the dilutional effect and allows the body to regulate sodium levels. **Clinical Pearl:** Educate the client and family about the importance of adhering to the fluid restriction and strategies for managing thirst.",

The primary risk is rapid sodium correction (>8-12 mEq/L in 24 hours), leading to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a severe neurologic condition. Monitor for signs of ODS (new confusion, lethargy, focal deficits). **Pathophysiology:** Conivaptan blocks V1A and V2 vasopressin receptors, reducing water reabsorption in the kidneys. Rapid sodium correction can cause rapid shrinkage of brain cells, leading to demyelination, particularly in the pons. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor serum sodium levels frequently (e.g., every 4-6 hours) during conivaptan therapy to detect and prevent rapid correction.",
