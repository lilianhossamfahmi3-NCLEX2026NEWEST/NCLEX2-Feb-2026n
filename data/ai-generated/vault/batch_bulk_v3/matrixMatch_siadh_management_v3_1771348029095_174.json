This requires understanding the pathophysiology of severe hyponatremia (risk for seizures), fluid volume excess (need for diuretics), the safe administration of high-risk medications (hypertonic saline), the cornerstone of conservative management (fluid restriction), and the risks associated with vasopressin antagonists (osmotic demyelination syndrome from rapid sodium correction).",
        "incorrect": "Incorrectly matching findings with actions can lead to patient harm. For example, failing to implement seizure precautions for severe hyponatremia could result in an unwitnessed seizure and injury. Administering hypertonic saline incorrectly can cause fluid overload or central pontine myelinolysis. Not restricting fluids when indicated would worsen the hyponatremia. Failure to monitor for complications of specific medications demonstrates a lack of essential safety knowledge.",
