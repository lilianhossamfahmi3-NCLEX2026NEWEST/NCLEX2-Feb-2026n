The spouse reports the client has had 'a stomach bug' with diarrhea for two days and seems increasingly unsteady and confused. The client was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. The nurse reviews the client's presentation and anticipates potential lithium toxicity. \n\n**For each clinical finding, click to specify if it is an expected side effect, a sign of mild toxicity, or a sign of moderate to severe toxicity.**",

        "prompt": "The nurse must recognize and categorize clinical manifestations associated with lithium therapy. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range (typically 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Levels above this range lead to toxicity, which progresses from mild to severe as levels increase. The client's recent gastroenteritis (diarrhea) and new prescription for a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) are significant risk factors for dehydration and sodium depletion, both of which decrease renal clearance of lithium and precipitate toxicity.",

Persistent gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, is an early and classic sign of mild lithium toxicity, typically seen with serum levels of 1.5-2.0 mEq/L. While mild GI upset can occur initially with therapy, its persistence or new onset suggests toxicity."

                "rationale": "Correct. As lithium levels rise into the mild toxicity range (1.5-2.0 mEq/L), the expected fine hand tremors progress to coarse hand tremors. This change is a key indicator that the client has moved from a therapeutic state to a toxic one."

Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and blurred vision are serious signs of central nervous system and ocular toxicity associated with moderate to severe lithium levels (above 2.0 mEq/L). These symptoms, along with others like ataxia and seizures, warrant aggressive treatment."
