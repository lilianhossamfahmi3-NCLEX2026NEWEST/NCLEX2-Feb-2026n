  "question": "A 48-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder, maintained on lithium carbonate for the past five years, is brought to the emergency department by their spouse. The spouse reports the client has had 'a stomach bug' with diarrhea for two days and seems increasingly unsteady and confused. The client was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. The nurse reviews the client's presentation and anticipates potential lithium toxicity. \n\n**For each clinical finding, click to specify if it is an expected side effect, a sign of mild toxicity, or a sign of moderate to severe toxicity.**",

    "prompt": "The nurse must recognize and categorize clinical manifestations associated with lithium therapy. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range (typically 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Levels above this range lead to toxicity, which progresses from mild to severe as levels increase. The client's recent gastroenteritis (diarrhea) and new prescription for a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) are significant risk factors for dehydration and sodium depletion, both of which decrease renal clearance of lithium and precipitate toxicity.",

Persistent gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, is an early and classic sign of mild lithium toxicity, typically seen with serum levels of 1.5-2.0 mEq/L.

  "clinicalPearls": "Lithium toxicity is a risk for clients on lithium, especially with dehydration or changes in sodium levels. Thiazide diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide can decrease lithium clearance, increasing the risk of toxicity. Early recognition of symptoms is crucial to prevent severe complications. Monitor lithium levels regularly and educate clients about signs and symptoms of toxicity.",
  "pathophysiology": "Lithium, a mood stabilizer, has a narrow therapeutic index. Dehydration and sodium depletion, often caused by diarrhea and diuretics, lead to increased lithium reabsorption in the kidneys, reducing its clearance and causing serum levels to rise rapidly. Elevated lithium levels disrupt neuronal function, leading to neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe toxicity can cause seizures, coma, and irreversible neurological damage.",
