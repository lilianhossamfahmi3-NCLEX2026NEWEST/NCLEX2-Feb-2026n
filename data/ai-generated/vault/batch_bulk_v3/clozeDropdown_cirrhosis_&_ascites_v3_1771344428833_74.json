    "correct": "The correct plan of care prioritizes daily weights and abdominal girth measurements as the most reliable indicators of fluid shifts in ascites. It correctly identifies a sodium restriction (<2,000 mg/day) as the primary dietary intervention to limit fluid retention. The use of intravenous 25% albumin is appropriate to increase intravascular oncotic pressure, pulling fluid from the peritoneum for excretion, especially given the client's hypoalbuminemia (2.4 g/dL). Finally, if conservative measures fail to alleviate respiratory distress caused by tense ascites, a therapeutic paracentesis is the indicated procedure to mechanically remove fluid and relieve pressure on the diaphragm.",
    "incorrect": "Other combinations are incorrect. Intake and output monitoring is less accurate due to insensible losses and third-spacing. Fluid restriction is a secondary measure for severe hyponatremia, not the initial step. Protein restriction is contraindicated as it worsens malnutrition. Lactulose treats encephalopathy, not low oncotic pressure. While furosemide and spironolactone are used, albumin is specifically used to address the oncotic pressure deficit. Thoracentesis is for pleural effusions, a liver biopsy is diagnostic, and a TIPS procedure is a more invasive option for refractory ascites, not the immediate next step for acute respiratory distress.",
