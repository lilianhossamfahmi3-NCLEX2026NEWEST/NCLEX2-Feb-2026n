    "prompt": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old male who weighs 80 kg (176 lb). He was brought in after an electrical flash burn from a malfunctioning generator at a construction site. The client is awake and alert but disoriented to time and place. The assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering his entire anterior torso and partial-thickness burns covering his entire right arm. There is no evidence of soot in the nares or singed facial hair. Vital signs are: Blood pressure 92/58 mmHg, Heart rate 128 beats/minute, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute, SpO2 96% on room air.",
