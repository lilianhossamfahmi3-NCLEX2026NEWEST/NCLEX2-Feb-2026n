  "prompt": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old male who weighs 80 kg (176 lb). He was brought in after an electrical flash burn from a malfunctioning generator at a construction site. The client is awake and alert but disoriented to time and place. The assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering his entire anterior torso and partial-thickness burns covering his entire right arm. There is no evidence of soot in the nares or singed facial hair. Vital signs are: Blood pressure 92/58 mmHg, Heart rate 128 beats/minute, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute, SpO2 96% on room air.",

This leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, resulting in decreased circulating blood volume. The inflammatory response further exacerbates this process. The client's 27% TBSA burn (18% anterior torso full-thickness + 9% right arm partial-thickness) is sufficient to trigger this systemic response. The resulting hypotension (92/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (128 bpm) are compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output in the face of reduced preload. Without intervention, this can lead to end-organ damage and death.",

Inhalation injury impairs gas exchange and can lead to respiratory failure.",

The massive fluid shift in burn shock leads to intravascular volume depletion, requiring rapid and aggressive fluid replacement.

This helps restore circulating blood volume and improve tissue perfusion. The Parkland formula (4 mL x %TBSA x body weight in kg) is used to estimate the initial fluid resuscitation needs. Half of the calculated volume is administered in the first 8 hours from the time of the burn, and the remaining half is administered over the next 16 hours.",
