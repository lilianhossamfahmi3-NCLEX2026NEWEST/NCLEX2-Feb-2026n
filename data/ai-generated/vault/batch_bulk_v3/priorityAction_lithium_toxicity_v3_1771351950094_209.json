The client exhibits signs of lithium toxicity (confusion, coarse tremors, ataxia, vomiting) exacerbated by hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic. HCTZ induces sodium and water loss, prompting increased lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, elevating serum lithium levels. Vomiting and diuretic use contribute to dehydration, evidenced by tachycardia (112 bpm) and hypotension (104/62 mmHg). Administering isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) addresses dehydration, enhances renal blood flow, and promotes lithium excretion by providing sodium for reabsorption in place of lithium within the renal tubules. This intervention is critical to stabilize the client and prevent further neurological decline. Clinical Pearl: Monitor serum sodium levels closely during IV fluid administration, as rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. SBAR: Situation: 58-year-old male with bipolar I disorder presenting with confusion, tremors, and ataxia. Background: History of bipolar I disorder, taking lithium and recently started on hydrochlorothiazide. Assessment: Disoriented, coarse tremors, unsteady gait, vomiting, HR 112, BP 104/62.
