The client's presentation (confusion, coarse tremors, ataxia, vomiting) combined with the recent initiation of hydrochlorothiazide strongly suggests lithium toxicity. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, increases sodium excretion, which in turn causes the kidneys to increase reabsorption of lithium, leading to toxic levels. The client is also likely dehydrated from vomiting and the diuretic, as evidenced by tachycardia and hypotension. Administering isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is the cornerstone of initial management. It addresses dehydration, improves renal blood flow, and promotes the renal excretion of lithium by providing sodium that will be reabsorbed in place of lithium in the renal tubules. This is a critical, life-saving intervention that addresses the underlying pathophysiology."

Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting lab results, which could take a significant amount of time. The nurse must act on the strong clinical evidence to stabilize the client and prevent further deterioration."
