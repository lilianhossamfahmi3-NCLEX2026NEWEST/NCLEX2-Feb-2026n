    "question": "A nurse is creating the initial plan of care for a 28-year-old client admitted for an acute manic episode of bipolar I disorder. The client is pacing, speaking rapidly with flight of ideas, and has not eaten for 24 hours. The nurse determines the most appropriate initial interventions. \n\nThe nurse will first {{1}}. To manage the therapeutic environment, the nurse will {{2}}. For client communication and safety, the nurse's priority is to {{3}}.",

            "Restrict oral intake until the client can sit calmly at a table.",

    ],
    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The correct plan addresses the client's immediate physiological and safety needs during an acute manic episode. Providing high-calorie, high-protein finger foods accommodates the client's hyperactivity and inability to sit for meals, preventing nutritional deficits and dehydration. Decreasing environmental stimuli with a private room near the nurses' station reduces the risk of escalating agitation while ensuring close observation for safety. Setting clear, firm, and consistent limits provides external control and structure, which is crucial for a client with impaired judgment and impulse control, thereby ensuring safety for the client and others on the unit.",
        "incorrect": "Other options are incorrect because they either fail to meet the client's immediate needs or could potentially escalate the client's manic symptoms. Structured meals are unrealistic for a client with psychomotor agitation. Restricting intake is punitive and unsafe. Large group activities or assigning a roommate would be overstimulating and could lead to conflict. Seclusion is a last resort, not an initial intervention. Attempting to argue with delusions, using touch which may be misinterpreted, or ignoring potentially unsafe behaviors are all counter-therapeutic and potentially dangerous approaches.",

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect and unsafe. Withholding food is punitive and will worsen the client's physiological state, which is already compromised by hyperactivity and poor intake. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and physical exhaustion."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the correct intervention. Clients in a manic state have high energy expenditure and are often too distracted or agitated to sit for a full meal. Portable, high-density foods (like sandwiches, cheese sticks, milkshakes) can be consumed 'on the go' and help meet the client's increased metabolic and nutritional needs."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect because a client with acute mania lacks the concentration and impulse control to sit through a structured meal. The dining hall environment is highly stimulating and would likely increase agitation and distractibility, making it impossible for the client to eat."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect because while carbohydrates provide energy, the client also requires adequate protein for tissue maintenance and fat for essential fatty acids and calorie density. The priority is high-calorie, high-protein intake to compensate for the catabolic state of mania."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect and unsafe. A client with acute mania is often intrusive, irritable, and has poor boundaries, which poses a significant risk of conflict and potential harm to a roommate. The priority is safety and a low-stimulus environment."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. Seclusion is a highly restrictive intervention used only as a last resort when a client poses an imminent danger to self or others and less restrictive measures have failed. It is not a standard or initial intervention upon admission."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. A client in an acute manic state is not capable of logical reasoning about their grandiose delusions. Challenging or attempting to argue with these beliefs is ineffective and will likely increase the client's frustration, agitation, and paranoia."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Clients with mania often have blurred personal boundaries and may misinterpret touch as threatening, aggressive, or sexual in nature. This can provoke an agitated or violent response. The nurse should maintain personal space."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. While planned ignoring can be a useful technique for attention-seeking behaviors, it is inappropriate for intrusive or manipulative behaviors in mania. Ignoring these behaviors fails to provide necessary limits and can escalate the behavior as the client seeks a response, compromising safety."
