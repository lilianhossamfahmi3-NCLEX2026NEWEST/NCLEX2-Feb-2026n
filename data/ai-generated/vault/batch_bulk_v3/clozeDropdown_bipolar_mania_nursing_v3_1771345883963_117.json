  "question": "A nurse is creating the initial plan of care for a 28-year-old client admitted at 1400 for an acute manic episode of bipolar I disorder. The client is pacing, speaking rapidly with flight of ideas, and has not eaten for 24 hours. The nurse determines the most appropriate initial interventions.\n\nThe nurse will first {{1}}. To manage the therapeutic environment, the nurse will {{2}}. For client communication and safety, the nurse's priority is to {{3}}.",
  "options": [
    [
      "Restrict oral intake until the client can sit calmly at a table.",
      "Provide high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and drinks.",

  "answer": [
    "Provide high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and drinks.",
    "Decrease environmental stimuli by assigning a private room near the nurses' station.",
    "Set clear, consistent, and firm limits on behavior in a calm tone."
  ],
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct plan addresses the client's immediate physiological and safety needs during an acute manic episode. Providing high-calorie, high-protein finger foods accommodates the client's hyperactivity and inability to sit for meals, preventing nutritional deficits and dehydration. Decreasing environmental stimuli with a private room near the nurses' station reduces the risk of escalating agitation while ensuring close observation for safety. Setting clear, firm, and consistent limits provides external control and structure, which is crucial for a client with impaired judgment and impulse control, thereby ensuring safety for the client and others on the unit. In acute mania, the client's brain is in a state of hyperactivation, leading to increased dopamine and norepinephrine levels. This neurochemical imbalance contributes to the characteristic symptoms of elevated mood, racing thoughts, and increased energy. Providing adequate nutrition helps stabilize blood sugar levels and supports brain function. A calm environment reduces external stimulation, preventing further exacerbation of the manic state. Clear limits provide a sense of security and predictability, counteracting the client's impulsivity.",
    "incorrect": "Other options are incorrect because they either fail to meet the client's immediate needs or could potentially escalate the client's manic symptoms. Structured meals are unrealistic for a client with psychomotor agitation. Restricting intake is punitive and unsafe. Large group activities or assigning a roommate would be overstimulating and could lead to conflict. Seclusion is a last resort, not an initial intervention. Attempting to argue with delusions, using touch which may be misinterpreted, or ignoring potentially unsafe behaviors are all counter-therapeutic and potentially dangerous approaches.",

        "label": "Blank 1, Option A",
        "content": "Restrict oral intake until the client can sit calmly at a table.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect and unsafe. Withholding food is punitive and will worsen the client's physiological state, which is already compromised by hyperactivity and poor intake. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and physical exhaustion. In mania, the body's metabolic rate is significantly increased due to constant activity. Restricting intake exacerbates this imbalance, potentially leading to life-threatening complications."

        "label": "Blank 1, Option B",
        "content": "Provide high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and drinks.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the correct intervention. Clients in a manic state have high energy expenditure and are often too distracted or agitated to sit for a full meal. Portable, high-density foods (like sandwiches, cheese sticks, milkshakes) can be consumed 'on the go' and help meet the client's increased metabolic and nutritional needs. The increased energy expenditure in mania is driven by the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Providing readily available calories and protein helps to fuel this increased metabolic demand and prevent catabolism."

        "label": "Blank 1, Option C",
        "content": "Schedule three structured meals per day in the dining hall.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect because a client with acute mania lacks the concentration and impulse control to sit through a structured meal. The dining hall environment is highly stimulating and would likely increase agitation and distractibility, making it impossible for the client to eat. The sensory overload in a dining hall can overwhelm the client's already heightened state of arousal, leading to increased anxiety and agitation. This can further disrupt their ability to focus and eat."

        "label": "Blank 1, Option D",
        "content": "Offer a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to promote energy.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect because while carbohydrates provide energy, the client also requires adequate protein for tissue maintenance and fat for essential fatty acids and calorie density. The priority is high-calorie, high-protein intake to compensate for the catabolic state of mania. Protein is essential for repairing and building tissues, which is particularly important during the catabolic state of mania. Fat provides essential fatty acids and contributes to overall calorie density, ensuring adequate energy intake."

        "label": "Blank 2, Option A",
        "content": "Set clear, consistent, and firm limits on behavior in a calm tone.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the correct intervention. Clients with mania have poor impulse control and judgment. Providing clear, firm limits on behavior (e.g., intrusiveness, manipulation) in a neutral, non-judgmental tone provides structure and security, ensuring safety for the client and others on the unit. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions like impulse control and judgment, is often impaired in mania. Setting external limits helps compensate for this deficit, providing a framework for appropriate behavior."

        "label": "Blank 2, Option B",
        "content": "Engage in a lengthy discussion to logically disprove the client's grandiose thoughts.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect. A client in an acute manic state is not capable of logical reasoning about their grandiose delusions. Challenging or attempting to argue with these beliefs is ineffective and will likely increase the client's frustration, agitation, and paranoia. Grandiose delusions are often a manifestation of altered dopamine pathways in the brain. Attempting to reason with the client will not alter these underlying neurochemical imbalances and may instead escalate their agitation."

      {
        "label": "Blank 2, Option C",
        "content": "Use therapeutic touch frequently to provide comfort and reassurance.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Clients with mania often have blurred personal boundaries and may misinterpret touch as threatening, aggressive, or sexual in nature. This can provoke an agitated or violent response. The nurse should maintain personal space. The heightened sensory sensitivity in mania can lead to misinterpretation of physical touch. The client may perceive touch as intrusive or threatening, triggering a defensive response."

        "label": "Blank 2, Option D",
        "content": "Decrease environmental stimuli by assigning a private room near the nurses' station.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This is the correct intervention. A low-stimulus environment helps to decrease agitation and anxiety. A private room minimizes external provocations. Placing it near the nurses' station is crucial for frequent, unobtrusive observation to ensure the client's safety. The overstimulation of the brain in mania can be exacerbated by external stimuli. Reducing environmental distractions helps to calm the client's nervous system and prevent further escalation of symptoms."

        "label": "Blank 3, Option A",
        "content": "Encourage participation in a large group therapy session to promote insight.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect and contraindicated in acute mania. The high level of social and auditory stimulation in a large group setting would overwhelm the client, likely escalating agitation, irritability, and disruptive behavior. The amygdala, responsible for processing emotions, is often hyperactive in mania. Exposure to a large group setting can trigger an overwhelming emotional response, leading to increased agitation and disruptive behavior."

        "label": "Blank 3, Option B",
        "content": "Assign a roommate to prevent social isolation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect and unsafe. A client with acute mania is often intrusive, irritable, and has poor boundaries, which poses a significant risk of conflict and potential harm to a roommate. The priority is safety and a low-stimulus environment. The impaired judgment and impulsivity in mania can lead to boundary violations and conflicts with others. Assigning a roommate increases the risk of harm to both the client and the roommate."

        "label": "Blank 3, Option C",
        "content": "Place the client in a seclusion room immediately upon admission.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect. Seclusion is a highly restrictive intervention used only as a last resort when a client poses an imminent danger to self or others and less restrictive measures have failed. It is not a standard or initial intervention upon admission. Seclusion should only be used when all other interventions have failed to de-escalate the client's behavior and they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. It is a restrictive measure that can have negative psychological effects."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "This is incorrect. This option is more appropriate for managing the therapeutic environment, not for direct client communication and safety. While a low-stimulus environment contributes to safety, the priority for communication is setting limits."
