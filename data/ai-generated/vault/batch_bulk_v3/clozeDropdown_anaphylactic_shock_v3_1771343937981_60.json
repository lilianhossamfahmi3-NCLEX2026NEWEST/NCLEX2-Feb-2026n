    "correct": "The correct sequence of actions follows the standard algorithm for managing anaphylactic shock. The absolute priority is administering intramuscular epinephrine to reverse life-threatening bronchoconstriction and vasodilation. This is followed by establishing IV access for rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride to treat profound hypotension from distributive shock. The client should be placed in a supine position with legs elevated to maximize venous return and cardiac output. High-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is essential to correct hypoxia. Finally, an inhaled beta-agonist like albuterol is an appropriate adjunctive therapy for persistent wheezing.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either delay the most critical life-saving intervention (epinephrine), select inappropriate fluids or medications that could worsen the client's condition (e.g., D5W, furosemide), or choose suboptimal positioning or oxygen delivery methods for the severity of the client's shock and respiratory distress.",

Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies.  When an allergen binds to IgE on mast cells and basophils, it triggers the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. These mediators cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus production. Epinephrine's alpha-adrenergic effects reverse vasodilation and decrease angioedema by constricting blood vessels and reducing leakage. Its beta-adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and increase myocardial contractility, improving cardiac output.  The IM route allows for rapid absorption and distribution.",
