        "correct": "The most critical trend is the rapid decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) from 2.8 L to 1.4 L over 72 hours. In Guillain-Barre Syndrome, ascending paralysis affects the intercostal muscles and diaphragm. A significant drop in FVC (especially below 15-20 mL/kg or <1.5 L) indicates impending respiratory failure. The client's increasing respiratory rate, shallow breathing, and drop in SpO2 corroborate this finding. This situation is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, likely including preparation for elective intubation and mechanical ventilation, to prevent respiratory arrest.",
        "incorrect": "While labile blood pressure, ascending weakness, and areflexia are classic signs of GBS, they do not represent the most immediate life-threatening complication. Autonomic dysfunction causes blood pressure lability and is managed with monitoring and medication. Ascending weakness and loss of reflexes are the expected pathological progression of the disease. The primary threat to life in the acute phase of GBS is respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, which is most directly and sensitively measured by serial FVC measurements.",
