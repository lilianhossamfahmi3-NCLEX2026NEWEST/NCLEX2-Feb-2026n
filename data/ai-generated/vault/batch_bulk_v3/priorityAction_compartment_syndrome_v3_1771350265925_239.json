    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 34-year-old client who had a long arm cast applied 6 hours ago for a closed fracture of the right radius and ulna. The client has received two doses of IV morphine, but reports their pain has increased from a 7/10 to a 9/10. The nurse's assessment reveals swelling of the fingers, a capillary refill of 4 seconds on the right hand, and the client reports a new onset of 'pins and needles' sensation. The right radial pulse is palpable but weak compared to the left.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of acute compartment syndrome (pain unrelieved by analgesics, paresthesia, pallor, pulselessness, and swelling), which is a limb-threatening emergency. The nurse's priority is to notify the HCP immediately. This condition is caused by increased pressure within a fascial compartment, which compromises circulation and nerve function. Immediate intervention, such as a fasciotomy, is required to relieve the pressure and prevent permanent neuromuscular damage. The nurse cannot resolve this independently, making immediate escalation the most critical action.",
        "incorrect": "Administering more morphine is dangerous as it can mask the progression of symptoms and delays definitive treatment. Pain that is out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by opioids is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it can further decrease arterial perfusion to the already ischemic tissues, worsening the condition. While loosening a tight dressing could be a helpful measure, it is not the priority over notifying the HCP, who must direct care and prepare for potential surgical intervention. Delaying notification for any other action can lead to irreversible damage.",

While an overly tight cast or wrap can contribute to compartment syndrome, and loosening it is a reasonable intervention, the priority is to alert the HCP.
