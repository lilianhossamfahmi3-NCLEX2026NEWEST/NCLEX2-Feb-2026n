  "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 34-year-old client who had a long arm cast applied 6 hours ago for a closed fracture of the right radius and ulna. The client has received two doses of IV morphine, but reports their pain has increased from a 7/10 to a 9/10. The nurse's assessment reveals swelling of the fingers, a capillary refill of 4 seconds on the right hand, and the client reports a new onset of 'pins and needles' sensation. The right radial pulse is palpable but weak compared to the left.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of acute compartment syndrome, a limb-threatening emergency. The priority is to notify the HCP immediately. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a confined fascial space compromises blood flow and nerve function. The '6 Ps' (Pain out of proportion, Paresthesia, Pallor, Paralysis, Pulselessness, Pressure) are key indicators. In this case, escalating pain despite analgesics, swelling, paresthesia, and diminished pulse suggest compromised circulation. Immediate intervention, potentially including a fasciotomy, is needed to relieve pressure and prevent permanent neuromuscular damage. Delaying notification for other actions can lead to irreversible tissue damage. ClinicalPearl: Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial in managing compartment syndrome to prevent long-term complications.",
    "incorrect": "Administering more morphine is dangerous as it can mask worsening symptoms and delay definitive treatment. Pain unrelieved by opioids is a hallmark of compartment syndrome. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it can further decrease arterial perfusion to already ischemic tissues, worsening the condition. While loosening the ACE wrap might be helpful, it's not the priority over notifying the HCP, who must direct care and prepare for potential surgical intervention. Delaying notification can lead to irreversible damage. ClinicalPearl: Remember that pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a red flag for compartment syndrome.",

Prepare to provide further assessment data and anticipate orders for potential interventions, including possible fasciotomy.
