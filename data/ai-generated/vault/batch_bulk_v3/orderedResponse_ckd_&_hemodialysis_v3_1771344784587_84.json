        "correct": "The correct sequence ensures patient safety and adherence to evidence-based practice for hemodialysis initiation. The nurse first establishes a baseline by obtaining weight and vital signs. Next, the patency of the access is confirmed by assessing for a bruit and thrill. Proper infection control is performed by cleansing the site before cannulation. After cannulation, the circuit is established by connecting the bloodlines. Finally, anticoagulation is administered to prevent clotting in the circuit once blood flow is initiated.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence compromises patient safety or procedural integrity. For example, cannulating before assessing for a bruit and thrill risks attempting to use a clotted, non-functional access. Failing to obtain baseline weight and vitals first prevents accurate calculation of fluid removal goals and makes it difficult to assess for hemodynamic instability during treatment. Administering heparin before the circuit is connected could lead to systemic anticoagulation without the intended effect in the dialysis machine.",

                "explanation": "This is the first step. Obtaining pre-dialysis weight is critical for calculating the ultrafiltration goal (fluid to be removed), and baseline vital signs are essential for monitoring hemodynamic stability throughout the treatment, as hypotension is a common complication."

                "explanation": "This step is crucial for assessing the patency and function of the vascular access. The presence of a bruit (a 'whooshing' sound) and a thrill (a palpable vibration) indicates adequate blood flow through the fistula. This must be confirmed before proceeding with cannulation."

                "explanation": "This infection control measure is performed immediately before breaking the skin. Cleansing the site with an agent like chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine reduces the microbial load and minimizes the risk of access-related bloodstream infections, a major cause of morbidity in hemodialysis patients."

                "explanation": "After confirming access patency and performing skin antisepsis, the nurse can proceed with the invasive step of cannulation.
