    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes patient safety and evidence-based practice. Obtaining baseline data (weight, vital signs) is crucial for monitoring and calculating fluid removal. Assessing the AV fistula ensures patency before invasive procedures. Aseptic technique minimizes infection risk. Connecting bloodlines after cannulation establishes the extracorporeal circuit. Heparin prevents clotting within the circuit.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences can compromise patient safety. Cannulating a clotted fistula can cause damage. Skipping baseline data hinders accurate fluid management and complication detection. Premature heparin administration can cause systemic anticoagulation without circuit benefit.",

        "explanation": "Pre-dialysis weight establishes the ultrafiltration goal (fluid removal). Baseline vital signs (BP, HR, temp, RR, O2 sat) are essential for monitoring hemodynamic stability. Hypotension is a common complication due to rapid fluid shifts. Accurate weight measurement is crucial for preventing excessive fluid removal, which can lead to hypovolemia and cardiovascular compromise."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "A bruit (turbulent blood flow sound) and thrill (palpable vibration) indicate fistula patency. Absence suggests clotting or stenosis, rendering the fistula unusable. Stenosis reduces blood flow, compromising dialysis effectiveness. Palpation and auscultation assess the integrity of the anastomosis between the artery and vein, ensuring adequate blood flow for dialysis. If absent, notify the provider immediately."

        "explanation": "Skin antisepsis (e.g., chlorhexidine gluconate) reduces the risk of access-related bloodstream infections (ARBSIs). ARBSIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Proper cleansing technique involves friction and adequate contact time with the antiseptic agent to maximize microbial kill. Allow the antiseptic to dry completely before cannulation."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Cannulation establishes access to the bloodstream for dialysis. The arterial needle draws blood to the dialyzer, and the venous needle returns dialyzed blood. Proper needle placement avoids recirculation (dialyzed blood immediately re-entering the arterial line), which reduces dialysis efficiency. Angle of insertion and depth are critical to prevent damage to the fistula."

        "explanation": "Connecting the bloodlines completes the extracorporeal circuit, allowing blood to flow from the patient to the dialyzer and back. Ensure proper connection to avoid air embolism or blood leakage. The bloodlines are primed with saline to remove air and prevent air embolism. Check connections for leaks before initiating blood flow."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents clotting within the extracorporeal circuit during dialysis. Clotting can obstruct blood flow and reduce dialysis efficiency. Heparin is administered after the circuit is connected to ensure it anticoagulates the blood within the dialyzer and bloodlines. Monitor for signs of bleeding during and after dialysis."
