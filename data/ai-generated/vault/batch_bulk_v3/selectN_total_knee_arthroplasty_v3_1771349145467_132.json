    "introduction": "The nurse is creating a post-operative plan of care for a client following a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The plan should address key areas such as preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), promoting respiratory function, facilitating early mobilization, and monitoring for neurovascular compromise to optimize recovery and minimize complications.",
    "options": [
      {
        "id": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Correct. Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is a prophylactic anticoagulant prescribed to prevent VTE, a significant risk following major orthopedic surgeries like TKA. TKA increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to surgical trauma, immobility, and hypercoagulability. Enoxaparin inhibits clotting factors, reducing the risk of thrombus formation.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "clinicalPearl": "Administer enoxaparin at the same time each day, typically in the abdomen, rotating injection sites. Monitor for signs of bleeding, such as hematuria, melena, epistaxis, or excessive bruising. Teach the client and family about bleeding precautions.",
        "pathophysiology": "TKA causes endothelial damage and venous stasis, activating the coagulation cascade. Enoxaparin binds to antithrombin III, enhancing its inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin, thereby preventing clot formation."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Placing a pillow directly under the operative knee promotes knee flexion, which can lead to a flexion contracture, hindering full extension and impacting long-term mobility. Flexion also compresses the popliteal vessels, increasing the risk of VTE. Maintaining the knee in extension is crucial for optimal healing and function.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "clinicalPearl": "Maintain the knee in full extension as much as possible. A small towel roll placed under the ankle can help achieve this without causing pressure on the popliteal space.",
        "pathophysiology": "Prolonged knee flexion shortens the posterior knee structures (ligaments, tendons, capsule), leading to a fixed flexion deformity. Popliteal compression impairs venous return, predisposing to DVT."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Correct. Incentive spirometry promotes deep breathing and lung expansion, preventing atelectasis and pneumonia, common post-operative complications. Anesthesia, pain, and immobility can lead to shallow breathing and mucus accumulation in the lungs. Deep breathing exercises help clear secretions and improve oxygenation.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "clinicalPearl": "Instruct the client to exhale completely, seal their lips around the mouthpiece, inhale slowly and deeply, hold their breath for 3-5 seconds, and exhale slowly. Repeat 10 times per hour while awake. Monitor for signs of respiratory distress, such as increased respiratory rate, dyspnea, or decreased oxygen saturation.",
        "pathophysiology": "Post-operative pain and anesthesia reduce respiratory effort, leading to alveolar collapse (atelectasis). Accumulated secretions provide a medium for bacterial growth, increasing the risk of pneumonia. Incentive spirometry increases transpulmonary pressure, re-expanding alveoli and mobilizing secretions."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Strict bed rest is detrimental to recovery after TKA. Early mobilization is essential to prevent complications of immobility, such as VTE, pneumonia, pressure injuries, muscle atrophy, and constipation. Ambulation promotes circulation, strengthens muscles, and improves joint function.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "clinicalPearl": "Encourage the client to participate actively in physical therapy and follow the prescribed exercise regimen. Assist the client with getting out of bed as soon as safely possible, typically on post-operative day 0 or 1.",
        "pathophysiology": "Immobility leads to venous stasis, increasing the risk of DVT. Muscle disuse causes atrophy and weakness. Prolonged pressure on bony prominences leads to skin breakdown and pressure ulcer formation."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "Correct. Early ambulation with a walker promotes circulation, prevents complications of immobility, and facilitates a faster recovery. Weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT) is typically encouraged, allowing the client to gradually increase activity levels. Physical therapy guides the client in safe ambulation techniques and progressive exercises.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the client uses the walker correctly, maintaining proper posture and weight distribution. Monitor for signs of fatigue or pain during ambulation. Collaborate with physical therapy to adjust the ambulation plan as needed.",
        "pathophysiology": "Ambulation increases muscle activity, improving venous return and reducing the risk of DVT. Weight-bearing stimulates bone remodeling and strengthens muscles around the knee joint."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_6",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Applying a warm, moist compress to the incision site can increase edema, inflammation, and bleeding. Cold therapy (cryotherapy) is the preferred modality in the acute post-operative phase to reduce pain and swelling. Cold causes vasoconstriction, decreasing blood flow to the area and minimizing inflammation.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "clinicalPearl": "Apply ice packs to the knee for 20-30 minutes at a time, several times a day. Protect the skin with a thin cloth to prevent frostbite. Assess the skin regularly for signs of irritation or damage.",
        "pathophysiology": "Heat causes vasodilation, increasing blood flow and capillary permeability, leading to edema and inflammation. Cold causes vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow and inflammation."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_7",
        "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurovascular assessment of the affected extremity is crucial to monitor for complications such as compartment syndrome, nerve damage, or vascular compromise. Assessing pain, pallor, pulses, paresthesia, paralysis, and pressure (the 6 Ps) helps identify early signs of these complications, allowing for prompt intervention.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "clinicalPearl": "Compare the neurovascular status of the operative leg to the non-operative leg. Report any significant changes to the healthcare provider immediately. Be particularly vigilant for disproportionate pain, which may indicate compartment syndrome.",
        "pathophysiology": "Surgical trauma can cause swelling within the muscle compartments of the leg, leading to increased pressure and compression of nerves and blood vessels (compartment syndrome). Nerve damage can result from direct injury during surgery or compression from swelling. Vascular compromise can occur due to thrombosis or embolism."
