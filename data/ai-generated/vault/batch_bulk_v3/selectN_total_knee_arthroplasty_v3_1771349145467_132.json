                "id": "opt_1",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. Placing a pillow directly under the operative knee causes knee flexion, which increases the risk of developing a flexion contracture. It also creates pressure in the popliteal space, which can impede venous return and increase the risk of VTE.",
