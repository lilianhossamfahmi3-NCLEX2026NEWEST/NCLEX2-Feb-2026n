  "difficulty": 4,
  "stem": "A nurse in a neuromuscular clinic is assessing a 15-year-old client with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) during a routine follow-up appointment. The client is wheelchair-dependent. The parent states, 'For the past few weeks, he has been waking up with a bad headache almost every morning. He also seems extremely tired during the day, even though he's sleeping through the night.' The client's oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Which action should the nurse take first?",

        "optionId": "opt_01",
        "justification": "Incorrect. While cardiomyopathy is a common complication of DMD, the client's symptoms (morning headaches, daytime somnolence) suggest nocturnal hypoventilation. This is a higher priority. Cardiomyopathy in DMD results from progressive myocardial fibrosis, leading to decreased cardiac output and heart failure. While routine monitoring is crucial, addressing potential respiratory failure takes precedence.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Cardiomyopathy in DMD often presents with subtle signs initially. Regular echocardiograms are essential for early detection and management with medications like ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.",
        "sbar": "0900: Client with DMD reporting morning headaches and daytime sleepiness. O2 sat 96% on room air. Suspect nocturnal hypoventilation. Request order for pulmonary function tests and possible sleep study."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_02",
        "justification": "Correct. The client's symptoms strongly suggest nocturnal hypoventilation due to respiratory muscle weakness, a common and life-threatening complication of DMD. Morning headaches result from CO2 retention causing cerebral vasodilation. Daytime somnolence is due to disrupted sleep and chronic hypoxemia. Notifying the provider immediately allows for prompt evaluation (e.g., blood gas analysis, sleep study) and intervention (e.g., non-invasive ventilation). This prevents respiratory failure and potential long-term complications.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In DMD, respiratory muscle weakness often precedes noticeable changes in daytime oxygen saturation. Subtle symptoms like morning headaches and fatigue should prompt immediate investigation for nocturnal hypoventilation.",
        "sbar": "0900: Client with DMD reporting morning headaches and daytime sleepiness. O2 sat 96% on room air. Suspect nocturnal hypoventilation. Request order for pulmonary function tests and possible sleep study."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_03",
        "justification": "Incorrect. While dysphagia is a concern in DMD due to bulbar muscle weakness, the presenting symptoms are more indicative of respiratory compromise. Dysphagia can lead to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. However, the immediate threat is respiratory failure from hypoventilation. Addressing the respiratory issue first is crucial.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Dysphagia in DMD can be subtle. Observe for coughing or choking during meals, and consider a referral to speech therapy for a swallow evaluation. Modify food textures as needed to prevent aspiration.",
        "sbar": "0900: Client with DMD reporting morning headaches and daytime sleepiness. O2 sat 96% on room air. Suspect nocturnal hypoventilation. Request order for pulmonary function tests and possible sleep study."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_04",
        "justification": "Incorrect. Administering analgesics without addressing the underlying cause is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The headache is a symptom of hypercapnia secondary to hypoventilation. Masking the symptom without treating the respiratory issue could delay diagnosis and intervention, leading to respiratory failure.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Treating symptoms without identifying the underlying cause can be detrimental, especially in patients with chronic conditions like DMD. Always investigate the etiology of new or worsening symptoms.",
