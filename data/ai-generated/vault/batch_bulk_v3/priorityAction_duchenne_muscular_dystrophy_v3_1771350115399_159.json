    "stem": "A nurse in a neuromuscular clinic is assessing a 15-year-old client with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) during a routine follow-up appointment. The client is wheelchair-dependent. The parent states, 'For the past few weeks, he has been waking up with a bad headache almost every morning. He also seems extremely tired during the day, even though he's sleeping through the night.' The client's oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Which action should the nurse take first?",

                "optionId": "opt_01",
                "justification": "Incorrect. While cardiomyopathy is a common and serious complication of DMD that requires routine monitoring, the client's presenting symptoms—morning headaches and daytime somnolence—are classic signs of respiratory muscle weakness leading to nocturnal hypoventilation and carbon dioxide retention. This respiratory issue is a more immediate threat and directly correlates with the reported cues, making it the priority."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_02",
                "justification": "Correct. The combination of morning headaches and daytime somnolence in a client with advanced DMD is a hallmark sign of nocturnal hypoventilation and hypercapnia. This indicates significant respiratory muscle fatigue and impending respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening emergency. The nurse's first action is to recognize these critical cues and immediately escalate care by notifying the healthcare provider for further evaluation, such as ordering pulmonary function tests or a sleep study, and potential initiation of non-invasive ventilation."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_03",
                "justification": "Incorrect. Dysphagia and aspiration risk are significant concerns in DMD. However, the specific cluster of symptoms (morning headache, daytime sleepiness) does not directly point to a swallowing issue. While a swallow evaluation is an important part of comprehensive care, it does not address the urgent physiological problem of inadequate gas exchange during sleep, which is the most likely cause of the client's new symptoms."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "justification": "Incorrect. This action is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. Treating the symptom (headache) without investigating its underlying cause would mask a critical indicator of respiratory decline. The headache is a result of cerebral vasodilation from elevated CO2 levels overnight. Providing analgesics fails to address the life-threatening root cause and provides a false sense of security."
