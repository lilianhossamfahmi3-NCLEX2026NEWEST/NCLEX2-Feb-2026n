    "stem": "A 28-year-old client is newly admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. During the initial assessment, the nurse observes the client pacing, muttering, and frequently glancing at an electrical outlet in the room. The client states, \"The voices are telling me I need to do something bad to stop the signals.\" Which action should the nurse take first?",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The nurse's priority action is to ensure client safety. The client is experiencing command hallucinations (voices telling them to do something) and is focused on a potential source of harm (the electrical outlet). The most appropriate initial action is to verbally intervene in a therapeutic manner that prioritizes safety, removes the client from the hazardous situation, and offers the nurse's presence for support and de-escalation. This approach directly addresses the safety risk while maintaining a therapeutic alliance.",
        "incorrect": "While medication may be necessary and further assessment is important, neither is the first priority over ensuring immediate environmental safety. Directly confronting or dismissing the client's experience of hallucinations is non-therapeutic and can increase agitation and mistrust. The primary responsibility of the nurse in this situation is to protect the client from harm.",

                "content": "Administering PRN medication is not the first action. The nurse must first use the least restrictive intervention. Attempting verbal de-escalation and ensuring environmental safety should precede chemical restraint. Additionally, medication takes time to become effective, leaving the client at immediate risk.",

                "content": "This response is non-therapeutic because it dismisses the client's reality. Arguing with or denying a client's hallucination can increase anxiety, lead to mistrust of the staff, and escalate agitation, which compromises safety.",

                "label": "C",
                "content": "This is the correct action because it prioritizes immediate safety. The nurse expresses concern (validating the client's distress without validating the hallucination), proposes removing the client from the potential danger (the outlet), and offers personal presence, which is a key de-escalation and safety strategy.",

The immediate risk to safety must be addressed first by removing the client from the hazardous environment. This assessment can be done once the client is in a safer location.",
