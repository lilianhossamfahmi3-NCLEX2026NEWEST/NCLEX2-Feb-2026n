  "stem": "A 28-year-old client is newly admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. During the initial assessment at 1400, the nurse observes the client pacing, muttering, and frequently glancing at an electrical outlet in the room. The client states, \"The voices are telling me I need to do something bad to stop the signals.\" Which action should the nurse take first?",

  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The nurse's priority is client safety. The client is experiencing command hallucinations, indicating a high risk for self-harm. The statement \"The voices are telling me I need to do something bad to stop the signals\" suggests an imminent threat. Moving the client to the dayroom provides a safer environment and allows for closer observation and intervention. This action addresses the immediate safety concern while establishing a therapeutic presence. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder affecting a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly. Command hallucinations are auditory hallucinations that instruct the individual to perform specific actions, which can be dangerous. These hallucinations arise from imbalances in neurotransmitter activity, particularly dopamine, in the brain's auditory processing and cognitive control centers. The dysregulation leads to misinterpretation of internal thoughts as external voices, compelling the individual to act on these commands.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize safety when a client reports command hallucinations. Acknowledge the client's distress without validating the hallucination. Least restrictive interventions should be attempted first.",
    "incorrect": "Administering PRN medication or further assessing the hallucinations are not the priority actions. The client's statement indicates an immediate risk of harm, requiring immediate intervention to ensure safety. Dismissing the client's experience is non-therapeutic and can escalate agitation.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Directly confronting or dismissing hallucinations can increase the client's anxiety and paranoia. This is because the client perceives the hallucinations as real, and denying their reality can be invalidating and lead to mistrust. Increased anxiety can exacerbate psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of acting on command hallucinations.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Avoid arguing with or denying a client's hallucinations. Instead, focus on the client's feelings and offer reassurance and support.",

        "label": "C",
        "content": "This is the correct action because it prioritizes immediate safety. The nurse expresses concern (validating the client's distress without validating the hallucination), proposes removing the client from the potential danger (the outlet), and offers personal presence, which is a key de-escalation and safety strategy.",

The immediate risk to safety must be addressed first by removing the client from the hazardous environment. This assessment can be done once the client is in a safer location.",
