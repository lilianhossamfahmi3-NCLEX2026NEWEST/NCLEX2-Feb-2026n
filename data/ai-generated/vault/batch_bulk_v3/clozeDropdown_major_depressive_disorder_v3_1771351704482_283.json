        "correct": "The correct plan of care prioritizes client safety, utilizes appropriate therapeutic communication techniques, and provides accurate medication education. For a client with severe MDD and suicidal ideation, safety is the absolute priority. Implementing one-to-one observation directly addresses the high risk of self-harm, especially in the early stages of antidepressant therapy when energy may return before mood improves. To build rapport with a withdrawn client, sitting with them in silence for brief, frequent periods conveys presence and acceptance without demanding verbal interaction, which can feel overwhelming. Finally, educating the client that sertraline, an SSRI, can take 4-6 weeks for full effect is crucial for managing expectations and promoting long-term adherence to the treatment plan.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect combinations fail to prioritize safety, employ non-therapeutic communication, or provide inaccurate medication information. Placing the client in a private room increases isolation and suicide risk. Encouraging group therapy is premature and can be overwhelming for a severely depressed and withdrawn client. Using cheerful language, offering platitudes, or asking 'why' questions are non-therapeutic and can invalidate the client's feelings. Providing misinformation about the medication's onset of action, addictive potential, or duration of use can lead to non-adherence, treatment failure, and potential relapse.",
