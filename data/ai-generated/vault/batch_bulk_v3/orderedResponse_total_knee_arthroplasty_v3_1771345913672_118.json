        "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety and comfort to ensure successful initial ambulation after a TKA. The sequence begins with assessing and managing pain, as uncontrolled pain is a major barrier to mobility. Next, safety equipment (gait belt) is applied. The client is then moved to a dangling position to assess for orthostatic hypotension before standing. The assistive device (walker) is positioned for immediate access upon standing. Only after these preparatory steps are complete does the nurse provide instructions for the actual ambulation, using the correct gait pattern. The final step is always evaluation and documentation of the client's response to the intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence could compromise client safety or the effectiveness of the intervention. For example, attempting to ambulate a client with unmanaged pain can lead to guarding, refusal to participate, and an increased risk of falls. Failing to apply a gait belt or assess for orthostatic hypotension before standing creates a significant fall risk. Positioning the walker after the client is already standing leaves them unsupported. Instructing on ambulation before the client is properly prepared can cause confusion and anxiety.",
