    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety and comfort to ensure successful initial ambulation after a TKA. The sequence begins with assessing and managing pain, as uncontrolled pain is a major barrier to mobility. Next, safety equipment (gait belt) is applied. The client is then moved to a dangling position to assess for orthostatic hypotension before standing. The assistive device (walker) is positioned for immediate access upon standing. Only after these preparatory steps are complete does the nurse provide instructions for the actual ambulation, using the correct gait pattern. The final step is always evaluation and documentation of the client's response to the intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Any other sequence could compromise client safety or the effectiveness of the intervention. For example, attempting to ambulate a client with unmanaged pain can lead to guarding, refusal to participate, and an increased risk of falls. Failing to apply a gait belt or assess for orthostatic hypotension before standing creates a significant fall risk. Positioning the walker after the client is already standing leaves them unsupported. Instructing on ambulation before the client is properly prepared can cause confusion and anxiety.",

Administering an analgesic 30-60 minutes before the activity ensures the medication reaches its peak effect, maximizing comfort and cooperation. Postoperative pain following a TKA is primarily nociceptive, resulting from tissue damage and inflammation. Nociceptors are activated, sending pain signals via A-delta and C fibers to the spinal cord and then to the brain, where pain is perceived. Effective pain management interrupts this pathway, reducing the intensity of the pain signal.",

Moving the client to a sitting position on the edge of the bed allows the nurse to assess for orthostatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness) before the client attempts to bear weight, which minimizes the risk of a syncopal event. Orthostatic hypotension occurs due to decreased venous return and reduced cardiac output upon standing. This is often exacerbated postoperatively due to factors such as fluid shifts, medication effects, and prolonged bed rest. Dangling allows the body to adjust to the change in position gradually, minimizing the risk of a sudden drop in blood pressure.",

This gait pattern ensures that the operative leg is only bearing weight when the client has a stable base of support provided by the walker and the non-operative leg.
