    "question": "A 68-year-old male client returns to the cardiac step-down unit after a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement via the right femoral artery for an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The client is alert, reports no chest pain, and has stable vital signs. The nurse is developing the plan of care for the immediate post-procedure period. Which intervention is the priority for the nurse to include?",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "correctAnswerRationale": "The priority intervention in the immediate post-PCI period via femoral access is to prevent complications at the arterial puncture site, specifically bleeding, hematoma, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Maintaining the affected leg in a straight, extended position and enforcing strict bed rest minimizes movement and pressure changes at the femoral artery site. This directly prevents flexion of the hip, which could dislodge the clot or closure device, leading to life-threatening hemorrhage. Given the client is on antiplatelet therapy, this risk is significantly elevated.",

            {
                "option": "Administer a prescribed stool softener with the next meal.",
                "rationale": "This is an appropriate intervention to prevent the Valsalva maneuver, which can increase myocardial oxygen demand and stress the cardiovascular system. However, it is not the most immediate priority. The risk of acute, catastrophic bleeding from the arterial access site is a more immediate life-threatening concern than the risk of constipation or straining during a bowel movement."

                "option": "Encourage the client to use the incentive spirometer every hour while awake.",
                "rationale": "Pulmonary hygiene is important to prevent atelectasis, especially for a client on bed rest. While a valid component of the overall care plan, it is not the priority over preventing a major vascular complication. Hemodynamic stability and access site integrity are the primary focus immediately following a PCI."
            },
            {
                "option": "Initiate cardiac rehabilitation education regarding a low-sodium, low-fat diet.",
                "rationale": "Patient education on lifestyle modifications is crucial for long-term secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, this is not a priority in the immediate post-procedural phase. The focus must first be on physiological stability and preventing acute complications. Education can be initiated once the client is stable and beyond the initial high-risk period for bleeding."
