  "question": "A 68-year-old male client returns to the cardiac step-down unit at 1400 after a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement via the right femoral artery for an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The client is alert, reports no chest pain, and has stable vital signs. The nurse is developing the plan of care for the immediate post-procedure period. Which intervention is the priority for the nurse to include?",

      "text": "Encourage the client to use the incentive spirometer every hour while awake.",

    }
  ],
  "answerBreakdown": {
    "correctAnswerRationale": "Maintaining the right leg in a straight, extended position is the priority. PCI via femoral access carries a significant risk of bleeding, hematoma formation, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage at the puncture site. The femoral artery is a large vessel, and disruption can lead to rapid blood loss. Keeping the leg straight minimizes hip flexion, which can disrupt the clot or closure device at the arterial puncture site, especially with antiplatelet medications. This position promotes hemostasis and reduces the risk of life-threatening complications. Post-PCI, the body initiates the coagulation cascade to seal the arterial puncture. Movement, especially hip flexion, can shear these newly formed clots, leading to bleeding. Antiplatelet medications like aspirin and ticagrelor further inhibit platelet aggregation, increasing bleeding risk.",
    "distractorRationales": [
      {
        "option": "Administer a prescribed stool softener with the next meal.",
        "rationale": "Administering a stool softener is appropriate to prevent straining during bowel movements (Valsalva maneuver), which can increase intrathoracic pressure and potentially affect cardiac output and increase myocardial oxygen demand. However, the immediate risk of bleeding from the femoral artery access site is a higher priority. Straining can also increase blood pressure, potentially dislodging the clot at the femoral artery puncture site. While important, it's secondary to preventing immediate vascular complications."
      },
      {
        "option": "Encourage the client to use the incentive spirometer every hour while awake.",
        "rationale": "Incentive spirometry is beneficial to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, especially post-procedure and with bed rest. However, the immediate priority is preventing vascular complications from the femoral artery access site. Atelectasis reduces gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia and increased work of breathing. While important for overall recovery, it's not as immediately life-threatening as a potential hemorrhage."
      },
      {
        "option": "Initiate cardiac rehabilitation education regarding a low-sodium, low-fat diet.",
        "rationale": "Cardiac rehabilitation education is crucial for long-term secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. A low-sodium, low-fat diet helps manage blood pressure and cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of future cardiac events. However, this is not the priority in the immediate post-procedural phase. The focus is on physiological stability and preventing acute complications. Education can be initiated once the client is stable and beyond the initial high-risk period for bleeding. Dietary changes impact long-term cardiovascular health, not immediate post-PCI complications."
