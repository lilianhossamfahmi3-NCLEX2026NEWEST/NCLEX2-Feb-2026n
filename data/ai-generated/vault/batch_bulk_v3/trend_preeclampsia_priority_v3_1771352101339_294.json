    "correct": "The severe headache unrelieved by acetaminophen, +4 DTRs with clonus, and a platelet count of 95,000/mm³ at 1800 are critical findings requiring immediate follow-up. \n\n*   **Severe Headache:** In preeclampsia, cerebral vasospasm and edema lead to increased intracranial pressure, causing a severe headache. Acetaminophen is often ineffective due to the underlying pathophysiology. This indicates a high risk of seizure activity.\n*   **+4 DTRs with Clonus:** Hyperreflexia, especially with clonus, indicates central nervous system (CNS) irritability. Preeclampsia causes increased neuronal excitability, leading to exaggerated reflexes. Clonus signifies a heightened state of CNS stimulation and an increased risk of eclampsia (seizure).\n*   **Platelet Count 95,000/mm³:** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a hallmark of HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), a severe complication of preeclampsia. The pathophysiology involves endothelial damage and platelet activation, leading to platelet consumption and decreased platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n\nThese findings indicate a rapid progression towards eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, necessitating immediate interventions such as magnesium sulfate administration (to prevent seizures), antihypertensive medications (to control blood pressure), and potentially emergent delivery to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.",
    "incorrect": "Elevated blood pressure, decreased urine output, and increased proteinuria, while significant in preeclampsia, are not as immediately life-threatening as the signs of impending seizure (severe headache, clonus) or HELLP syndrome (thrombocytopenia). Addressing the neurological and hematological compromise takes priority.\n\n*   **Elevated Blood Pressure:** While a BP of 172/114 mmHg is severely elevated, it is an expected finding in preeclampsia with severe features. The priority is to address the acute complications arising from this hypertension.\n*   **Decreased Urine Output:** Oliguria (low urine output) indicates decreased renal perfusion secondary to vasoconstriction in preeclampsia. While concerning, it is not as immediately life-threatening as the neurological and hematological complications.\n*   **Increased Proteinuria:** Increased proteinuria reflects worsening glomerular damage due to preeclampsia. While it confirms the severity of the disease, it does not signal an acute, life-threatening event in the same way that severe neurological symptoms or critical lab value changes do.",
