These conditions necessitate immediate intervention, including seizure precautions, potential administration of magnesium sulfate, and preparation for emergent delivery to prevent severe maternal and fetal morbidity or mortality.",

However, they are not as acutely life-threatening as the signs of impending seizure (severe headache, clonus) or the development of a separate life-threatening syndrome like HELLP (thrombocytopenia). The priority is to address the cues that signal the most immediate danger to the client's central nervous and hematologic systems.",
