    "question": "The nurse is reviewing the electronic health record for a client who is 2 days post-operative following a right upper lobectomy. Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that require immediate follow-up.",
    "prompt": "The client is alert but restless. Reports incisional pain as 8/10. Last dose of morphine was 4 hours ago. Vital signs: T 38.1°C, HR 112, RR 24, BP 108/60, SpO2 91% on 2L NC. Diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe with accessory muscle use. States it \"hurts too much to take a deep breath.\" Chest tube to -20 cm H2O suction has 25 mL serosanguineous drainage in the past hour with tidaling in the water seal chamber. A new, fine crackling sensation is palpated on the skin of the upper chest and neck. Incision dressing is clean and dry.",

        {
            "option": "The client is alert but restless.",
            "rationale": "Correct. Restlessness is an early and significant sign of hypoxia. This change in mental status, combined with abnormal vital signs, indicates compromised oxygenation that requires immediate assessment and intervention.",

        {
            "option": "Reports incisional pain as 8/10.",
            "rationale": "Correct. Severe, uncontrolled pain (8/10) is a critical finding. It directly inhibits the client's ability to perform deep breathing and coughing exercises, leading to shallow respirations and increasing the risk of significant complications like atelectasis and pneumonia.",
            "isCorrect": true

        {
            "option": "Last dose of morphine was 4 hours ago.",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. This statement provides context for the client's pain level but is not, by itself, a clinical finding requiring immediate action. The critical cue is the pain score of 8/10, not the time of the last medication dose.",
            "isCorrect": false

        {
            "option": "Vital signs: T 38.1°C,",
            "rationale": "Correct. A fever on post-operative day 2, particularly with concurrent respiratory findings, is a classic sign of atelectasis. This finding is a key cue indicating a developing pulmonary complication.",

            "option": "HR 112,",
            "rationale": "Correct. Tachycardia (heart rate > 100/min) is a compensatory response to physiological stressors such as hypoxia, pain, and fever. It is a sensitive indicator that the client's condition is deteriorating.",

            "option": "RR 24,",
