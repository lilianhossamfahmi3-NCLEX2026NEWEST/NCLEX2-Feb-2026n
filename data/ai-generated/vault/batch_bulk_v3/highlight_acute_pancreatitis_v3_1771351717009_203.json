He rates the pain as a 9/10 and states it radiates to his mid-back. Reports nausea and has vomited twice. History of cholelithiasis.\n\nObjective:\nVital Signs: T 38.1°C (100.6°F), Heart rate 122/min, Respiratory rate 24/min, Blood pressure 94/58 mmHg, SpO2 94% on room air.\nAssessment: Client is restless and appears acutely ill. Abdomen is distended, tender to palpation with guarding in the epigastric area. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. A faint bruising is noted on the left flank. Fine crackles auscultated in the left lung base. Skin is warm and diaphoretic.\n\nInitial Laboratory Results:\nWBC: 17,500/mm³\nSerum Lipase: 1,200 U/L\nSerum Amylase: 850 U/L\nSerum Glucose: 210 mg/dL\nSerum Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL",

Hypotension is a critical finding that indicates significant intravascular fluid loss due to third-spacing of fluids, vasodilation from the systemic inflammatory response, or potential hemorrhage.
