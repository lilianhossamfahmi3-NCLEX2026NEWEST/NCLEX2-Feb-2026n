  "question": "A registered nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is assigned to a newborn delivered one hour ago. The infant was diagnosed prenatally with myelomeningocele. The nurse's assessment reveals a 5 cm sac-like lesion covered by a thin membrane on the lumbosacral area. The infant is placed in a radiant warmer. Based on the unique scenario seed BATCH-300-193-1771351326109, which immediate nursing action is the priority to prevent injury to the exposed sac?",

The myelomeningocele sac is prone to drying, which can lead to cracking and rupture, increasing the risk of infection (meningitis) and further neurological damage. Covering the sac with a sterile, non-adherent dressing soaked in warm, sterile normal saline maintains moisture, prevents the dressing from adhering to the delicate tissue, and provides a sterile barrier against contaminants. Using warm saline is crucial to prevent hypothermia in the newborn."

        "rationale": "While positioning is critical, the prone (on the abdomen) position is the gold standard for infants with an unprotected myelomeningocele. This position minimizes pressure on the sac and reduces the risk of trauma or rupture. A side-lying position may still allow for pressure on the sac and is not the optimal choice for protecting the lesion."

        "option": "C",
        "rationale": "Diapering is contraindicated until after surgical repair of the myelomeningocele. A diaper, especially a tight one, can rub against the sac, causing irritation and increasing the risk of rupture. Furthermore, it can introduce stool and urine, which are major sources of contamination, directly to the fragile lesion, significantly increasing the risk of a central nervous system infection."

However, it is not the most immediate priority. The primary, immediate goal is to protect the exposed spinal cord and meninges from infection and injury. While this assessment should be initiated, protecting the sac takes precedence."

ClinicalPearl: Prompt protection of the myelomeningocele sac is crucial to minimize the risk of infection and neurological complications. Pathophysiology: Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through an opening in the vertebrae. This exposure increases the risk of infection and injury to the delicate neural tissue."
