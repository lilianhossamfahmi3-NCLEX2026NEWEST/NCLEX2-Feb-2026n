    "correct": "The infant's clinical presentation demonstrates a trend of developing hydrocephalus, a common complication post-myelomeningocele repair. Hydrocephalus results from an obstruction or malformation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, leading to CSF accumulation in the ventricles and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The data shows a rapid increase in head circumference, a change in fontanel status (soft/flat to bulging/tense), increasing irritability progressing to lethargy, and a high-pitched cry. Bradycardia is a late sign of increased ICP in infants. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent neurological damage.",
    "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect interpretations of the trend data. Expected recovery involves stable vital signs, a soft fontanel, and improving consolability. Surgical site infection would present with localized signs like erythema, warmth, or purulent drainage, and likely a more significant fever. Dehydration would be characterized by a sunken fontanel, tachycardia, and poor skin turgor.",
