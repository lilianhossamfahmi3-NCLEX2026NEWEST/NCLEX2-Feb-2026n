The obstruction or malformation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways leads to its accumulation in the ventricles, causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The trend data shows a rapid increase in head circumference, a change from a soft/flat fontanel to a bulging/tense one, increasing irritability followed by lethargy, and a high-pitched cry. The subtle drop in heart rate (bradycardia) is also an ominous sign of rising ICP in an infant.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect interpretations of the trend data. An expected recovery would involve stable vital signs, a soft fontanel, and improving consolability. A surgical site infection would present with localized signs like erythema, warmth, or purulent drainage, and likely a more significant fever, none of which are present. Dehydration would be characterized by a sunken fontanel, tachycardia, and poor skin turgor, which are opposite to the findings presented.",
