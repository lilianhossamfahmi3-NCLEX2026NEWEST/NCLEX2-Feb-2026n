The client reports a persistent headache for the past 12 hours unrelieved by acetaminophen, stating 'I'm seeing spots,' and new-onset 'heartburn-like' pain in the upper abdomen. She denies vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid and states fetal movement has been normal. Bilateral lower extremity edema +3 pitting is noted. The client is placed on continuous fetal monitoring. Based on the provided client information, complete the bowtie by selecting the most likely condition, two priority actions the nurse should take, and two parameters the nurse should monitor.",

    "correct": "The client's presentation of hypertension (168/114 mmHg), proteinuria (3+), and end-organ damage symptoms (persistent headache, visual disturbances - 'seeing spots', and epigastric pain) are classic signs of preeclampsia with severe features. The pathophysiology involves widespread endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm, leading to decreased organ perfusion and increased vascular permeability. This results in hypertension, proteinuria (due to glomerular damage), and symptoms like headache and visual changes (cerebral edema and ischemia). Epigastric pain can indicate liver involvement (HELLP syndrome) or stretching of the liver capsule. The immediate priorities are to prevent eclamptic seizures and to control the severe hypertension to prevent a stroke. Therefore, initiating an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate (the gold standard for seizure prophylaxis) and administering an IV antihypertensive agent (like labetalol or hydralazine) are the two most critical actions. Magnesium sulfate works by depressing the central nervous system, raising the seizure threshold. Antihypertensives reduce the risk of stroke and placental abruption by lowering blood pressure. Following these interventions, the nurse must closely monitor for signs of drug efficacy and toxicity. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) and clonus are monitored to assess CNS irritability and magnesium toxicity (diminished or absent reflexes). Urine output is a critical indicator of renal perfusion and is also a key parameter for monitoring magnesium toxicity, as the drug is cleared by the kidneys and oliguria increases the risk of toxicity.",
    "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not address the immediate life-threatening risks. Gestational hypertension lacks proteinuria and severe features. Eclampsia involves active seizures. HELLP syndrome is a specific laboratory diagnosis that may be developing but the overarching clinical diagnosis is preeclampsia with severe features. A placental abruption would typically present with vaginal bleeding and uterine tenderness. Preparing for amniotomy or encouraging specific positions are secondary to maternal stabilization. While an indwelling catheter is necessary, it is not as immediately life-saving as controlling BP and preventing seizures. Monitoring FHR, contractions, or glucose levels are important but do not directly assess the maternal response to the critical interventions for severe preeclampsia.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This action is correct. A blood pressure of 168/114 mmHg constitutes a hypertensive crisis in pregnancy, placing the client at high risk for cerebrovascular events (stroke) and placental abruption. Prompt administration of an IV antihypertensive, such as labetalol or hydralazine, is a priority to safely lower the blood pressure. The goal is to gradually reduce the BP to a safe range (e.g., systolic 140-150 mmHg, diastolic 90-100 mmHg) to prevent abrupt drops in placental perfusion."

        "explanation": "This action is correct. The client's headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain indicate significant central nervous system (CNS) irritability, placing her at high risk for an eclamptic seizure. Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for seizure prophylaxis in clients with severe preeclampsia. Magnesium sulfate acts as a CNS depressant, increasing the seizure threshold. A loading dose is typically administered, followed by a maintenance infusion."

        "explanation": "This action is incorrect. While delivery is the ultimate cure for preeclampsia, maternal stabilization must occur first. Inducing labor via amniotomy before controlling the client's severe hypertension and providing seizure prophylaxis would be unsafe and could precipitate a seizure or stroke. Delivery should be considered after maternal stabilization."

While an indwelling catheter will be necessary for strict intake and output monitoring (especially with magnesium sulfate), it is not one of the top two priorities.
