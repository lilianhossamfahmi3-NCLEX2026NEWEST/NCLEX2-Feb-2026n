The immediate priorities are to prevent eclamptic seizures and to control the severe hypertension to prevent a stroke. Therefore, initiating an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate (the gold standard for seizure prophylaxis) and administering an IV antihypertensive agent (like labetalol or hydralazine) are the two most critical actions. Following these interventions, the nurse must closely monitor for signs of drug efficacy and toxicity. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) and clonus are monitored to assess CNS irritability and magnesium toxicity (diminished or absent reflexes). Urine output is a critical indicator of renal perfusion and is also a key parameter for monitoring magnesium toxicity, as the drug is cleared by the kidneys and oliguria increases the risk of toxicity.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not address the immediate life-threatening risks. Gestational hypertension lacks proteinuria and severe features. Eclampsia involves active seizures. HELLP syndrome is a specific laboratory diagnosis that may be developing but the overarching clinical diagnosis is preeclampsia with severe features. A placental abruption would typically present with vaginal bleeding and uterine tenderness. Preparing for amniotomy or encouraging specific positions are secondary to maternal stabilization. While an indwelling catheter is necessary, it is not as immediately life-saving as controlling BP and preventing seizures. Monitoring FHR, contractions, or glucose levels are important but do not directly assess the maternal response to the critical interventions for severe preeclampsia.",
