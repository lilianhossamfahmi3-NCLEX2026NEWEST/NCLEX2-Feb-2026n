    "correct": "The priority dietary modification for a CF client with a low BMI (17.5) and steatorrhea, despite enzyme use, is a high-protein, high-calorie diet with unrestricted fat intake. CF causes pancreatic insufficiency, impairing fat, protein, and carbohydrate absorption. The resulting malabsorption, coupled with increased metabolic demands, necessitates a diet providing 150-200% of the recommended daily allowance. Unrestricted fat intake is crucial because fat is calorie-dense and essential for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Steatorrhea indicates the current enzyme dosage is insufficient for the client's fat intake, requiring adjustment in collaboration with the provider. Restricting fat would exacerbate malnutrition and hinder growth. **Clinical Pearl:** *Monitor stool output and consistency to evaluate the effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Adjust dosage based on dietary fat intake and individual response.*",
    "incorrect": "Restricting fat, carbohydrates, or fluids is generally contraindicated in CF nutritional management. A low-fat diet limits caloric intake and impairs absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. A gluten-free diet is indicated for celiac disease, not CF. Fluid restriction can lead to dehydration and thickened mucus, exacerbating respiratory complications. While MCTs can be helpful, they are not the primary dietary intervention. The focus should be on maximizing overall caloric and nutrient intake.",

The underlying issue in CF is fat malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency, which is managed with enzyme replacement and a high-fat diet, not fat restriction.
