        "correct": "Clients with cystic fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. This, combined with an increased metabolic rate, necessitates a diet that is high in calories, protein, and fat—often 150-200% of the recommended daily allowance. The goal is to maximize nutrient intake to support growth, weight gain, and immune function. The presence of steatorrhea, despite enzyme use, indicates that the enzyme dosage likely needs to be adjusted in collaboration with the provider, not that fat intake should be restricted. Restricting fat, the most calorie-dense nutrient, would be counterproductive to achieving the necessary weight gain (evidenced by the low BMI of 17.5).",
        "incorrect": "Dietary restrictions such as low-fat, gluten-free, or fluid restriction are generally contraindicated or not indicated for cystic fibrosis nutritional management. A low-fat diet would severely limit caloric intake and prevent the absorption of essential fat-soluble vitamins. A gluten-free diet is only necessary for celiac disease, which is a separate condition. Fluid restriction is dangerous as CF clients are prone to dehydration and need adequate fluids to help thin their tenacious mucus secretions.",
