        "correct": "The highest priority for a newborn with a myelomeningocele is to protect the exposed sac from injury and contamination to prevent central nervous system infection (meningitis). This is achieved first by positioning the infant prone to eliminate pressure on the sac (Step 1). Next, the sac must be kept moist and sterile to prevent drying, cracking, and entry of microorganisms (Step 2). After securing the sac, the nurse addresses thermoregulation, a critical physiological need for all newborns, by placing the infant under a warmer (Step 3). Administering prophylactic antibiotics is the next priority to systemically combat potential infection (Step 4). Finally, obtaining a baseline head circumference is important for monitoring for hydrocephalus, a common complication, but it is a surveillance measure and not an immediate life-preserving intervention (Step 5).",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these actions places the infant at risk. For example, measuring head circumference or administering medications before positioning the infant and covering the sac leaves the delicate neural tissue unprotected and vulnerable to rupture or infection. While thermoregulation and antibiotic administration are vital, they are secondary to the immediate physical protection of the exposed spinal cord.",
