    "correct": "The highest priority for a newborn with a myelomeningocele is to protect the exposed sac from injury and contamination to prevent central nervous system infection (meningitis). Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through an opening in the vertebrae. This leaves the spinal cord vulnerable to trauma and infection. Positioning the infant prone minimizes pressure on the sac, reducing the risk of rupture and CSF leakage (Step 1). A sterile, saline-soaked dressing maintains a moist environment, preventing desiccation and cracking of the sac, which could create a portal of entry for pathogens (Step 2). Newborns are prone to hypothermia due to their large surface area to volume ratio and limited ability to thermoregulate. Placing the infant under a radiant warmer prevents cold stress, which can lead to increased oxygen consumption and metabolic acidosis (Step 3). Prophylactic antibiotics are crucial to prevent ascending infection and meningitis, a severe complication of myelomeningocele (Step 4). Monitoring head circumference is essential to detect hydrocephalus, a common comorbidity due to Chiari II malformation often associated with myelomeningocele, but it is not the immediate priority (Step 5).",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these actions places the infant at risk for infection, injury, and hypothermia. Delaying prone positioning and sac protection increases the risk of trauma and infection. Prioritizing head circumference measurement or antibiotic administration before addressing the sac's integrity and thermoregulation compromises the infant's immediate safety and well-being. Failing to address thermoregulation can lead to cold stress and metabolic instability.",

      {
        "label": "Place the infant in a prone position with hips slightly flexed.",
        "content": "This is the FIRST and HIGHEST priority. Placing the infant prone with slight hip flexion immediately relieves pressure on the myelomeningocele sac. This prevents trauma to the delicate neural tissue and reduces the risk of rupture, which could lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and a direct pathway for central nervous system (CNS) infection (meningitis). The prone position also facilitates drainage of secretions.",

        "content": "This is the SECOND priority. After positioning, the sac must be protected from drying and contamination. A dry sac is prone to cracking and rupture, increasing the risk of infection. A sterile, moist dressing maintains the sac's integrity and provides a crucial barrier against environmental pathogens, preventing localized infection and meningitis. Non-adherent dressings prevent further trauma when changing the dressing.",

        "content": "This is the FOURTH priority. Due to the high risk of meningitis, prophylactic antibiotics are essential. The exposed neural tissue provides a direct pathway for pathogens to enter the CNS. Antibiotics help prevent ascending infection and systemic spread. However, establishing physical barriers to infection (positioning and dressing) is the immediate priority before initiating systemic treatment.",

Establishing a baseline head circumference is a crucial part of ongoing assessment to monitor for increasing intracranial pressure. However, this is a surveillance measure, not an immediate life-saving intervention, and can be performed after the infant is stabilized and the sac is protected.",
