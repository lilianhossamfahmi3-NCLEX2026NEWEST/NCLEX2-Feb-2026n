Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides effective and timely management of severe acute pain. Subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is the standard of care for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery. Encouraging active ankle pumps is a crucial non-pharmacological intervention that promotes venous return and reduces the risk of VTE without compromising the surgical site. Finally, frequent neurovascular assessment, including monitoring pedal pulse strength and sensation in the affected leg, is essential to detect early signs of complications such as compartment syndrome or arterial occlusion.",
        "incorrect": "Other combinations are less appropriate or potentially harmful. As-needed oral analgesics are often insufficient for severe immediate post-operative pain. Using a CPM machine is not a primary pain intervention. Ice is an adjunct therapy, not a primary one. Relying on low-dose aspirin or SCDs alone for VTE prophylaxis is inadequate for this high-risk procedure. Placing a pillow under the knee increases the risk of a flexion contracture, and strict bed rest heightens VTE risk. Assessments like Homan's sign (unreliable), fingernail capillary refill (irrelevant to the lower extremity), and Babinski reflex (assesses upper motor neuron lesions) are not the priority neurovascular checks for a TKA.",
