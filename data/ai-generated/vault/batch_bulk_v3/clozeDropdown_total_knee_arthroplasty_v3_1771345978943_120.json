    "correct": "The optimal plan of care for a client in the immediate post-operative period following a total knee arthroplasty involves a multi-faceted approach. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides effective and timely management of severe acute pain. PCA allows the client to self-administer small, frequent doses of an opioid, maintaining a consistent analgesic level. Subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is the standard of care for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery. Enoxaparin inhibits clotting factors, preventing thrombus formation. Encouraging active ankle pumps is a crucial non-pharmacological intervention that promotes venous return and reduces the risk of VTE without compromising the surgical site. Ankle pumps activate the calf muscle pump, increasing blood flow. Finally, frequent neurovascular assessment, including monitoring pedal pulse strength and sensation in the affected leg, is essential to detect early signs of complications such as compartment syndrome or arterial occlusion. These assessments identify compromised blood flow or nerve damage.",
    "incorrect": "Other combinations are less appropriate or potentially harmful. As-needed oral analgesics are often insufficient for severe immediate post-operative pain. Using a CPM machine is not a primary pain intervention. Ice is an adjunct therapy, not a primary one. Relying on low-dose aspirin or SCDs alone for VTE prophylaxis is inadequate for this high-risk procedure. Placing a pillow under the knee increases the risk of a flexion contracture, and strict bed rest heightens VTE risk. Assessments like Homan's sign (unreliable), fingernail capillary refill (irrelevant to the lower extremity), and Babinski reflex (assesses upper motor neuron lesions) are not the priority neurovascular checks for a TKA.",

        "content": "Incorrect. While oral opioids are used post-operatively, PRN administration is often inadequate for the severe, acute pain following a TKA. PCA or continuous methods provide better analgesia. The pathophysiology of post-operative pain involves tissue damage and inflammation, leading to nociceptor activation and pain signal transmission to the brain. PRN dosing may not maintain consistent therapeutic levels to effectively block these pain signals.",

        "content": "Incorrect. A CPM machine mobilizes the knee joint to improve range of motion and prevent stiffness, but it's not a primary pain management intervention. While CPM can indirectly reduce pain by preventing stiffness and promoting circulation, it does not directly address the acute pain mechanisms in the immediate post-operative period.",

PCA allows self-administration of small, frequent opioid doses, providing excellent pain control and maintaining consistent analgesic levels for severe acute post-operative pain. Hydromorphone binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, blocking pain signals.

Aspirin has antiplatelet properties and is sometimes used for VTE prophylaxis in lower-risk scenarios, but enoxaparin is the standard of care after high-risk orthopedic surgery like a TKA.

Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) that is highly effective and commonly prescribed for VTE prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery due to its predictable anticoagulant response and ease of administration.

It requires frequent laboratory monitoring (aPTT) and carries a higher bleeding risk compared to LMWH for this purpose. IV heparin has a shorter half-life and requires continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic levels, increasing the risk of fluctuations and potential bleeding complications.",

For high-risk surgery like TKA, they should be used in conjunction with, not as a replacement for, pharmacologic prophylaxis. SCDs promote venous return by intermittently compressing the legs, but they do not address the underlying hypercoagulable state that occurs after surgery.",

Placing support directly under the popliteal space promotes knee flexion and increases the risk of developing a flexion contracture, which can significantly impair long-term mobility and function. Prolonged knee flexion can lead to shortening of the posterior knee ligaments and muscles, resulting in a permanent limitation in knee extension.",

Assessing the pedal pulse, skin temperature, color, capillary refill, sensation, and motor function of the operative leg is a critical neurovascular check to promptly identify compromised circulation or nerve function, such as in compartment syndrome.

Homan's sign (pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the foot) is considered an unreliable and non-specific indicator for diagnosing DVT and is no longer recommended in clinical practice. Homan's sign has poor sensitivity and specificity for DVT, meaning it frequently produces false-negative and false-positive results.",

While assessing capillary refill is part of a perfusion assessment, checking the fingernails provides information about upper extremity or central perfusion, not the specific neurovascular status of the operative lower extremity. Capillary refill in the fingernails reflects overall systemic perfusion, while assessment of the lower extremity provides localized information about the surgical site.",
