    "introduction": "The client presents with polyuria, dilute urine (low specific gravity), hypotension, tachycardia, hypernatremia, and high serum osmolality post-TBI, indicative of central Diabetes Insipidus (DI). This condition arises from a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), crucial for renal water reabsorption. TBI can damage the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, disrupting ADH production/release. The resulting water loss leads to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Nursing interventions prioritize ADH replacement, fluid and electrolyte correction, and vigilant monitoring for neurological complications.",
