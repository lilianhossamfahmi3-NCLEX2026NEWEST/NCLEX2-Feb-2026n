        "correct": "The client's presentation of hypoxia (SpO2 89%), tachypnea (RR 32), use of accessory muscles, and inability to speak in full sentences are hallmark signs of acute respiratory failure. In a client with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, this is often caused by progressive weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to hypoventilation and an inability to clear secretions. The crackles and pedal edema also suggest a concurrent component of decompensated heart failure due to DMD-associated cardiomyopathy, which exacerbates respiratory distress. The priority is to address the failing respiratory effort. The immediate actions are to provide respiratory support with BiPAP to decrease the work of breathing and improve gas exchange, and to administer a diuretic like furosemide to reduce pulmonary congestion from fluid overload. The most critical parameters to monitor for response to these interventions are respiratory rate/work of breathing and oxygen saturation.",
        "incorrect": "While the client has findings consistent with decompensated heart failure and is at risk for pneumonia, the most immediate life-threatening condition is acute respiratory failure, which encompasses the inability to adequately oxygenate and ventilate. An anxiety attack would not cause hypoxia to this degree or the physical findings of fluid overload. A pulmonary embolism is less likely without other specific risk factors. Incorrect actions fail to address the primary issues of respiratory muscle fatigue and fluid overload. Incorrect monitoring parameters are not the most direct indicators of improvement in respiratory status.",
