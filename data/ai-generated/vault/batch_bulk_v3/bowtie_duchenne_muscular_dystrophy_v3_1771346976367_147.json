    "correct": "The client is most likely experiencing acute respiratory failure as evidenced by hypoxia (SpO2 89%), tachypnea (RR 32), use of accessory muscles, and inability to speak in full sentences. In DMD, progressive weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles leads to hypoventilation and ineffective secretion clearance. Crackles and edema suggest decompensated heart failure due to DMD-associated cardiomyopathy, exacerbating respiratory distress. Initiate BiPAP to decrease the work of breathing and improve gas exchange. Administer furosemide to reduce pulmonary congestion. Monitor respiratory rate/work of breathing and oxygen saturation to assess response to interventions.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** DMD causes progressive muscle degeneration, including respiratory muscles. This leads to decreased tidal volume, ineffective cough, and impaired gas exchange. Cardiomyopathy, common in DMD, contributes to fluid overload and pulmonary edema, further compromising respiratory function.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early recognition of respiratory distress in DMD is crucial. Proactive respiratory support can prevent intubation and improve outcomes.",

While other conditions may be present, they are not the priority. Incorrect actions may be harmful or ineffective in this situation. Incorrect monitoring parameters do not provide the most relevant information for assessing the client's response to treatment.\n\n**Pathophysiology of Incorrect Options:**\n*   **Decompensated Heart Failure:** While present, the respiratory failure is the immediate threat.\n*   **Anxiety Attack:** Does not explain the hypoxia or physical findings.\n*   **Pulmonary Embolism:** Less likely without specific risk factors.\n*   **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Possible, but respiratory muscle fatigue is the primary issue.\n\n**Clinical Pearls for Incorrect Options:**\n*   Differentiating between respiratory failure and other conditions requires careful assessment and consideration of the client's history.\n*   Addressing anxiety is important, but only after stabilizing the client's respiratory status.",

No fever is present, and crackles are likely due to atelectasis and/or fluid overload. **Pathophysiology:** Aspiration can lead to pneumonia, but the client's presentation is more consistent with respiratory muscle weakness. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess swallowing function and implement aspiration precautions, but prioritize addressing the respiratory failure."

Immobility is a risk factor, but the presentation is more consistent with gradual respiratory muscle fatigue characteristic of a DMD exacerbation, rather than acute pleuritic chest pain. **Pathophysiology:** PE involves a blood clot obstructing pulmonary arteries, leading to V/Q mismatch. **Clinical Pearl:** Consider PE if the client presents with sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain, but DMD exacerbation is more likely given the history."
