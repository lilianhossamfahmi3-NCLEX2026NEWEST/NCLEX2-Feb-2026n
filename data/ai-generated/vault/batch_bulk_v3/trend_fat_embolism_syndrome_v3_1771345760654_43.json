The deterioration from being alert and oriented to restless and then acutely confused (GCS drop from 15 to 13) is a classic and grave sign of FES. It indicates that fat emboli have reached the cerebral circulation, causing cerebral hypoxia, ischemia, and edema. This cerebral involvement is a direct threat to life and a key diagnostic feature of FES."
