Key interventions include prone positioning to avoid pressure on the sac, covering the sac with a sterile, moist dressing to prevent drying and infection, daily head circumference measurements to detect hydrocephalus, intermittent catheterization for neurogenic bladder, and using a radiant warmer for thermoregulation without placing clothing over the defect.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrectly matching interventions with rationales can lead to suboptimal care. For example, confusing the purpose of positioning (preventing rupture) with the purpose of dressings (preventing drying) could lead to improper care of the sac. Failing to understand the link between spina bifida and hydrocephalus or neurogenic bladder would result in missed assessments and delayed interventions for these serious complications.",

Placing the infant in a prone position is the single most important intervention to prevent pressure on the delicate myelomeningocele sac, which minimizes the risk of rupture and subsequent infection (meningitis).

A high percentage of infants with myelomeningocele develop hydrocephalus due to an associated Arnold-Chiari malformation, which obstructs cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.
