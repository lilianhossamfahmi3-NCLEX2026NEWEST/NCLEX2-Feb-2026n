On assessment, the right lower leg appears tense and swollen. The client reports numbness and tingling in his toes. Passive dorsiflexion of the right great toe elicits an extreme pain response. The dorsalis pedis pulse is faint but detectable with a Doppler. Capillary refill in the right great toe is 4 seconds."

The client's signs and symptoms are classic for acute compartment syndrome: pain disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by opioids, paresthesia (numbness/tingling), palpable tenseness of the compartment, and pain with passive muscle stretch. These are caused by increased pressure within a confined fascial space, compromising circulation and nerve function."

                "option": "Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While DVT is a risk, the clinical picture is not consistent. DVT typically presents with warmth, redness, and a dull ache or cramping, not the severe, burning pain, pallor, paresthesia, and pain on passive stretch seen here."

            {
                "option": "Fat Embolism Syndrome",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Fat Embolism Syndrome is a systemic complication of long bone fractures characterized by respiratory distress, neurological changes (e.g., confusion), and a petechial rash. The client's symptoms are localized to the injured limb."

                "option": "Inadequate Analgesia",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has severe pain, the presence of specific neurological and vascular signs (paresthesia, delayed capillary refill, pain on passive stretch) indicates a pathological process beyond simple inadequate pain control. The pain is a symptom of underlying ischemia."

            {
                "option": "Peripheral Nerve Entrapment",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Nerve entrapment could cause pain and paresthesia, but it would not typically account for the profound swelling, tenseness of the entire compartment, and vascular compromise (delayed capillary refill, faint pulse)."

                "rationale": "Correct. The limb should be kept flat or at heart level. Elevating the limb above the heart would decrease arterial inflow and worsen ischemia, while lowering it below the heart would increase edema and pressure. This position optimizes perfusion without increasing swelling."

                "option": "Elevate the affected limb on two pillows.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Elevating the limb is typically used to reduce edema, but in compartment syndrome, it can decrease arterial blood flow to the already compromised extremity, worsening ischemia. The limb should be kept at heart level."

                "option": "Apply a heating pad to the cast.",

It involves frequent assessment of the '6 Ps': pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia (coolness). Worsening of any of these indicates progression of the condition and requires immediate action."

                "rationale": "Correct. A severe complication of compartment syndrome is rhabdomyolysis, where damaged muscle cells release myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is nephrotoxic and can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). Monitoring urine output and color (for tea-colored urine) is essential to detect this systemic complication early."

            {
                "option": "Blood glucose levels",

The focus must be on the neurovascular compromise occurring *within* the limb, not superficial skin irritation."
