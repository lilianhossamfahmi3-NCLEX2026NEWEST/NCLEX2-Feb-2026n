    "correct": "The trend data reveals a rapid escalation of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and symptom severity over 32 hours, culminating in a BP of 210/122 mmHg and HR of 128 bpm. The client reports the 'worst headache ever' and profuse diaphoresis. This clinical picture strongly suggests a hypertensive crisis, a life-threatening complication of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that cause excessive release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This surge leads to intense vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and contractility, and ultimately, a dramatic rise in BP. Uncontrolled hypertension can cause end-organ damage, including stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and kidney failure. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.",
    "incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the client's vital signs are worsening, not stable. Option C is incorrect because hypovolemic shock presents with hypotension, not hypertension. While diaphoresis is present, the primary concern is the dangerously elevated BP. Option D is incorrect because the client's symptoms are worsening, not improving.",

Trend data from the past two days reveals a concerning pattern of escalating blood pressure, heart rate, headache intensity, and diaphoresis. At 1600 on Day 2, the client's blood pressure is 210/122 mmHg, heart rate is 128 bpm, headache is rated as 10/10 ('worst ever'), and diaphoresis is profuse.",

  "clinicalPearl": "When caring for a client with suspected pheochromocytoma, avoid palpating the abdomen, as this can trigger a catecholamine release and exacerbate hypertension. Ensure readily available rapid-acting antihypertensive medications, such as phentolamine or nitroprusside, to manage hypertensive crises. Monitor for signs of end-organ damage, such as altered mental status, chest pain, or decreased urine output.",
