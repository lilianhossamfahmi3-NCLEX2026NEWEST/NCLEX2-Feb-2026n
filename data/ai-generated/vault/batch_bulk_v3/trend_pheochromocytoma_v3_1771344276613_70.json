The final blood pressure reading of 210/122 mmHg, combined with a heart rate of 128/min and a report of the 'worst headache ever,' is indicative of a hypertensive crisis. This is a life-threatening complication of pheochromocytoma caused by an uncontrolled surge of catecholamines, which can lead to end-organ damage such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal failure.",
