    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client who is 4 hours post-operative following a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. The client has a chest tube connected to a water seal drainage system. The client is alert and oriented, reporting incisional pain of 5/10. Vital signs are: T 99.1°F (37.3°C), HR 88/min, RR 20/min, BP 134/78 mmHg, SpO2 94% on 2 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. The chest tube has drained 50 mL of serosanguinous fluid in the past hour, and tidaling is observed in the water seal chamber.",

        "correct": "The nurse must be able to differentiate between essential, safe nursing interventions and those that are unnecessary or potentially harmful for a client post-thoracic surgery with a chest tube. Essential actions include managing pain to facilitate pulmonary hygiene (deep breathing, coughing, ambulation) and maintaining the chest drainage system correctly with gravity. Contraindicated actions are those that can lead to life-threatening complications, such as clamping the tube (risking tension pneumothorax), aggressive stripping (damaging lung tissue), or improper positioning (compromising gas exchange). Recognizing normal findings, such as expected chest tube output, is also a key safety component, as it prevents unnecessary interventions and provider notifications.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting incorrect options demonstrates a misunderstanding of the principles of chest tube management and post-thoracic surgery care. Classifying a contraindicated action as essential or a necessary action as contraindicated can lead to significant client harm. Mistaking a normal finding for an abnormal one suggests a knowledge deficit in evaluating post-operative outcomes, leading to inefficient care.",

Adequate analgesia enables the client to deep breathe, cough, and ambulate, which are all vital for preventing atelectasis and pneumonia."

                "rationale": "This is Contraindicated. Clamping a chest tube is only done in specific, prescribed situations (e.g., changing the drainage system). Clamping obstructs the exit pathway for air and fluid from the pleural space, which can rapidly lead to a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening medical emergency."

                "rationale": "This is an Essential Action. The chest drainage unit must be kept below the level of the client's chest to use gravity to facilitate the drainage of air and fluid from the pleural space and to prevent backflow of drainage into the chest cavity."

                "rationale": "This is Not Indicated. Serosanguinous drainage of 50 mL in one hour is a normal and expected finding 4 hours post-lobectomy. Drainage is typically highest in the first 24 hours and should be less than 100-200 mL/hr. Notifying the provider is unnecessary and indicates the nurse cannot differentiate between normal and abnormal findings."

                "rationale": "This is Contraindicated. After a lobectomy, the client should not be positioned on the operative side for extended periods. This position restricts the expansion of the remaining lung tissue on the operative side and can compress the mediastinum, impairing gas exchange and ventilation of the 'good' lung. Semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position is preferred."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "This is Contraindicated. Aggressive stripping or 'milking' of chest tubes is not supported by evidence-based practice as it can generate dangerously high negative pressures (up to -400 cm H2O), potentially damaging delicate lung tissue, increasing bleeding, and causing significant pain. The tubing should only be gently manipulated if a clot is visible and obstructing flow."
