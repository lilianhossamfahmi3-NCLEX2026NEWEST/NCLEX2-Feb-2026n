  "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client who is 4 hours post-operative following a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. The client has a chest tube connected to a water seal drainage system. The client is alert and oriented, reporting incisional pain of 5/10. Vital signs are: T 37.3°C (99.1°F), HR 88/min, RR 20/min, BP 134/78 mmHg, SpO2 94% on 2 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. The chest tube has drained 50 mL of serosanguinous fluid in the past hour, and tidaling is observed in the water seal chamber.",

    "correct": "The nurse must prioritize safety and efficacy in post-thoracic surgery care. This includes differentiating essential interventions from those that are unnecessary or harmful. Essential actions facilitate recovery and prevent complications. Contraindicated actions pose significant risks. Recognizing normal post-operative findings prevents unnecessary interventions. The client is 4 hours post-op VATS lobectomy. Pain management is crucial for participation in pulmonary hygiene. Maintaining the chest drainage system below the chest promotes drainage and prevents backflow. Clamping the chest tube can cause tension pneumothorax. Aggressive stripping can damage lung tissue. Positioning on the operative side can impair gas exchange. 50mL/hr serosanguinous drainage is expected.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a lack of understanding of chest tube management and post-thoracic surgery care. Misclassifying actions can lead to client harm. Failing to recognize normal findings can result in inefficient care and unnecessary provider notifications.",

Adequate pain control enables the client to participate in deep breathing, coughing, and ambulation, preventing atelectasis and pneumonia. Uncontrolled pain inhibits these activities, increasing the risk of pulmonary complications. Clinical Pearl: Encourage splinting the incision with a pillow during coughing to minimize pain.",

        "rationale": "Contraindicated. Clamping a chest tube is generally avoided unless specifically prescribed (e.g., changing the drainage system or assessing for air leak). Clamping obstructs the exit pathway for air and fluid from the pleural space, potentially leading to a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space, compressing the lung and mediastinum, impairing venous return and cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Never clamp a chest tube without a specific order.",

This prevents backflow of drainage into the chest cavity, which could lead to infection or compromise lung expansion. The pressure gradient created by gravity assists in the removal of pleural contents. Clinical Pearl: Ensure the drainage unit is securely positioned to prevent accidental tipping or breakage.",

        "rationale": "Not Indicated. Serosanguinous drainage of 50 mL in one hour is a normal and expected finding 4 hours post-lobectomy. Drainage is typically highest in the first 24 hours and should be less than 100-200 mL/hr. Notifying the provider is unnecessary and indicates the nurse cannot differentiate between normal and abnormal findings. Post-lobectomy, some bleeding is expected as the surgical site heals. Clinical Pearl: Monitor drainage color and consistency; report any sudden changes (e.g., bright red blood, purulent drainage).",

        "rationale": "Contraindicated. After a lobectomy, the client should not be positioned on the operative side for extended periods. This position restricts the expansion of the remaining lung tissue on the operative side and can compress the mediastinum, impairing gas exchange and ventilation of the 'good' lung. Semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position is preferred to optimize lung expansion and ventilation. Clinical Pearl: Encourage frequent position changes to promote optimal lung function.",

        "rationale": "Contraindicated. Aggressive stripping or 'milking' of chest tubes is not supported by evidence-based practice as it can generate dangerously high negative pressures (up to -400 cm H2O), potentially damaging delicate lung tissue, increasing bleeding, and causing significant pain. The tubing should only be gently manipulated if a clot is visible and obstructing flow. High negative pressure can cause alveolar damage and increase the risk of air leaks. Clinical Pearl: Gentle manipulation of the tubing is acceptable only if a visible clot is present.",
