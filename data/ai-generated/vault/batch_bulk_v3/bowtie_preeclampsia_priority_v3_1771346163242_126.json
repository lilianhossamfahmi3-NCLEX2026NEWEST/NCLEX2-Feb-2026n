The priority is to recognize this life-threatening condition (Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity), immediately stop the infusion to prevent further toxicity (Action), and administer the antidote, calcium gluconate, to reverse the effects (Action). The most critical parameters to monitor are respiratory rate (to assess for reversal of respiratory depression, the most life-threatening complication) and deep tendon reflexes (as their return indicates decreasing toxicity).",
