    "correct": "The client's clinical presentation at 1500 indicates magnesium sulfate toxicity. A respiratory rate of 10/min, slurred speech, somnolence, and absent deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are classic signs. Magnesium sulfate, used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia, can cause central nervous system (CNS) depression at toxic levels (above 7 mEq/L). This occurs because magnesium blocks calcium channels, inhibiting neurotransmitter release and causing neuromuscular blockade. The priority is to immediately stop the magnesium sulfate infusion (Action) to prevent further CNS and respiratory depression. Administering calcium gluconate IV (Action) is crucial as it antagonizes magnesium's effects by increasing the availability of calcium, restoring neuromuscular function. Closely monitor respiratory rate and effort (Parameter) for signs of improvement, as respiratory depression is the most life-threatening complication. Monitor DTRs (Parameter) to assess the reversal of neuromuscular blockade.",
    "incorrect": "An impending seizure (eclampsia) typically presents with hyperreflexia and clonus, opposite of the client's absent reflexes. A cerebrovascular accident (CVA) would likely cause focal neurological deficits, not global CNS depression. While hydralazine lowers blood pressure, the immediate threat is respiratory depression from magnesium toxicity. Preparing for a cesarean section is premature; maternal stabilization is paramount. Monitoring urine output and fetal heart rate are important but secondary to addressing the immediate respiratory and neurological compromise.",
