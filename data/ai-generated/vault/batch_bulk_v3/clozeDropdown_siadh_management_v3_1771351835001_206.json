The nurse assesses the client and notes lethargy and disorientation to time and place. Laboratory results show a serum sodium of 118 mEq/L, serum osmolality of 255 mOsm/kg, urine sodium of 55 mEq/L, and urine osmolality of 490 mOsm/kg. The provider diagnoses Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH).\n\nThe nurse reviews the new orders and plans the client's care. The nurse's priority action is to **[Blank 1]**. To correct the severe hyponatremia, the nurse will prepare to administer **[Blank 2]**. A key ongoing intervention will be to implement **[Blank 3]**. The nurse must vigilantly monitor the client's **[Blank 4]** during treatment.",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "blank1": {
            "Initiate seizure precautions": "Correct. A serum sodium level below 120 mEq/L, especially with neurological symptoms like confusion and lethargy, places the client at high risk for seizures due to cerebral edema. This is a critical safety intervention.",
            "Encourage increased oral fluid intake": "Incorrect. In SIADH, the body retains excess free water, causing dilutional hyponatremia. Encouraging fluid intake would worsen the fluid overload and further lower the serum sodium level.",
            "Administer a bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride": "Incorrect. While isotonic, 0.9% NaCl would not effectively raise the serum sodium in a client with SIADH. The body would retain the water from the solution and excrete the sodium, potentially worsening the hyponatremia.",
            "Insert an indwelling urinary catheter": "Incorrect. While monitoring urine output is important, it is not the immediate priority. The client's safety from potential seizures takes precedence over obtaining precise output measurements at this moment."
        },
        "blank2": {
            "3% hypertonic saline infusion": "Correct. For severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Na < 120 mEq/L with neurological changes), a slow infusion of hypertonic saline is indicated. This solution has a higher concentration of sodium than the blood, helping to pull water out of the swollen brain cells and slowly raise the serum sodium level.",
            "0.45% sodium chloride infusion": "Incorrect. This is a hypotonic solution. Administering it would add more free water to the system, further diluting the serum sodium and exacerbating cerebral edema, which is extremely dangerous.",
            "Furosemide intravenously": "Incorrect. While a loop diuretic like furosemide may be used in SIADH management, it is typically administered along with hypertonic saline to promote the excretion of free water. It is not the primary intervention to correct the critically low sodium level itself and can worsen hyponatremia if given alone.",
            "Dextrose 5% in water (D5W)": "Incorrect. D5W is an isotonic solution in the bag but becomes hypotonic in the body as the dextrose is metabolized, leaving only free water. This is strictly contraindicated as it would rapidly and severely worsen the hyponatremia."
        },
        "blank3": {
            "A strict fluid restriction": "Correct. This is a cornerstone of SIADH management. Limiting fluid intake (e.g., 800-1000 mL/day) prevents further dilution of serum sodium and allows the kidneys to excrete excess water, gradually correcting the imbalance.",
            "A low-sodium diet": "Incorrect. The client's problem is an excess of water, not an excess of sodium. A sodium-restricted diet is inappropriate and could hinder recovery. In some cases of chronic SIADH, salt tablets may even be prescribed along with fluid restriction.",
            "Administration of desmopressin": "Incorrect. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic form of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Since SIADH is a state of excessive ADH, giving more would worsen the condition significantly.",
            "Hourly ambulation": "Incorrect. While mobility is generally encouraged, this client is lethargic, confused, and at high risk for seizures. Ambulation is not a safe or priority intervention at this time."
        },
        "blank4": {
            "Neurological status": "Correct. The most significant risks associated with severe hyponatremia are neurological (cerebral edema, seizures, coma). Furthermore, overly rapid correction of sodium can lead to a devastating neurological condition called osmotic demyelination syndrome. Therefore, frequent and careful monitoring of the client's level of consciousness, orientation, and motor function is the highest monitoring priority.",
            "Hourly urine output": "Incorrect. Monitoring intake and output is essential for managing fluid balance, but changes in neurological status are a more direct and immediate indicator of the life-threatening complications of both the condition and its treatment.",
            "Serum potassium levels": "Incorrect. While all electrolytes are important, the critical imbalance in SIADH is sodium and water. Potassium is not the primary electrolyte of concern and monitoring it is not the highest priority.",
            "Peripheral edema": "Incorrect. SIADH is characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia, meaning there is fluid retention but not typically significant peripheral edema (pitting edema). Therefore, monitoring for this finding is not a sensitive or priority indicator of the client's fluid status or response to treatment."
