        "stem": "A 45-year-old client, admitted for major depressive disorder, is being treated with paroxetine, ondansetron, and tramadol. During the morning assessment, the nurse finds the client agitated, confused, and profusely diaphoretic. Vital signs are: T 39.8°C (103.6°F), HR 135/min, BP 170/100 mmHg, RR 28/min. The nurse notes hyperreflexia and inducible clonus in both lower extremities. The nurse suspects serotonin syndrome and receives orders from the healthcare provider. In which order should the nurse implement the actions?",

        "correct": "The priority order of interventions for serotonin syndrome focuses on removing the cause, providing immediate life support and stabilization, and then administering specific treatments and monitoring for complications. The first action is to discontinue all serotonergic agents (withholding paroxetine). Next, immediate physiological monitoring (cardiac and SpO2) is critical to detect life-threatening arrhythmias and hypoxia. Administering IV lorazepam is the third step, as it is the first-line treatment for agitation, seizure-like activity, and myoclonus, and it helps reduce hyperthermia by decreasing muscle activity. The fourth step is to apply a cooling blanket to directly manage the severe hyperthermia, a major cause of mortality. Administering cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, is a subsequent action for moderate-to-severe cases once initial stabilization is underway. Finally, obtaining a CK level is important for monitoring for rhabdomyolysis but is not an immediate life-saving intervention.",
