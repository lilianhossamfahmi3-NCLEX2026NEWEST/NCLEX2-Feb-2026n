This involves evaluating potential adverse effects and drug-food interactions in the context of the client's comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes). The CJMM step is 'Generate Solutions,' as the nurse must determine the most appropriate intervention (priority teaching) to prevent a life-threatening complication."

        "rationale": "This is incorrect. While orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing) is a common and important side effect of phenelzine, it is not the most life-threatening risk. This instruction is necessary for fall prevention but is secondary in priority to preventing a hypertensive crisis."

        "rationale": "This is correct. Phenelzine is an MAOI that inhibits the breakdown of tyramine. Ingesting tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented products, certain alcoholic beverages) can lead to a massive release of norepinephrine, precipitating a hypertensive crisis. This is a medical emergency characterized by a sudden, severe increase in blood pressure, headache, and palpitations, which can lead to stroke or death. Given the client's pre-existing hypertension, this risk is especially critical, making it the absolute priority for teaching."

        "rationale": "This is incorrect. This statement is true, as antidepressants, including MAOIs, can take 4-6 weeks to reach full therapeutic effect. Educating the client on this therapeutic lag is important for promoting medication adherence. However, it does not address an immediate, life-threatening safety risk and is therefore not the priority over preventing a hypertensive crisis."

MAOIs can potentiate the effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemics, potentially causing hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia. While monitoring blood glucose is relevant for a client with diabetes, the most acute and potentially fatal risk associated with this medication is a hypertensive crisis from dietary indiscretion."

Consuming tyramine-rich foods (aged cheese, cured meats, fermented products, red wine) while taking phenelzine can lead to a hypertensive crisis. Tyramine causes a massive release of norepinephrine, leading to severe hypertension, headache, palpitations, and potentially stroke or death. Given the client's pre-existing hypertension, this interaction poses an immediate and life-threatening risk. This teaching is the priority.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Provide a detailed list of foods to avoid while taking MAOIs. Emphasize the importance of strict dietary adherence to prevent hypertensive crisis. Teach signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis and instruct the client to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.",
      "pathophysiology": "MAOIs inhibit monoamine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down monoamines like tyramine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. When tyramine is not broken down, it accumulates and causes a surge of norepinephrine release from nerve terminals. This excessive norepinephrine leads to intense vasoconstriction and a rapid, dangerous increase in blood pressure."

While it is important to educate the client about this therapeutic lag to promote adherence, this does not address an immediate safety risk. The risk of hypertensive crisis is more immediate and potentially fatal.",
