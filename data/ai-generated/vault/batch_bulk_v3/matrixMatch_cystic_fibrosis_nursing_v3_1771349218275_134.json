For each potential nursing intervention, click to specify if it is an 'Essential', 'Non-Essential', or 'Contraindicated' action for this client's immediate plan of care.",

            "column": "Essential Action",
            "rationale": "Dornase alfa is a mucolytic enzyme that works by cleaving extracellular DNA in purulent sputum, which decreases its viscosity. Administering this medication before chest physiotherapy (CPT) makes airway clearance techniques more effective at mobilizing the thinned secretions, which is a priority for a client with a pulmonary exacerbation and hypoxia."

            "row": "Initiate and maintain strict contact and droplet precautions.",
            "column": "Essential Action",
            "rationale": "Infection control is paramount. Clients with cystic fibrosis are susceptible to colonization with multi-drug resistant organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex). Standard, contact, and droplet precautions protect the client from acquiring new pathogens and prevent the spread of their current organisms to other vulnerable clients, especially other clients with CF."

            "row": "Administer pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack.",
            "column": "Essential Action",
            "rationale": "Cystic fibrosis causes pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption of fats, proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins. Administering replacement enzymes with all food intake is essential to ensure adequate nutrient absorption, promote weight gain, and meet the increased metabolic demands associated with acute illness and infection."

            "row": "Provide a PRN dose of an opioid antitussive for severe coughing.",
            "column": "Contraindicated Action",
            "rationale": "The productive cough is a critical protective mechanism for clearing the thick, tenacious mucus from the airways in cystic fibrosis. Suppressing this reflex with an antitussive, especially an opioid like codeine, can lead to retained secretions, mucus plugging, atelectasis, and worsening respiratory failure. This action is dangerous and strictly contraindicated."

            "column": "Contraindicated Action",
            "rationale": "Clients with cystic fibrosis require increased fluid intake, not restriction. Adequate hydration is crucial to decrease the viscosity of respiratory secretions, making them easier to expectorate. Dehydration would thicken the mucus, exacerbating airway obstruction and increasing the risk of respiratory compromise."

            "rationale": "Cross-infection is a significant risk for clients with cystic fibrosis. Cohorting or allowing close contact with other children, especially those with other respiratory illnesses or other clients with CF, is contraindicated. This policy prevents the transmission of virulent pathogens (e.g., B. cepacia) that can lead to rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Individual play and appropriate developmental activities should be provided in the client's room."

        "description": "The nurse must evaluate a series of potential interventions for a child with a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. This requires prioritizing actions that are essential for immediate care (airway clearance, nutrition, infection control) while correctly identifying and rejecting interventions that are non-essential or harmful (cough suppression, fluid restriction, exposure to others). This demonstrates the ability to organize and rank interventions based on urgency, risk, and physiological needs."
