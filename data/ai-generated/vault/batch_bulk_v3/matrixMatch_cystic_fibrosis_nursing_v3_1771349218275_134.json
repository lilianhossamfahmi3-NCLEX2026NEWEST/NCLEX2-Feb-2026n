      "row": "Administer dornase alfa via nebulizer prior to chest physiotherapy.",
      "column": "Essential Action",
      "rationale": "Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is a mucolytic enzyme that breaks down extracellular DNA in sputum, decreasing its viscosity. In cystic fibrosis (CF), thick mucus obstructs airways, leading to infection and impaired gas exchange. Administering dornase alfa via nebulizer before chest physiotherapy (CPT) thins secretions, facilitating their mobilization and expectoration during CPT. This improves airway clearance and oxygenation. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for voice alteration or pharyngitis as potential side effects.",

      "row": "Initiate and maintain strict contact and droplet precautions.",
      "column": "Essential Action",
      "rationale": "Clients with CF are highly susceptible to respiratory infections, including multi-drug resistant organisms like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Burkholderia cepacia*. These infections can cause rapid lung function decline. Strict contact and droplet precautions prevent cross-contamination between clients and healthcare personnel. This includes wearing gowns, gloves, and masks when in close contact with the client. Clinical Pearl: Dedicated equipment should be used for CF patients to prevent cross-contamination.",

      "row": "Administer pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack.",
      "column": "Essential Action",
      "rationale": "CF causes pancreatic insufficiency, impairing the digestion and absorption of fats, proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is essential to improve nutrient absorption, promote weight gain, and prevent malnutrition. Enzymes should be administered with every meal and snack, as the body cannot produce enough on its own. Dosage is individualized based on stool output and fat content. Clinical Pearl: Enzymes should be taken at the beginning of the meal.",

      "row": "Provide a PRN dose of an opioid antitussive for severe coughing.",
      "column": "Contraindicated Action",
      "rationale": "A productive cough is a crucial mechanism for clearing thick mucus from the airways in CF. Opioid antitussives (e.g., codeine) suppress the cough reflex, leading to mucus retention, airway obstruction, atelectasis, and increased risk of pneumonia. This can worsen respiratory failure and hypoxia. The goal is to facilitate mucus clearance, not suppress it. Clinical Pearl: Encourage coughing and deep breathing exercises instead.",

      "column": "Contraindicated Action",
      "rationale": "Adequate hydration is vital in CF to thin respiratory secretions, making them easier to expectorate. Fluid restriction would thicken the mucus, exacerbating airway obstruction and increasing the risk of respiratory compromise. Dehydration can also impair mucociliary clearance. Increased fluid intake is generally recommended, unless contraindicated by other medical conditions. Clinical Pearl: Monitor urine output and signs of dehydration.",

      "column": "Contraindicated Action",
      "rationale": "Cross-infection is a major concern in CF. Clients with CF are at risk of acquiring virulent pathogens, such as *B. cepacia*, from other CF patients or individuals with respiratory infections. These pathogens can cause rapid lung function decline and increased mortality. Cohorting or allowing close contact with other children, especially in a playroom setting, increases the risk of transmission. Individual play and developmentally appropriate activities should be provided in the client's room. Clinical Pearl: Strict adherence to infection control protocols is essential.",

    "stepName": "Prioritize Hypotheses",
    "description": "The nurse must evaluate a series of potential interventions for a child with a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. This requires prioritizing actions that are essential for immediate care (airway clearance, nutrition, infection control) while correctly identifying and rejecting interventions that are non-essential or harmful (cough suppression, fluid restriction, exposure to others). This demonstrates the ability to organize and rank interventions based on urgency, risk, and physiological needs."

    "situation": "A 9-year-old child is admitted with a cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation, presenting with productive cough, thick yellow-green sputum, coarse crackles, SpO2 91% on room air, and decreased appetite.",
    "background": "The child has a history of cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency. Current symptoms indicate a respiratory infection and increased mucus production, leading to impaired gas exchange.",
    "assessment": "The child's respiratory status is compromised, evidenced by low SpO2 and coarse crackles. The productive cough indicates the need for airway clearance. Decreased appetite suggests potential nutritional deficits.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate dornase alfa via nebulizer before chest physiotherapy to thin secretions. Implement strict contact and droplet precautions to prevent cross-infection. Administer pancreatic enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to improve nutrient absorption. Avoid opioid antitussives and fluid restriction, as they are contraindicated. Provide individual play activities in the child's room."
