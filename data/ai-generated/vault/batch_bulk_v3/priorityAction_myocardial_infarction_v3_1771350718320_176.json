    "stem": "A 68-year-old male is in the cardiac step-down unit 2 hours after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement via the right femoral artery for an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He is receiving a continuous intravenous heparin infusion. The client suddenly reports the onset of severe, sharp lower back pain, rating it as 8/10. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following findings: blood pressure 98/60 mmHg, heart rate 112/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and SpO2 96% on 2 L nasal cannula. His groin access site has no visible bleeding or hematoma. Which action should the nurse take first?",

                "option": "Assess the femoral artery access site for bleeding.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While assessing the access site is an important part of post-PCI care, the client's symptoms (severe back pain, tachycardia, hypotension) in the absence of external bleeding at the groin are classic signs of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. This is an internal bleed. Checking the external site will not identify the source of the problem and delays a more critical intervention."
            },
            {
                "option": "Stop the intravenous heparin infusion.",
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's clinical presentation is highly suggestive of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, a life-threatening complication of femoral artery catheterization. The heparin infusion is preventing clot formation and exacerbating the internal bleeding. The most critical, immediate action is to stop the anticoagulant to prevent further blood loss and hemodynamic collapse. This action directly addresses the cause of the client's instability."
            },
            {
                "option": "Administer the prescribed morphine for pain.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Although the client is in severe pain, the pain is a symptom of a serious underlying condition (internal bleeding). Administering an opioid like morphine could mask the progression of symptoms and its vasodilatory effects could further decrease the client's blood pressure, worsening the hemodynamic instability. The priority is to treat the cause, not the symptom."
            },
            {
                "option": "Request an order for a STAT complete blood count (CBC).",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. A CBC would confirm blood loss by showing a drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit, but this is a diagnostic action that takes time. The client is showing clear clinical signs of acute hemorrhage requiring immediate intervention. The nurse should act on the strong clinical suspicion rather than waiting for lab confirmation, as any delay could be life-threatening."
            },
            {
                "option": "Place the client in a Trendelenburg position.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While placing a client with hypotension in the Trendelenburg or modified Trendelenburg position can temporarily increase venous return and blood pressure, it does not solve the underlying problem of active bleeding. The priority is to stop the source of the hemorrhage by discontinuing the heparin infusion. This positioning maneuver can be considered as a supportive measure but is not the first and most crucial action."
