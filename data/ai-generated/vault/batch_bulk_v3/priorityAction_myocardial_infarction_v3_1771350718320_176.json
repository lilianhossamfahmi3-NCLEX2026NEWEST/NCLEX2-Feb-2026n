  "stem": "A 68-year-old male is in the cardiac step-down unit 2 hours after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement via the right femoral artery for an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He is receiving a continuous intravenous heparin infusion. The client suddenly reports the onset of severe, sharp lower back pain, rating it as 8/10. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following findings: blood pressure 98/60 mmHg, heart rate 112/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and SpO2 96% on 2 L nasal cannula. His groin access site has no visible bleeding or hematoma. Which action should the nurse take first?",

        "option": "Stop the intravenous heparin infusion.",
        "rationale": "Correct. The client's sudden onset of severe back pain, hypotension (98/60 mmHg), and tachycardia (112/min) post-PCI, in the absence of visible bleeding at the femoral access site, strongly suggests a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. This is a life-threatening complication where bleeding occurs into the retroperitoneal space. Heparin, an anticoagulant, exacerbates this bleeding. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** PCI via the femoral artery can cause arterial damage, leading to bleeding. Heparin prevents clot formation, worsening the hemorrhage. The accumulating blood in the retroperitoneal space causes pain by compressing nerves and tissues. Blood loss leads to hypovolemia, resulting in hypotension and compensatory tachycardia. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Retroperitoneal bleeds can be subtle. Back pain, flank pain, or abdominal pain post-femoral artery procedures should raise suspicion. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent hemodynamic collapse and death. The nurse should immediately stop the heparin infusion to mitigate further bleeding. Notify the provider immediately after stopping the infusion. Prepare for fluid resuscitation and potential blood transfusion. Monitor vital signs closely every 5-15 minutes. \n\n**SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation):**\n*   **Situation (1400):** 68-year-old male, post-PCI (2 hours ago) with stent placement, now reporting severe back pain (8/10).\n*   **Background:** History of anterior STEMI, PCI via right femoral artery, continuous heparin infusion.\n*   **Assessment:** BP 98/60 mmHg, HR 112/min, RR 20/min, SpO2 96% on 2L NC. No visible bleeding at the groin access site. Suspect retroperitoneal hemorrhage.\n*   **Recommendation:** I have stopped the heparin infusion due to suspected retroperitoneal bleed. Requesting immediate evaluation, STAT CBC, and orders for fluid resuscitation and potential blood transfusion. Please advise.",

        "option": "Place the client in a Trendelenburg position.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While Trendelenburg position *might* transiently increase venous return, it does not address the underlying cause of the hypotension, which is active bleeding. Furthermore, it can worsen respiratory distress and is generally not recommended as a first-line intervention for hypotension. The priority is to stop the bleeding. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Trendelenburg increases venous return by gravity, but it also increases intrathoracic pressure, potentially impairing ventilation. It does not stop the hemorrhage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Trendelenburg is rarely used in modern practice for hypotension due to its limited effectiveness and potential adverse effects. Fluid resuscitation and addressing the underlying cause are more effective.",

        "option": "Request an order for a STAT complete blood count (CBC).",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a CBC is important to quantify the blood loss, obtaining the order and waiting for the results delays critical treatment. The client's clinical presentation strongly suggests a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, warranting immediate action to stop the bleeding. Waiting for lab confirmation could lead to further deterioration and compromise the client's outcome. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** A CBC will show decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, confirming blood loss. However, the results are not immediately available. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In emergency situations, act on clinical judgment. Do not delay critical interventions while waiting for lab results.",

        "option": "Assess the femoral artery access site for bleeding.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The stem specifically states that there is no visible bleeding or hematoma at the groin access site. While assessing the access site is a standard post-PCI nursing intervention, the client's severe back pain, hypotension, and tachycardia, in the *absence* of local bleeding, point towards an internal hemorrhage (retroperitoneal). Focusing solely on the access site delays the recognition and treatment of the more critical problem. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Retroperitoneal hemorrhages occur internally, with blood accumulating in the retroperitoneal space. The groin site may appear normal. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always consider internal bleeding in patients post-femoral artery procedures, even if the access site looks normal.",

        "option": "Administer the prescribed morphine for pain.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While pain management is important, administering morphine is not the priority. The pain is a symptom of a potentially life-threatening condition (retroperitoneal hemorrhage). Morphine can also cause vasodilation, further lowering the blood pressure and masking the progression of the hemorrhage. Addressing the underlying cause of the pain is the priority. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Morphine is an opioid analgesic that can cause vasodilation and respiratory depression. Vasodilation worsens hypotension. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Treat the cause, not just the symptom. In unstable patients, avoid medications that can mask symptoms or worsen hemodynamic instability.",
