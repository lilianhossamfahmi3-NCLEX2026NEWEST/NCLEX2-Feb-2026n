The client states he has been recovering from the flu for the past 4 days and is concerned because he feels 'worse today'. The nurse documents the client's report.",

Reports [still feeling more tired than usual]. His [eyelids feel heavy by the evening], and he has some [double vision when I'm watching TV]. He notes increasing [difficulty swallowing his food] this morning and says his [voice sounds quieter]. He also mentions feeling like he [can't seem to take a deep breath]. When asked about medications, he reports he [ran out of my pyridostigmine yesterday] and hasn't taken a dose in 24 hours.",

However, a resolving low-grade fever is part of the precipitating illness, not the most critical current finding. The focus should be on the consequences of the illness, such as respiratory and bulbar weakness.",
