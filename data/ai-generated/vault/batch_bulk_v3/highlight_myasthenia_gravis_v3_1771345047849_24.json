  "stem": "A triage nurse at a neurology clinic receives a call at 1000 from a 48-year-old client with a 5-year history of myasthenia gravis. The client states he has been recovering from the flu for the past 4 days and is concerned because he feels 'worse today'. The nurse documents the client's report using SBAR.",
  "prompt": "Using the client's statement, highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up. (120-160 words)",
  "textToHighlight": "Client reports recovering from a recent viral illness. States he had a [low-grade fever of 99.8°F (37.7°C)] yesterday, but it is gone today. Reports [still feeling more tired than usual]. His [eyelids feel heavy by the evening], and he has some [double vision when I'm watching TV]. He notes increasing [difficulty swallowing his food] this morning and says his [voice sounds quieter]. He also mentions feeling like he [can't seem to take a deep breath]. When asked about medications, he reports he [ran out of my pyridostigmine yesterday] and hasn't taken a dose in 24 hours.",

    "prompt": "The nurse must identify cues indicating a potential myasthenic crisis, a life-threatening complication of myasthenia gravis. This crisis results from insufficient acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to severe muscle weakness, especially in respiratory and bulbar muscles. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent respiratory failure and aspiration.",

        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the recent viral illness likely triggered the exacerbation, a resolving low-grade fever is less critical than the current signs of respiratory and bulbar weakness. The focus should be on the consequences of the illness, not the illness itself.",

This is a critical finding because it poses an immediate risk of aspiration and respiratory failure, signaling a potential myasthenic crisis. The pathophysiology involves weakness of the muscles controlling swallowing, increasing the risk of food or liquids entering the airway.

This is a significant bulbar sign that often accompanies dysphagia, indicating worsening weakness that can compromise the airway. The vocal cords are weakened, leading to a soft or hoarse voice. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for changes in speech patterns as an early indicator of worsening condition.",

This indicates impending respiratory failure, a hallmark of myasthenic crisis. Weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles reduces the ability to expand the lungs fully. Clinical Pearl: Assess respiratory rate, depth, and effort. Prepare for possible intubation.",

        "rationale": "Correct. This provides critical context. Missing doses of pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is a primary trigger for myasthenic crisis. This explains the acute worsening of symptoms and underscores the urgency. Without the medication, acetylcholine is rapidly broken down, leading to muscle weakness. Clinical Pearl: Reinforce medication adherence and importance of maintaining consistent blood levels.",
