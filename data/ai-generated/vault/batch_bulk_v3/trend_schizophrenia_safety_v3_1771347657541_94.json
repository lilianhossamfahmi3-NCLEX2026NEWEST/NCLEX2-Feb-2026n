He has a history of medication non-adherence. Upon admission, he was highly agitated, expressing paranoid delusions that he was part of a government experiment called 'Batch 300', and reported auditory hallucinations. He was started on olanzapine 10 mg PO daily.",

Ate 100% of pre-packaged snacks and a sandwich after opening them himself. Still refusing unit-prepared meals. Slept for 4 hours last night."
