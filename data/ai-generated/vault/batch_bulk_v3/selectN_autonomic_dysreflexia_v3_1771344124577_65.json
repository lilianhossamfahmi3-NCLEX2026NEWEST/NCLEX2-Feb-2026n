        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia, a medical emergency common in clients with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury, leading to an unopposed sympathetic nervous system response that causes severe hypertension. Immediate nursing priorities are to lower the blood pressure and remove the stimulus. This involves sitting the client upright (high-Fowler's position) to induce orthostatic hypotension, removing any constrictive items (like anti-embolism stockings), identifying and correcting the most common cause (bladder distention by checking the catheter), and administering prescribed rapid-acting antihypertensives to prevent complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "incorrect": "Actions that would worsen the condition or fail to address the life-threatening hypertension are incorrect. Placing the client in a supine or flat position will further elevate their blood pressure. Treating the headache with an opioid is inappropriate as the headache is a symptom of the hypertension; addressing the hypertension will resolve the headache. A digital rectal exam is a secondary assessment after bladder issues are ruled out, as it can worsen the sympathetic stimulation if not done correctly.",
