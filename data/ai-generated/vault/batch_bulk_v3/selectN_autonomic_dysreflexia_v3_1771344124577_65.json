    "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden onset of severe hypertension and associated symptoms. AD occurs in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. A noxious stimulus below the level of the injury triggers an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response because the brain cannot regulate it. This leads to vasoconstriction and a rapid increase in blood pressure. The body attempts to compensate via the vagus nerve, resulting in bradycardia. Immediate interventions are crucial to prevent stroke, seizure, or even death. \n\n**Prioritized actions include:**\n1.  **Elevate the head of the bed (High-Fowler's):** This promotes orthostatic hypotension, helping to lower blood pressure.\n2.  **Assess and address the most common cause: bladder distention.** Check for kinks, obstructions, or sediment in the urinary catheter. If the catheter is patent, consider irrigating it to ensure proper drainage.\n3.  **Remove any constrictive clothing or devices:** Anti-embolism stockings can act as a noxious stimulus.\n4.  **Administer prescribed antihypertensive medication:** Nifedipine is a common choice due to its rapid onset of action. Monitor blood pressure closely after administration.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always consider autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injuries above T6 presenting with sudden hypertension, headache, and bradycardia. Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing severe complications.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either fail to address the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia or could worsen the client's condition. Lowering the head of the bed increases cerebral blood flow and further elevates blood pressure. Administering morphine only treats the symptom (headache) and does not address the life-threatening hypertension. A digital rectal exam, while potentially necessary, is not the immediate priority and can further stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.",
