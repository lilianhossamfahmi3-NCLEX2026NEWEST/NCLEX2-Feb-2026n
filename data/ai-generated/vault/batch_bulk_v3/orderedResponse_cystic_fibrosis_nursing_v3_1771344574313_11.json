    "rationale": "This question requires the nurse to correctly sequence a series of prescribed interventions. This aligns with the 'Take Actions' step of the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, as the nurse must implement solutions based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis and the mechanism of action of each therapy to achieve the optimal clinical outcome."

    {
      "option": "opt_1",
      "step": 1,
      "label": "Administer nebulized albuterol.",
      "rationale": "Albuterol, a short-acting beta-2 agonist, causes bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways. This allows for increased airflow and improved penetration of subsequent inhaled medications. In CF, bronchoconstriction can be triggered by airway inflammation and hypertonic saline. Administering albuterol first helps to prevent or reduce this bronchospasm. Clinical Pearl: Always assess the patient's heart rate before and after albuterol administration, as it can cause tachycardia.",
      "correct": true
    },
    {
      "option": "opt_3",
      "step": 2,
      "label": "Administer nebulized 7% hypertonic saline.",
      "rationale": "Hypertonic saline (7%) increases the osmolarity of the airway surface liquid, drawing water from the underlying tissues into the airways. This hydrates and thins the thick, tenacious mucus characteristic of CF, facilitating its clearance. The increased water content also stimulates cough. It is administered after the bronchodilator to maximize its distribution and minimize the risk of bronchospasm. Clinical Pearl: Monitor the patient for bronchospasm during and after hypertonic saline administration. Have a bronchodilator readily available.",
      "correct": true
    },
    {
      "option": "opt_5",
      "step": 3,
      "label": "Administer nebulized dornase alfa.",
      "rationale": "Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (DNase) that selectively cleaves extracellular DNA. In CF, neutrophil-mediated inflammation leads to an accumulation of DNA in the sputum, which significantly increases its viscosity. By breaking down this DNA, dornase alfa reduces mucus viscosity, making it easier to clear. It is most effective when administered after the airways have been opened by the bronchodilator and the mucus has been hydrated by the hypertonic saline. Clinical Pearl: Dornase alfa should be protected from light and should be administered using a specific nebulizer.",
      "correct": true

    {
      "option": "opt_4",
      "step": 4,
      "label": "Perform high-frequency chest wall oscillation (vest therapy).",
      "rationale": "High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) uses an inflatable vest that vibrates at a high frequency. These vibrations create pressure pulses that loosen mucus from the walls of the smaller airways and move it into the larger, central airways where it can be coughed out. This mechanical clearance is most effective after medications have worked to open airways and thin mucus. Clinical Pearl: Ensure the vest fits properly and that the patient is comfortable. Monitor the patient for skin irritation under the vest.",
      "correct": true

    {
      "option": "opt_2",
      "step": 5,
      "label": "Assist the client with huff coughing techniques.",
      "rationale": "Huff coughing (forced expiratory technique) is a method used to clear secretions that have been mobilized into the large airways by the vest therapy. It involves taking a deep breath and then exhaling forcefully in a series of three breaths with an open glottis, preventing the airway collapse associated with traditional coughing. This technique is more effective and less fatiguing than traditional coughing for clients with CF. This action directly removes the secretions from the body, completing the goal of the airway clearance therapy. Clinical Pearl: Teach the patient how to perform huff coughing effectively. Encourage them to splint their abdomen if they have pain.",
