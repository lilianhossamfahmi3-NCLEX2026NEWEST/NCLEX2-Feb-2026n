This aligns with the 'Take Actions' step of the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, as the nurse must implement solutions based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis and the mechanism of action of each therapy to achieve the optimal clinical outcome."

            "step": 1,
            "label": "Administer nebulized albuterol.",
            "rationale": "This is the correct first step. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that causes bronchodilation. Administering it first opens the airways, which allows subsequent inhaled medications to penetrate deeper into the lungs. It also helps to prevent or reduce bronchospasm that can be induced by the hypertonic saline."

            "step": 2,
            "label": "Administer nebulized 7% hypertonic saline.",
            "rationale": "This is the correct second step. Hypertonic saline works as an osmotic agent, drawing water into the airway surface liquid. This hydrates and thins the characteristically thick, tenacious mucus in cystic fibrosis, making it easier to clear. It is administered after the bronchodilator to maximize its distribution and minimize the risk of bronchospasm."

        {
            "option": "opt_5",
            "step": 3,
            "label": "Administer nebulized dornase alfa.",
            "rationale": "This is the correct third step. Dornase alfa is a mucolytic that works by cleaving extracellular DNA from neutrophils present in CF sputum, which significantly reduces mucus viscosity. It is most effective when administered after the airways have been opened by the bronchodilator and the mucus has been hydrated by the hypertonic saline."

            "option": "opt_4",
            "step": 4,
            "label": "Perform high-frequency chest wall oscillation (vest therapy).",
            "rationale": "This is the correct fourth step. After the medications have worked to open airways and thin mucus, a physical airway clearance technique is required. The vest therapy uses vibration to dislodge the now-loosened mucus from the walls of the smaller airways and move it into the larger, central airways where it can be coughed out."
        },
        {
            "option": "opt_2",
            "step": 5,
            "label": "Assist the client with huff coughing techniques.",
            "rationale": "This is the correct final step in the sequence. Huff coughing (forced expiratory technique) is a method used to clear the secretions that have been mobilized into the large airways by the vest therapy. It is more effective and less fatiguing than traditional coughing for clients with CF. This action directly removes the secretions from the body, completing the goal of the airway clearance therapy."
