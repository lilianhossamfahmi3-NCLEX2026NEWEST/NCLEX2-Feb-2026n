    "question": "A nurse in an acute mental health facility is admitting a 28-year-old client with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, current episode manic. The client is pacing in the hallway, talking loudly, and gesturing wildly to other clients. The client has not eaten or slept in 48 hours. The nurse needs to intervene. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions follows the principle of safety first, followed by the use of least restrictive interventions. The priority is to ensure the safety of the client and others by reducing environmental stimuli (moving to a quiet room). The next step is to attempt verbal de-escalation. Once the immediate environment is controlled, the nurse addresses urgent physiological needs (nutrition/hydration) with appropriate food choices for a hyperactive client. If these measures are insufficient to manage agitation, pharmacological intervention is necessary. Providing complex information like unit rules is the lowest priority as the client is not in a state to process it.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order would be incorrect because it would either fail to prioritize safety, utilize a more restrictive intervention (like medication) before a less restrictive one (like de-escalation), or attempt to provide education at a time when the client's cognitive state prevents comprehension.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the first priority. A client in an acute manic state is over-responsive to environmental stimuli. Moving them to a quiet area reduces external triggers, helps decrease agitation, and ensures the safety of the client and other patients on the milieu."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "After ensuring a safe, low-stimulus environment, the next step is to use therapeutic communication. A calm, firm, and non-judgmental approach is a key de-escalation technique that can help build trust and reduce the client's anxiety and agitation without resorting to more restrictive measures."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Addressing physiological needs is critical, as the client has not eaten in 48 hours and is at risk for dehydration and exhaustion. Finger foods are ideal because they are portable and do not require the client to sit still, which is difficult during a manic episode. This is addressed after immediate safety is managed."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Pharmacological intervention is warranted when non-pharmacological strategies (reducing stimuli, de-escalation) are insufficient to manage escalating agitation. Administering an antipsychotic like olanzapine helps stabilize mood and reduce hyperactivity, preventing further escalation and physical exhaustion."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the last priority. The client's current cognitive state, characterized by flight of ideas, poor concentration, and impaired judgment, makes it impossible for them to absorb, process, or retain structured information. This intervention is appropriate only after the client's acute mania has begun to stabilize."
