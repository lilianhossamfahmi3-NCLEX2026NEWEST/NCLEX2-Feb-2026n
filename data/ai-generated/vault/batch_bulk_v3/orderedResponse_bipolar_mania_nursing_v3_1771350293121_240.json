  "question": "A nurse in an acute mental health facility is admitting a 28-year-old client with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, current episode manic. The client is pacing in the hallway, talking loudly, and gesturing wildly to other clients. The client has not eaten or slept in 48 hours. The nurse needs to intervene. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety and utilizes the least restrictive interventions first. Moving the client to a quiet room reduces environmental stimuli. Attempting verbal de-escalation with a calm, firm tone can help build trust and reduce anxiety. Addressing physiological needs with high-calorie finger foods and fluids is crucial due to the client's lack of sleep and food intake. Pharmacological intervention with olanzapine is indicated if non-pharmacological measures are insufficient. Orienting the client to unit rules is the lowest priority due to their impaired cognitive state.",
    "incorrect": "Any other order would be incorrect because it would either fail to prioritize safety, utilize a more restrictive intervention (like medication) before a less restrictive one (like de-escalation), or attempt to provide education at a time when the client's cognitive state prevents comprehension.",

        "content": "Escort the client to a quiet, low-stimulus room.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Clients experiencing mania are highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, which can exacerbate agitation and escalate the manic episode. A quiet, low-stimulus environment minimizes external triggers, promoting a sense of calm and safety. This action aligns with the principle of 'least restrictive intervention' and prioritizes the client's immediate safety and well-being. **Clinical Pearl:** Dimming the lights and removing unnecessary objects from the room can further reduce stimulation.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Therapeutic communication is essential for de-escalation. A calm, firm, and non-judgmental approach can help build trust and reduce the client's anxiety and agitation. Maintaining a consistent and respectful demeanor can help the client feel understood and safe, facilitating cooperation. **Clinical Pearl:** Avoid arguing or engaging in power struggles with the client. Use simple, clear language and focus on the client's feelings.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Clients in a manic state often experience increased energy expenditure and neglect their basic needs, leading to dehydration and nutritional deficiencies. Providing high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and fluids helps replenish energy stores, prevent dehydration, and stabilize blood sugar levels. Finger foods are ideal because they are easy to consume and do not require the client to sit still. **Clinical Pearl:** Offer a variety of options to increase the likelihood of the client consuming something. Avoid caffeinated beverages, which can exacerbate agitation.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that helps to stabilize mood and reduce hyperactivity, agitation, and psychotic symptoms associated with mania. It works by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain, which helps to restore chemical balance and reduce the intensity of the manic episode. This intervention is warranted when non-pharmacological strategies are insufficient to manage escalating agitation and prevent harm to the client or others. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client for side effects such as sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** During an acute manic episode, the client's cognitive functioning is impaired, making it difficult for them to process and retain information. Attempting to orient the client to the unit's rules and daily schedule at this time would be ineffective and potentially frustrating for both the client and the nurse. This intervention is more appropriate once the client's acute symptoms have begun to subside and their cognitive functioning has improved. **Clinical Pearl:** Provide simple, concrete information in small increments as the client's condition stabilizes.",
