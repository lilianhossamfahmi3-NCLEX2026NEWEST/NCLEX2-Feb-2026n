    "condition": {
      "option": "Burn Shock",
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting signs of Burn Shock. SBAR: Situation: 45-year-old male, flash fire 2 hours ago, burns to anterior torso, right arm, and anterior right leg. Background: Estimated 36% TBSA burn (anterior torso 18% + entire right arm 9% + anterior right leg 9%). Assessment: Alert, oriented, severe pain, likely hypovolemic. Recommendation: Address Burn Shock immediately. Pathophysiology: Burns exceeding 20% TBSA trigger a massive systemic inflammatory response. This leads to increased capillary permeability and fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space (third spacing). The resulting hypovolemia decreases cardiac output and causes tissue hypoperfusion. Clinical Pearl: Burn Shock is a combination of distributive and hypovolemic shock. Rapid fluid resuscitation is critical to prevent irreversible organ damage.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "incorrectConditions": [
      {
        "option": "Neurogenic Shock",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Neurogenic shock is characterized by hypotension and bradycardia due to loss of sympathetic tone, typically from spinal cord injury. This client is tachycardic (compensatory response to hypovolemia) and has no neurological injury signs. SBAR does not support neurogenic shock. Pathophysiology: Neurogenic shock disrupts the autonomic nervous system, leading to vasodilation and decreased heart rate. Clinical Pearl: Neurogenic shock is often associated with spinal cord injuries above T6.",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "option": "Septic Shock",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Septic shock is a potential complication of major burns, developing later due to infection. The client's presentation, 2 hours post-injury, is due to acute inflammatory response and fluid shifts, not active infection. SBAR does not indicate infection. Pathophysiology: Septic shock results from a dysregulated immune response to infection, leading to widespread vasodilation and microvascular dysfunction. Clinical Pearl: Septic shock is characterized by hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and often requires vasopressors.",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "option": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. ARDS is a potential complication of major burns, often due to inhalation injury or systemic inflammatory response. However, it is not the primary condition immediately post-burn. The immediate life-threatening problem is circulatory collapse from burn shock. SBAR does not indicate respiratory distress. Pathophysiology: ARDS involves diffuse alveolar damage and increased pulmonary capillary permeability, leading to pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. Clinical Pearl: ARDS often requires mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "option": "Compartment Syndrome",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client with circumferential burns (entire arm involved) is at risk for compartment syndrome, the systemic signs of hypotension and tachycardia point to a systemic shock state, which is the most immediate and life-threatening priority. SBAR prioritizes systemic stabilization. Pathophysiology: Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure within a muscle compartment increases, compromising blood flow and leading to tissue ischemia. Clinical Pearl: The 6 Ps of compartment syndrome are pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness, and poikilothermia.",

    "actions": [
      {
        "option": "Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation with Lactated Ringer's solution.",
        "rationale": "Correct. This is the highest priority intervention. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is essential to restore intravascular volume, maintain cardiac output, and ensure vital organ perfusion. Lactated Ringer's is the isotonic crystalloid of choice as its electrolyte composition most closely resembles plasma, which helps to correct the associated metabolic acidosis. Pathophysiology: Fluid resuscitation combats the massive fluid shifts caused by increased capillary permeability in burn shock. The Parkland formula (4 mL/kg x %TBSA) guides initial fluid administration. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema, during resuscitation.",
        "correct": true
      },
      {
        "option": "Insert an indwelling urinary catheter.",
        "rationale": "Correct. For major burns requiring fluid resuscitation, an indwelling catheter is essential for precise, hourly monitoring of urine output. Urine output is the most sensitive non-invasive indicator of end-organ perfusion and the adequacy of fluid replacement therapy. Pathophysiology: Adequate urine output indicates sufficient renal perfusion, reflecting overall circulatory volume and cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Aim for a urine output of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr in adults with burns.",
        "correct": true

    "incorrectActions": [
      {
        "option": "Administer prophylactic intravenous antibiotics.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics are not recommended for fresh burns. This practice does not reduce the incidence of burn wound sepsis and can promote the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Antibiotics are reserved for treating documented infections. Pathophysiology: Overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics should be targeted at specific infections based on culture results. Clinical Pearl: Early wound care and infection control measures are more effective than prophylactic antibiotics in preventing burn wound sepsis.",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "option": "Apply topical silver sulfadiazine to all burn areas.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Wound care is a secondary priority after systemic stabilization (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The immediate life threat is burn shock, which must be addressed with fluid resuscitation first. Topical antimicrobials are applied after the client is stabilized. Pathophysiology: Topical antimicrobials help prevent infection in burn wounds by inhibiting bacterial growth. Clinical Pearl: Silver sulfadiazine can cause transient neutropenia and should be used with caution in clients with sulfa allergies.",

      },
      {
        "option": "Administer furosemide 40 mg IV push.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. This is contraindicated and dangerous. The client is severely hypovolemic due to third-spacing. Administering a diuretic would cause further fluid loss, worsen hypotension, and accelerate the progression to irreversible shock and renal failure. Pathophysiology: Diuretics decrease intravascular volume, exacerbating hypovolemia and reducing cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Diuretics are generally avoided in the initial management of burn shock.",

      {
        "option": "Urine output",
        "rationale": "Correct. Hourly urine output is the gold standard for monitoring the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. A target of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr (in this client, 45-90 mL/hr) indicates adequate renal and vital organ perfusion. Pathophysiology: Urine output reflects renal perfusion, which is directly related to intravascular volume and cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Monitor urine output closely and adjust fluid resuscitation rates accordingly.",
        "correct": true
      },
      {
        "option": "Mean arterial pressure (MAP)",
        "rationale": "Correct. MAP is a critical parameter for assessing organ perfusion. A target MAP of >65 mmHg is typically desired. It provides a more accurate picture of perfusion pressure than systolic blood pressure alone and is a key indicator of the response to fluid therapy. Pathophysiology: MAP reflects the average arterial pressure throughout the cardiac cycle and is a key determinant of organ perfusion. Clinical Pearl: Maintain a MAP >65 mmHg to ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs.",

    "incorrectParameters": [
      {
        "option": "Serum potassium level",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While electrolyte monitoring is important (hyperkalemia can occur initially from cell lysis), it is not the primary parameter used to titrate fluid resuscitation rates. The direct goals of resuscitation are to restore volume and perfusion, which are best measured by urine output and MAP. Pathophysiology: Hyperkalemia can result from cell damage and potassium release into the bloodstream. Clinical Pearl: Monitor potassium levels and treat hyperkalemia as needed, but prioritize fluid resuscitation based on urine output and MAP.",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "option": "Core body temperature",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Burn patients are at high risk for hypothermia due to loss of the skin barrier. While monitoring and maintaining temperature is a vital nursing intervention, it does not directly measure the adequacy of intravascular volume replacement. Pathophysiology: Loss of skin integrity impairs thermoregulation, leading to heat loss and hypothermia. Clinical Pearl: Use warming blankets and maintain a warm environment to prevent hypothermia.",
        "correct": false

      {
        "option": "Pain rating score",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Pain management is a crucial aspect of burn care. However, the pain score reflects the client's subjective experience of pain and the effectiveness of analgesia, not the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation in correcting the underlying shock state. Pathophysiology: Burn injuries cause significant pain due to nerve damage and inflammation. Clinical Pearl: Provide adequate pain relief with opioid analgesics, but prioritize fluid resuscitation to address the underlying shock state.",
