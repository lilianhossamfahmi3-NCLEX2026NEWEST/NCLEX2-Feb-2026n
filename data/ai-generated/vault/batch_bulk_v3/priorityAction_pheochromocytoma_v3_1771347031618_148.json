Which actions should the nurse prioritize?",

        "correct": "The priority actions focus on immediately reducing blood pressure and preventing further catecholamine release. Administering IV phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, is the primary pharmacological intervention to directly counteract the intense vasoconstriction caused by excess norepinephrine and epinephrine, thereby lowering blood pressure. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is a crucial non-pharmacological intervention that uses gravity to decrease venous return to the heart, reducing preload and cardiac workload, which helps lower blood pressure. Minimizing environmental stimuli is essential because stress, noise, and bright lights can trigger further catecholamine surges from the tumor, exacerbating the hypertensive crisis.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker like propranolol before establishing alpha-blockade is contraindicated and dangerous. It can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing paradoxical hypertension and potentially fatal vasoconstriction. Palpating the abdomen is strictly avoided as it can physically manipulate the adrenal tumor, provoking a massive release of catecholamines and worsening the crisis. While diagnostic imaging like an MIBG scan will be needed, it is not the immediate priority during an acute crisis; stabilization must occur first.",
