  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority actions in a pheochromocytoma crisis (sudden catecholamine surge from an adrenal tumor) are to rapidly reduce blood pressure and prevent further catecholamine release. \n\n**Phentolamine (alpha-blocker):**  This is the *most* critical intervention. Phentolamine directly blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors, counteracting the vasoconstriction caused by excess norepinephrine and epinephrine. This leads to vasodilation and a rapid decrease in blood pressure.  Without alpha-blockade, administering a beta-blocker can be disastrous.\n\n**High-Fowler's Position:** This non-pharmacological intervention uses gravity to decrease venous return (preload) to the heart.  Reduced preload decreases cardiac workload and helps lower blood pressure.  It's a simple, effective way to support hemodynamic stability.\n\n**Minimize Stimuli:**  Stress, noise, and bright lights can trigger further catecholamine release from the tumor, exacerbating the hypertensive crisis. A calm, quiet, and dimly lit environment helps prevent further stimulation of the adrenal gland.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:**  Pheochromocytoma crises are rare but life-threatening.  Rapid recognition and intervention are crucial.  Remember the *priority* is to block the effects of excess catecholamines.",
    "incorrect": "\n**Propranolol (beta-blocker):** Administering a beta-blocker *before* establishing adequate alpha-blockade is *contraindicated* and extremely dangerous.  Beta-blockade alone can lead to *unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation*, causing paradoxical hypertension and potentially fatal vasoconstriction.  This occurs because beta-2 receptors, which cause vasodilation, are blocked, leaving only alpha-1 receptors (which cause vasoconstriction) active.\n\n**Abdominal Palpation:**  Palpating the abdomen is strictly avoided.  Physical manipulation of the adrenal tumor can provoke a massive release of catecholamines, worsening the crisis.  This could lead to stroke, myocardial infarction, or death.\n\n**MIBG Scan:** While diagnostic imaging like an MIBG scan (metaiodobenzylguanidine) is used to locate the tumor *eventually*, it is *not* the immediate priority during an acute crisis. The client must be hemodynamically stabilized *first*.  Moving an unstable client for imaging is unsafe and delays life-saving interventions.\n\n**Pathophysiology Deep Dive:** Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These hormones bind to alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors throughout the body, causing widespread vasoconstriction (alpha-1), increased heart rate and contractility (beta-1), and bronchodilation (beta-2). The sudden surge of catecholamines in a crisis leads to a dramatic increase in blood pressure, potentially causing end-organ damage (e.g., stroke, heart failure, kidney failure).",
