  "stem": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the progressive care unit at 1400 with a new diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following a recent viral illness. The nurse's assessment reveals ascending paralysis affecting the lower extremities and trunk. The client is alert and oriented but reports increasing difficulty taking a deep breath. Vital signs are: Temperature 99.1°F (37.3°C), heart rate 112 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, blood pressure 148/92 mmHg, and SpO2 94% on room air. The nurse notes diminished breath sounds at the lung bases and observes the client is unable to lift their head off the pillow.",

  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority intervention for a client with GBS exhibiting signs of respiratory compromise is to monitor respiratory function closely. Measuring vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) every 4 hours is crucial. GBS is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves, leading to inflammation and demyelination. This ascending paralysis can affect the respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostals), leading to hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and potential need for mechanical ventilation. The client's report of difficulty breathing, tachypnea (RR 24), SpO2 of 94%, and inability to lift their head (indicating neck flexor weakness, often preceding diaphragmatic involvement) are all critical indicators of impending respiratory failure. VC measures the maximum amount of air a person can exhale after a maximum inhalation, reflecting lung volume and respiratory muscle strength. NIF measures the strength of the inspiratory muscles. A declining VC and NIF indicate worsening respiratory muscle weakness and the need for immediate intervention, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation. ClinicalPearl: Early and frequent monitoring of respiratory parameters is paramount in GBS to prevent respiratory arrest.",
    "incorrect": "While the other options are appropriate interventions for a client with GBS, they are not the immediate priority. Preventing aspiration (swallow screen), deep vein thrombosis (pneumatic compression devices), and managing autonomic dysfunction (cardiac monitoring) are all important, but they do not address the most acute, life-threatening risk of respiratory arrest. The ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework dictates that maintaining a patent airway and adequate breathing is the primary concern.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "This is incorrect. While bulbar muscle weakness can cause dysphagia and risk for aspiration in GBS, the immediate life threat is respiratory failure. The client's respiratory cues (tachypnea, borderline SpO2, subjective dyspnea) take precedence over a swallow screen according to the ABCs of prioritization.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "This is incorrect. Due to immobility from paralysis, clients with GBS are at high risk for DVT. Applying pneumatic compression devices is an essential prophylactic measure but does not address the acute, life-threatening priority of impending respiratory failure.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "This is correct. The most significant and immediate threat in GBS is respiratory failure due to ascending paralysis affecting the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. The client's tachypnea, borderline SpO2, and inability to lift the head are ominous signs. Frequent, objective measurement of respiratory muscle strength with vital capacity and NIF is the priority intervention to detect deterioration and allow for timely intervention.",
        "isCorrect": true

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "This is incorrect. Autonomic dysfunction (causing tachycardia, bradycardia, and labile blood pressure) is common in GBS, making cardiac monitoring important. However, the presented clinical signs point more urgently to a breathing problem, which is a more immediate threat to life than the current cardiovascular status (HR 112, BP 148/92).",
