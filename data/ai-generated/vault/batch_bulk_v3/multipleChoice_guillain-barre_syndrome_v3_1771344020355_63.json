    "stem": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the progressive care unit with a new diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following a recent viral illness. The nurse's assessment reveals ascending paralysis affecting the lower extremities and trunk. The client is alert and oriented but reports increasing difficulty taking a deep breath. Vital signs are: Temperature 99.1°F (37.3°C), heart rate 112 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, blood pressure 148/92 mmHg, and SpO2 94% on room air. The nurse notes diminished breath sounds at the lung bases and observes the client is unable to lift their head off the pillow.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The highest priority for a client with GBS is monitoring for and preventing respiratory failure. The ascending paralysis in GBS can affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to a rapid decline in respiratory function. The client's subjective report of difficulty breathing, tachypnea (24 breaths/min), borderline SpO2 (94%), and inability to lift their head (a sign of neck flexor weakness, which often precedes diaphragmatic paralysis) are all critical cues indicating impending respiratory compromise. Measuring vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) provides objective data about the strength of respiratory muscles and is the most sensitive way to detect early respiratory failure before significant changes in SpO2 or arterial blood gases occur. This proactive monitoring allows for timely intervention, such as intubation.",
        "incorrect": "While the other options are appropriate interventions for a client with GBS, they are not the immediate priority. Preventing aspiration (swallow screen), deep vein thrombosis (pneumatic compression devices), and managing autonomic dysfunction (cardiac monitoring) are all important, but they do not address the most acute, life-threatening risk of respiratory arrest. The ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework dictates that maintaining a patent airway and adequate breathing is the primary concern.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. While bulbar muscle weakness can cause dysphagia and risk for aspiration in GBS, the immediate life threat is respiratory failure. The client's respiratory cues (tachypnea, borderline SpO2, subjective dyspnea) take precedence over a swallow screen according to the ABCs of prioritization.",

The client's tachypnea, borderline SpO2, and inability to lift the head are ominous signs.
