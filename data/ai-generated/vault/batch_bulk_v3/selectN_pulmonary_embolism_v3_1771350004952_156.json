  "answerBreakdown": {
    "opt_1": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The patient's SpO2 of 86% indicates severe hypoxemia, a critical finding in massive PE. A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-95% FiO2). This is essential to increase oxygen delivery to the tissues, reduce the work of breathing, and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. In PE, impaired gas exchange occurs due to the blockage of pulmonary arteries, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Clinical Pearl: Rapid oxygenation is paramount in PE to prevent further complications like cardiac arrest.",
      "pathophysiology": "Massive PE obstructs a significant portion of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular strain. This impairs gas exchange, causing hypoxemia and increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. The body attempts to compensate by increasing respiratory rate, but this is often insufficient to maintain adequate oxygen saturation."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Placing the patient in a high-Fowler's position (60-90 degrees) maximizes lung expansion by allowing the diaphragm to descend more fully. This position optimizes ventilation, reduces the work of breathing, and can help alleviate the patient's sensation of dyspnea and anxiety. It also promotes venous return to the heart, which can be compromised in PE due to increased pulmonary pressure. Clinical Pearl: Positioning is a simple yet effective intervention to improve respiratory function.",
      "pathophysiology": "High-Fowler's position decreases the pressure on the diaphragm from abdominal contents, allowing for greater lung expansion. This improves tidal volume and reduces the effort required for each breath. In PE, this can help to improve oxygenation and reduce the sensation of breathlessness."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that inhibits the synthesis of clotting factors. It has a slow onset of action (typically 3-5 days) and requires bridging with a faster-acting anticoagulant like heparin or enoxaparin. It is inappropriate for the acute management of a massive PE where immediate anticoagulation is required. Clinical Pearl: Warfarin is for long-term anticoagulation, not for acute emergencies.",
      "pathophysiology": "Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S. This process takes several days to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation, making it unsuitable for acute PE management."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. A massive PE causes obstructive shock, leading to hemodynamic instability (BP 98/60 mmHg). Establishing a second large-bore IV line (18 gauge or larger) is a crucial immediate action to ensure reliable access for administering fluids, vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine), and emergency medications like thrombolytics (alteplase). Rapid fluid resuscitation may be needed to support blood pressure, but should be done cautiously to avoid right ventricular overload. Clinical Pearl: Multiple IV access points are vital in critical situations for rapid medication and fluid administration.",
      "pathophysiology": "Massive PE obstructs blood flow to the left ventricle, reducing cardiac output and causing hypotension. The body's compensatory mechanisms, such as increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, may be insufficient to maintain adequate blood pressure. Additional IV access allows for rapid administration of fluids and medications to support hemodynamic stability."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Incentive spirometry is used for lung expansion to prevent atelectasis, typically in post-operative patients. For a patient in acute, severe respiratory distress with pleuritic chest pain, this intervention is contraindicated as it would increase pain, oxygen demand, and anxiety. The priority is to address the underlying PE and provide respiratory support. Clinical Pearl: Incentive spirometry is not appropriate for patients in acute respiratory distress.",
      "pathophysiology": "Incentive spirometry requires the patient to take deep breaths, which can exacerbate pleuritic chest pain and increase oxygen consumption. In PE, the lungs are already compromised, and forcing deep breaths can worsen ventilation-perfusion mismatch and increase the risk of further complications."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. A massive PE is characterized by hemodynamic instability (hypotension). The definitive treatment is often thrombolysis with a medication like alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) to dissolve the clot and restore pulmonary blood flow. The nurse must anticipate this order and prepare for its administration immediately to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death. Contraindications to thrombolysis must be assessed rapidly. Clinical Pearl: Thrombolytic therapy is a life-saving intervention in massive PE, but requires careful patient selection and monitoring.",
      "pathophysiology": "Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that converts plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. By dissolving the pulmonary embolus, alteplase restores pulmonary blood flow, reduces pulmonary artery pressure, and improves right ventricular function. This can reverse the hemodynamic instability associated with massive PE."
