        "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate interventions to improve oxygenation and reduce cardiac workload before proceeding with medication administration and diagnostics. The first action is positioning the client to leverage gravity, which is the quickest way to ease the work of breathing. This is followed by applying BiPAP to address the severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Establishing IV access is the necessary next step to allow for medication administration. IV furosemide is then given to promote rapid diuresis and reduce fluid volume overload. Sublingual nitroglycerin further reduces preload and afterload. Finally, obtaining an ECG is performed once life-sustaining measures are initiated to investigate for a potential ischemic trigger.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering would jeopardize the client's safety. For instance, attempting to administer IV medication before establishing IV access is illogical. Delaying positioning and BiPAP application would lead to worsening respiratory failure and potential need for intubation. Prioritizing the ECG over immediate respiratory support ignores the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of emergency care, as the client's primary problem is severe gas exchange impairment from pulmonary edema.",
