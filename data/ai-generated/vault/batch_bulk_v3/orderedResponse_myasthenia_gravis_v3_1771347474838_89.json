    "questionText": "A 68-year-old client with a history of myasthenia gravis presents to the emergency department with progressive dysphagia, diplopia, and generalized weakness despite taking their prescribed pyridostigmine. The healthcare provider suspects a myasthenic crisis versus a cholinergic crisis and orders an edrophonium (Tensilon) test. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions to safely prepare for and assist with the test? Arrange the actions from first to last.",

        "opt_3": "The first and most critical action is ensuring safety. Edrophonium, a cholinesterase inhibitor, can induce a cholinergic crisis, leading to severe bradycardia, bronchospasm, and increased secretions. Atropine is the antidote and must be readily available to reverse these life-threatening effects. A crash cart is essential for managing potential respiratory arrest or cardiovascular collapse.",
        "opt_5": "The second action is to establish patent IV access. Edrophonium is administered intravenously for its rapid onset of action. Securing a reliable IV line is a prerequisite for administering the medication safely and effectively.",
        "opt_2": "The third action is to establish a clear baseline of the client's neuromuscular function. The purpose of the test is to compare muscle strength before and after the medication. Objectively assessing and documenting specific parameters like the degree of ptosis, facial muscle movement, or grip strength is crucial for accurately interpreting the test results.",
        "opt_1": "The fourth action is to administer the initial small test dose. This is done to assess for client hypersensitivity or a paradoxical, adverse cholinergic reaction before the full diagnostic dose is given. This step minimizes the risk of a severe adverse event.",
        "opt_4": "The fifth action is to immediately observe the client's response. Edrophonium acts very quickly (within 30-60 seconds). The nurse must closely monitor for either a temporary improvement in muscle strength (a positive test, indicating a myasthenic crisis) or a worsening of weakness/fasciculations (a negative test, indicating a cholinergic crisis).",
        "opt_6": "The final action in the sequence is to administer the remainder of the prescribed dose. If the client tolerates the initial test dose without any adverse effects, the remaining medication is given to elicit a definitive diagnostic response, confirming the diagnosis of either a myasthenic or cholinergic crisis."
