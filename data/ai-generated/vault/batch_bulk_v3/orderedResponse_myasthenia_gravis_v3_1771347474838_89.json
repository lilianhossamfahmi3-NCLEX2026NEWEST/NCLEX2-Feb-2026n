  "questionText": "A 68-year-old client with a history of myasthenia gravis presents to the emergency department with progressive dysphagia, diplopia, and generalized weakness despite taking their prescribed pyridostigmine. The healthcare provider suspects a myasthenic crisis versus a cholinergic crisis and orders an edrophonium (Tensilon) test. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions to safely prepare for and assist with the test? Arrange the actions from first to last.",

    "opt_3": "**Correct Placement:** The priority is client safety. Edrophonium is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels. In susceptible individuals, this can precipitate a cholinergic crisis characterized by bradycardia, bronchospasm, and increased secretions. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and the antidote for cholinergic crisis, reversing these effects. A crash cart is essential for immediate management of potential respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. **Pathophysiology:** Myasthenia gravis involves the destruction of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Edrophonium temporarily inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing available acetylcholine. However, excessive acetylcholine can lead to overstimulation of muscarinic receptors. **Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Atropine should be readily available and easily accessible.",
    "opt_5": "**Correct Placement:** Establishing IV access is crucial for rapid medication administration and emergency interventions. Edrophonium has a short half-life, and its effects are quickly observed. A large-bore IV allows for rapid infusion of fluids or medications if needed. **Pathophysiology:** Intravenous administration ensures rapid and predictable drug absorption, bypassing the variability of oral or intramuscular routes. **Clinical Pearl:** Choose a large peripheral vein to accommodate rapid fluid or medication administration if needed. Document the gauge and location of the IV catheter.",
    "opt_2": "**Correct Placement:** A thorough baseline assessment is essential for accurate interpretation of the edrophonium test. Documenting the degree of ptosis, facial muscle strength, grip strength, and any other relevant neurological deficits provides a reference point for comparison after edrophonium administration. **Pathophysiology:** Myasthenia gravis causes fluctuating muscle weakness. The edrophonium test aims to temporarily improve muscle strength in a myasthenic crisis. A precise baseline is needed to detect subtle changes. **Clinical Pearl:** Use a standardized muscle strength scale (e.g., the Medical Research Council scale) for objective documentation. Include photographs or videos to document ptosis if possible.",
    "opt_1": "**Correct Placement:** Administering a small test dose allows the nurse to assess the client's response to edrophonium and minimize the risk of adverse effects. A 2 mg test dose is typically used to evaluate for hypersensitivity or paradoxical reactions. **Pathophysiology:** A small test dose helps determine the client's sensitivity to the medication and reduces the risk of a severe cholinergic crisis. **Clinical Pearl:** Have atropine drawn up and ready to administer before giving the edrophonium test dose. Monitor the client closely for any signs of cholinergic excess (e.g., bradycardia, increased salivation, muscle fasciculations).",
    "opt_4": "**Correct Placement:** Edrophonium has a rapid onset of action (typically within 30-60 seconds). Close observation is critical to detect any changes in muscle strength or adverse effects. Improvement in muscle strength suggests a myasthenic crisis, while worsening weakness suggests a cholinergic crisis. **Pathophysiology:** Edrophonium's effect is short-lived, requiring immediate and continuous monitoring to assess the client's response. **Clinical Pearl:** Have a second nurse present to assist with monitoring and documentation. Use a timer to accurately track the onset and duration of effects.",
    "opt_6": "**Correct Placement:** If the client tolerates the initial test dose without adverse effects, the remaining dose is administered to elicit a more definitive diagnostic response. This helps confirm the diagnosis of either myasthenic or cholinergic crisis. **Pathophysiology:** The full dose of edrophonium provides a more pronounced effect, allowing for a clearer differentiation between myasthenic and cholinergic crises. **Clinical Pearl:** Continue to monitor the client closely for at least 5-10 minutes after administering the remaining dose. Document the client's response in detail, including any changes in muscle strength, vital signs, or adverse effects."
