The trend data for Day 4 shows a decrease in creatinine from a peak of 4.5 mg/dL to 3.2 mg/dL, a decrease in potassium from a peak of 6.2 mEq/L to 5.1 mEq/L, and a significant increase in urine output to 1800 mL. These three findings collectively signal that the client is entering the diuretic (recovery) phase of AKI.",
        "incorrect": "While a stable blood pressure is crucial for renal perfusion, it is not a direct measure of renal recovery itself, especially since it was previously supported by vasopressors. A low urine specific gravity is common in the diuretic phase of AKI recovery as the renal tubules have not yet regained concentrating ability, so it doesn't represent functional improvement. The persistence of any edema indicates continued fluid retention, which is contrary to the idea of full renal recovery.",
