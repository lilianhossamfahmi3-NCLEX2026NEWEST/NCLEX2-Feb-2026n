The client is confused, reporting a severe headache and blurred vision. Vital signs are: BP 228/132 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 26/min. The provider orders a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Which nursing actions are appropriate in the management of this client? (Select all that apply.)",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "In a hypertensive emergency, the goal is a controlled reduction of blood pressure to prevent further end-organ damage while avoiding iatrogenic ischemia. This requires precise medication delivery via an infusion pump, continuous monitoring of cardiac and neurological status, and adherence to established titration parameters (lowering MAP by 10-20% in the first hour, then gradually by another 5-15% over the next 23 hours). These actions ensure patient safety during the administration of potent intravenous vasodilators like sodium nitroprusside.",
        "incorrect": "Actions that cause rapid, uncontrolled drops in blood pressure or increase intracranial pressure are contraindicated and dangerous. A rapid decrease in blood pressure can lead to cerebral, myocardial, or renal ischemia. The Trendelenburg position would worsen cerebral edema and increase intracranial pressure, exacerbating the client's neurological symptoms.",
