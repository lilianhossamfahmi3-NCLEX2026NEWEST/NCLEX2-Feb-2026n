  "stem": "A 68-year-old client with a history of chronic kidney disease is admitted to the intensive care unit at 14:00 with a hypertensive emergency. The client is confused, reporting a severe headache and blurred vision. Vital signs are: BP 228/132 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 26/min. The provider orders a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Which nursing actions are appropriate in the management of this client? (Select all that apply.)",

    "correct": "In a hypertensive emergency, rapid and uncontrolled hypertension can lead to end-organ damage (brain, heart, kidneys). Sodium nitroprusside, a potent vasodilator, requires careful administration. Using a volumetric infusion pump (B) ensures precise medication delivery, preventing drastic blood pressure drops. Frequent neurological assessments (C) are crucial to monitor for changes in mental status, seizures, or focal deficits, indicating worsening or improving cerebral perfusion. Titrating the infusion to lower MAP by no more than 25% in the first hour (D) prevents cerebral hypoperfusion. Continuous cardiac monitoring (F) is essential to detect arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia secondary to rapid blood pressure changes or underlying cardiac disease. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Hypertensive emergencies cause endothelial damage, leading to platelet activation and fibrin deposition in arterioles. This results in ischemia and further end-organ damage. Rapidly lowering blood pressure can exacerbate ischemia if autoregulation is impaired.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Sodium nitroprusside is light-sensitive and should be protected from light with an opaque cover. Monitor for cyanide toxicity, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.",
    "incorrect": "Placing the client in Trendelenburg position (A) increases intracranial pressure (ICP), which is contraindicated in hypertensive encephalopathy. Rapidly decreasing blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg within 30 minutes (E) can cause cerebral, myocardial, or renal ischemia due to the body's adaptation to chronically high pressures. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** The brain's autoregulatory mechanisms adapt to chronic hypertension, shifting the lower limit of autoregulation to higher pressures. Rapidly lowering blood pressure below this limit can cause hypoperfusion and ischemia.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** The goal in a hypertensive emergency is controlled reduction, not normalization, of blood pressure. Aim for a 10-20% reduction in MAP in the first hour, followed by a gradual reduction over the next 23 hours.",
