This is likely due to the combination of sertraline (an SSRI), sumatriptan (a triptan), and dextromethorphan (a common ingredient in OTC cough medicine), all of which increase serotonin levels. The trend data across all physiological systems indicates a significant and dangerous decline, requiring immediate medical intervention.",

This is evidenced by the progressive increase in heart rate from 110 to 140 beats/min (tachycardia) and blood pressure from 155/90 to 180/105 mmHg (hypertension). These findings reflect autonomic instability, a hallmark of moderate to severe serotonin syndrome."

This progressive hyperthermia is a critical and life-threatening feature of serotonin syndrome, driven by increased muscle activity and central nervous system dysregulation."

Furthermore, neuromuscular hyperactivity has progressed from hyperreflexia to sustained and then spontaneous clonus, accompanied by the development of muscle rigidity. This represents a severe decline in neurological function characteristic of serotonin toxicity."

The respiratory rate has increased from 22 to 28 breaths/min (tachypnea), and oxygen saturation has decreased from 97% to 94%. This indicates increasing metabolic demand and potential for respiratory compromise, which can be exacerbated by the developing muscle rigidity affecting the chest wall."
