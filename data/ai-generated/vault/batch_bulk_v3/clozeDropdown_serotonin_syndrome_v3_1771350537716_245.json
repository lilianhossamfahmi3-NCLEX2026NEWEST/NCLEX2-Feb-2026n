His home medications include sertraline 100 mg daily. On day 2 of admission, he is receiving IV levofloxacin and was given tramadol 50 mg PO for joint pain 1 hour ago. The nurse is called to the bedside for a sudden change in condition.\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n- Temperature: 39.1° C (102.4° F)\n- Heart Rate: 132 bpm\n- Blood Pressure: 178/96 mmHg\n- Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths/min\n- SpO2: 94% on room air\n- Neurological: Agitated, confused, pupils dilated. Spontaneous clonus noted in the left ankle. Hyperreflexia +3 in all extremities. Profuse diaphoresis.\n\nThe nurse should complete the following sentence for the plan of care.\n\nThe nurse recognizes the client's cluster of findings is most likely caused by {{1}}. The nurse's first action should be to recommend {{2}}. To manage the client's severe agitation and clonus, the nurse should anticipate an order for {{3}}, which directly addresses the {{4}}.",

This was precipitated by the administration of tramadol, which has serotonergic properties, to a client already taking sertraline (an SSRI). The primary intervention is to remove the offending agents. First-line symptomatic treatment involves administering a benzodiazepine, like lorazepam, to control agitation and muscle hyperactivity (clonus, rigidity).",

Interventions for other conditions, such as antipyretics for fever or dantrolene for NMS, would be ineffective or inappropriate. While supportive care like seizure precautions is important, it does not take precedence over removing the causative agents.",
