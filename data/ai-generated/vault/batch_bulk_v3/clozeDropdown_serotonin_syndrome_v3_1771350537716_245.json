His home medications include sertraline 100 mg daily. On day 2 of admission, he is receiving IV levofloxacin and was given tramadol 50 mg PO for joint pain 1 hour ago. The nurse is called to the bedside for a sudden change in condition.\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n- Temperature: 39.1° C (102.4° F)\n- Heart Rate: 132 bpm\n- Blood Pressure: 178/96 mmHg\n- Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths/min\n- SpO2: 94% on room air\n- Neurological: Agitated, confused, pupils dilated. Spontaneous clonus noted in the left ankle. Hyperreflexia +3 in all extremities. Profuse diaphoresis.\n\nThe nurse should complete the following sentence for the plan of care.\n\nThe nurse recognizes the client's cluster of findings is most likely caused by {{1}}. The nurse's first action should be to recommend {{2}}. To manage the client's severe agitation and clonus, the nurse should anticipate an order for {{3}}, which directly addresses the {{4}}.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic triad of serotonin syndrome (SS): altered mental status (agitation, confusion), autonomic instability (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (clonus, hyperreflexia). This was precipitated by the administration of tramadol, which has serotonergic properties, to a client already taking sertraline (an SSRI). Sertraline inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. Tramadol also inhibits serotonin reuptake and acts as a serotonin releasing agent, further increasing serotonin levels. The overstimulation of serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT2A receptors, leads to the observed symptoms. The primary intervention is to remove the offending agents to halt the excessive serotonergic activity. First-line symptomatic treatment involves administering a benzodiazepine, like lorazepam, to control agitation and muscle hyperactivity (clonus, rigidity). Lorazepam enhances the effect of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which helps to reduce neuronal excitability and muscle spasms.",
    "incorrect": "Other conditions may present with some similar symptoms, but the complete clinical picture, especially the combination of a known drug interaction with clonus and hyperreflexia, points specifically to serotonin syndrome. Interventions for other conditions, such as antipyretics for fever or dantrolene for NMS, would be ineffective or inappropriate. While supportive care like seizure precautions is important, it does not take precedence over removing the causative agents. Sepsis, NMS, and levofloxacin reactions do not typically present with the specific neuromuscular findings of clonus and hyperreflexia.",

This combination significantly increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, and the client's symptoms (altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular hyperactivity like clonus) are classic for this diagnosis. The combined serotonergic effects overwhelm the serotonin receptors in the brain and spinal cord.",

Furthermore, NMS typically presents with diffuse 'lead-pipe' rigidity and bradyreflexia, in contrast to the clonus and hyperreflexia seen in this client.
