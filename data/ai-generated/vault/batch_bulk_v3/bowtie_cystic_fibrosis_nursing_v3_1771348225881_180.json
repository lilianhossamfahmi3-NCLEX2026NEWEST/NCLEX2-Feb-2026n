    "prompt": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 22-year-old client with a known history of cystic fibrosis. The client reports increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, and a productive cough with thick, yellow-green sputum over the past 3 days. The client states, \"My chest feels so tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath.\" The nurse notes the client appears fatigued and has lost 4 lbs (1.8 kg) in the last week. Review the client's assessment findings and select the appropriate potential condition, two actions the nurse should take, and two parameters the nurse should monitor.",

The priority nursing actions are to identify the causative organism to guide antibiotic therapy (sputum culture) and to improve airway clearance (HFCWO). Subsequently, the nurse must monitor the client's response to these interventions by assessing their work of breathing (for signs of improvement like decreased accessory muscle use) and changes in sputum characteristics (color, viscosity, and amount), which are key indicators of treatment effectiveness.",

Administering pancreatic enzymes is part of routine care, not an immediate intervention for respiratory distress. Furosemide is contraindicated as it can worsen dehydration and thicken secretions. Monitoring blood glucose is important but secondary to the immediate respiratory crisis. Monitoring abdominal girth or urine specific gravity does not directly address the primary pulmonary problem.",
