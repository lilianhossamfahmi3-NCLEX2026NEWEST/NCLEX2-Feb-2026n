  "prompt": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 22-year-old client with a known history of cystic fibrosis. The client reports increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, and a productive cough with thick, yellow-green sputum over the past 3 days. The client states, \"My chest feels so tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath.\" The nurse notes the client appears fatigued and has lost 1.8 kg (4 lbs) in the last week. Review the client's assessment findings and select the appropriate potential condition, two actions the nurse should take, and two parameters the nurse should monitor.",

    "correct": "The client's presentation (fever, increased productive cough with purulent sputum, weight loss, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia) strongly indicates a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, an acute worsening of chronic lung infection and inflammation. Sputum culture identifies the causative organism for targeted antibiotic therapy. HFCWO improves airway clearance by mobilizing thick mucus. Monitoring work of breathing (WOB) assesses response to interventions; decreased accessory muscle use indicates improvement. Sputum characteristics (color, viscosity, amount) reflect treatment effectiveness. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** CFTR gene mutation leads to defective chloride transport, causing thick, sticky mucus in lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mucus obstructs airways, promoting bacterial growth and chronic infection. Exacerbations involve increased inflammation and mucus production, leading to airway obstruction, impaired gas exchange, and respiratory distress. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early identification and aggressive treatment of pulmonary exacerbations are crucial to prevent irreversible lung damage and improve long-term outcomes in clients with CF.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections indicate a misunderstanding of priorities in CF exacerbation. DIOS is a GI issue. Pancreatic enzymes are routine, not for acute distress. Furosemide worsens dehydration and thickens secretions. Blood glucose is secondary to respiratory crisis. Abdominal girth/urine specific gravity don't address the pulmonary problem.\n\n**Pathophysiology (Incorrect Options):**\n*   *Pneumothorax:* Air leaks into pleural space, collapsing the lung. Presents with sudden chest pain and diminished breath sounds.\n*   *DIOS:* Thickened intestinal contents cause obstruction. Presents with abdominal pain and distention.\n*   *Cor Pulmonale:* Right ventricular hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension. A chronic complication.\n*   *ABPA:* Allergic reaction to Aspergillus. Causes wheezing and mucus plugging, but less likely with fever and purulent sputum.",
