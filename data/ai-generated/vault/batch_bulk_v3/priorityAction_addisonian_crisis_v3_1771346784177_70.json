            "opt_1": "Rationale: Initiating a rapid fluid bolus of an isotonic solution like 0.9% sodium chloride is a critical intervention to address the client's profound hypovolemia and hypotension (BP 82/46 mmHg). However, the underlying cause of the circulatory collapse in an Addisonian crisis is the acute lack of cortisol, which leads to decreased vascular tone and poor response to catecholamines. While fluid resuscitation must be started immediately, replacing the deficient hormone is the most crucial action to stabilize the patient.",
            "opt_2": "Rationale: The client's blood glucose is low (62 mg/dL), and administering dextrose is a necessary intervention. However, the profound shock state, evidenced by a mean arterial pressure of 58 mmHg, is a more immediate threat to life than a blood glucose of 62 mg/dL. Correcting the circulatory collapse is the highest priority. Additionally, IV fluids administered will likely contain dextrose (e.g., D5NS), and the administration of hydrocortisone will also help increase blood glucose levels.",
            "opt_3": "Rationale: The client's potassium level is elevated at 5.9 mEq/L, which places them at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is an important assessment to evaluate for cardiac manifestations of hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves). However, this is an assessment/monitoring action, not a therapeutic intervention to reverse the life-threatening crisis. The priority is to implement treatments that will stabilize the client.",
            "opt_4": "Rationale: Correct. The client is experiencing an Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening state of acute adrenal insufficiency. The primary cause is a severe deficiency of cortisol. Administering intravenous hydrocortisone is the priority action because it directly treats the underlying pathophysiological cause of the crisis. Cortisol replacement is essential to restore vascular tone, reverse hypotension, correct electrolyte imbalances, and stabilize the client's hemodynamic status. Without steroid replacement, fluid resuscitation and other interventions will be less effective.",
            "opt_5": "Rationale: This action is incorrect and potentially harmful. The client is hypoglycemic (glucose 62 mg/dL), not hyperglycemic. Administering insulin would cause the blood glucose to drop further, leading to severe hypoglycemia, seizures, coma, and death.",
            "opt_6": "Rationale: The client's fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F) is likely due to the underlying infection (gastroenteritis) that precipitated the crisis. While managing the fever is important for comfort and to reduce metabolic demand, it is not the priority. The life-threatening hypotension and electrolyte imbalances must be addressed first. The fever can be treated after initiating life-saving interventions."
