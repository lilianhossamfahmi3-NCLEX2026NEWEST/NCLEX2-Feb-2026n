      "opt_1": "Rationale: While IV fluids are essential, they are secondary to hormone replacement. In Addisonian crisis, profound hypovolemia results from mineralocorticoid deficiency (aldosterone), leading to sodium and water loss. Hypotension is exacerbated by cortisol deficiency, reducing vascular tone and responsiveness to catecholamines. 0.9% sodium chloride expands the intravascular volume, improving blood pressure and organ perfusion. However, without cortisol, the body cannot effectively utilize fluids.",
      "opt_2": "Rationale: Hypoglycemia (glucose 62 mg/dL) is common in Addisonian crisis due to cortisol's role in gluconeogenesis. Administering 50% dextrose addresses this. However, the priority is cortisol replacement. Hydrocortisone stimulates gluconeogenesis, raising blood glucose. Addressing the hormonal deficiency will have a more sustained effect on glucose levels and overall stabilization.",
      "opt_3": "Rationale: Hyperkalemia (potassium 5.9 mEq/L) is a significant risk in Addisonian crisis due to aldosterone deficiency, which impairs potassium excretion. An ECG is important to assess for cardiac effects of hyperkalemia (peaked T waves, widened QRS). However, this is diagnostic, not therapeutic. While monitoring is crucial, the priority is to address the underlying hormonal deficiency with hydrocortisone, which will indirectly help correct the hyperkalemia.",
      "opt_4": "Rationale: Correct. The client is in Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening condition caused by acute adrenal insufficiency. This leads to severe cortisol and aldosterone deficiency. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that replaces the deficient cortisol. It restores vascular tone, improves blood pressure, corrects electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), and supports glucose homeostasis. Without immediate hydrocortisone administration, the client's condition will rapidly deteriorate, leading to shock and death. The rapid administration of hydrocortisone is the single most important intervention.",
      "opt_5": "Rationale: Incorrect. The client is hypoglycemic, not hyperglycemic. Administering insulin would further decrease blood glucose, worsening the client's condition and potentially causing seizures, coma, or death. This action is contraindicated.",
      "opt_6": "Rationale: The client's fever (38.5°C/101.3°F) is likely due to an underlying infection (gastroenteritis) that triggered the Addisonian crisis. While managing fever is important for comfort and reducing metabolic demand, it is not the priority. The life-threatening hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and hormonal deficiencies must be addressed first. The fever can be managed after initiating life-saving interventions like hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation."
