    "correct": "The client's presentation (sudden high-pressure alarm, hypotension, tachycardia, desaturation, unilateral absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation) strongly suggests a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency. High PEEP in ARDS can cause alveolar rupture, leading to air accumulation in the pleural space. This compresses the lung, mediastinum, and great vessels, causing obstructive shock. Preparing for immediate needle decompression is the priority to relieve pressure and restore hemodynamic stability.",
    "incorrect": "Obtaining a chest x-ray delays critical treatment. Increasing FiO2 doesn't address the mechanical compression. Sedation masks the underlying problem and can worsen respiratory depression. Decreasing PEEP will cause alveolar collapse and worsen oxygenation.",

        "content": "Incorrect. While a chest x-ray confirms pneumothorax, a *tension* pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis requiring immediate intervention.
