  "question": "A 54-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder is brought to the emergency department (ED) by their spouse at 1400 due to confusion and ataxia. The spouse reports the client started hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for hypertension three weeks ago and has had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past two days. The client is lethargic with coarse hand tremors. The nurse reviews the initial laboratory results and vital signs. Based on this data, the nurse determines the appropriate plan of care.\n\nThe nurse recognizes the client is experiencing acute lithium toxicity. The nurse should first prioritize __(1)__, followed by preparing for __(2)__. The nurse anticipates an order to __(3)__ the client's lithium and the newly prescribed __(4)__.",

    "cjjmRationale": "This question requires the nurse to analyze the client's presentation (altered mental status, ataxia, tremors, GI distress, recent HCTZ initiation) and lab values (elevated lithium, hyponatremia, elevated BUN/Creatinine) to recognize acute lithium toxicity and then generate appropriate and prioritized interventions. The priority is stabilizing the client's cardiovascular system, addressing dehydration, and preventing further lithium absorption.",
    "options": [
      {
        "blankId": "1",
        "option": "initiating continuous cardiac monitoring",
        "rationale": "Correct. Lithium toxicity can cause significant cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias (bradycardia, tachycardia, prolonged QT interval), hypotension, and even cardiac arrest. The client's tachycardia (HR 110 bpm) and electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia) increase the risk of dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial for early detection and management of life-threatening arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Always assess for cardiac effects in lithium toxicity, even if the client doesn't report chest pain or palpitations.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "blankId": "1",
        "option": "administering an antiemetic",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While nausea and vomiting are present, they are secondary to the lithium toxicity. Addressing the underlying cause and stabilizing the client's cardiovascular and neurological status are higher priorities. An antiemetic can be administered later if nausea persists after initial stabilization.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "1",
        "option": "inserting an indwelling urinary catheter",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While accurate intake and output monitoring is important, it is not the immediate priority. The focus should be on stabilizing the client's cardiovascular status and initiating fluid resuscitation. An indwelling catheter may be considered later if the client's condition warrants it (e.g., inability to void, strict monitoring of urine output).",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "1",
        "option": "obtaining a detailed psychiatric history",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a thorough psychiatric history is important for long-term management, it is not the priority in an acute medical crisis. The immediate focus is on stabilizing the client's physiological status and preventing further harm from lithium toxicity. The psychiatric history can be obtained once the client is medically stable.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "2",
        "option": "intravenous fluid resuscitation",
        "rationale": "Correct. The client's vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure (105/60 mmHg), elevated BUN/Creatinine, and hyponatremia (Na 132 mEq/L) indicate dehydration and potential renal impairment. Dehydration reduces renal clearance of lithium, exacerbating the toxicity. IV fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to restore hemodynamic stability, correct hyponatremia, and promote renal excretion of lithium. Clinical Pearl: Monitor serum sodium levels closely during fluid resuscitation, as rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to central pontine myelinolysis.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "blankId": "2",
        "option": "gastric lavage",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Gastric lavage is only effective within one hour of lithium ingestion. In this case, the client's toxicity developed over several days, indicating that the lithium has already been absorbed systemically. Gastric lavage is not indicated at this stage.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "2",
        "option": "administration of a beta-blocker",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's tachycardia is likely a compensatory mechanism due to dehydration and lithium toxicity. Administering a beta-blocker without addressing the underlying cause could worsen hypotension and compromise tissue perfusion. Beta-blockers are not a standard treatment for lithium toxicity.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "2",
        "option": "implementing seizure precautions",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While seizures are a potential complication of severe lithium toxicity, they are not the immediate priority. The focus should be on preventing seizures by reducing the lithium level through IV fluids and potentially hemodialysis. Seizure precautions are a supportive measure that should be implemented, but fluid resuscitation is the primary intervention.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "blankId": "3",
        "option": "discontinue",
        "rationale": "Correct. With a serum lithium level of 2.8 mEq/L, which is in the severe toxicity range (therapeutic range is 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), the offending medication (lithium) must be immediately discontinued to prevent further absorption and worsening of the client's condition. Pathophysiology: Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys. When lithium levels are elevated, it can disrupt neuronal function, leading to neurological symptoms like confusion, ataxia, and tremors.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. A dose reduction is insufficient and unsafe for a client with a toxic lithium level of 2.8 mEq/L and significant neurological and GI symptoms. The medication must be completely held to prevent further accumulation and toxicity.",

        "blankId": "3",
        "option": "administer an antidote for",

      {
        "blankId": "4",
        "option": "hydrochlorothiazide",
        "rationale": "Correct. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic that promotes sodium and water excretion. This leads to increased reabsorption of lithium in the proximal renal tubules, causing lithium levels to rise. HCTZ reduces sodium levels, which causes the kidneys to retain lithium. This medication is the likely precipitating factor for the toxicity and must also be discontinued. Pathophysiology: Thiazide diuretics increase lithium reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to elevated serum lithium levels. Clinical Pearl: Always assess for potential drug interactions when a client on lithium starts a new medication, especially diuretics.",

        "blankId": "4",
        "option": "antipsychotic medication",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While clients with bipolar disorder may also take antipsychotics, these medications do not directly cause lithium toxicity in this manner. The focus must be on the precipitating agent, which in this classic scenario is the diuretic.",

      {
        "blankId": "4",
        "option": "mood stabilizer",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Lithium itself is the mood stabilizer that is causing the toxicity. This option is redundant and does not identify the precipitating agent (HCTZ).",

        "blankId": "4",
        "option": "antidepressant medication",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Antidepressants are not the class of medication responsible for precipitating lithium toxicity in this manner. The interaction between lithium and thiazide diuretics is a well-established and critical nursing consideration.",
