    "question": "A 54-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder is brought to the emergency department by their spouse due to confusion and ataxia. The spouse reports the client started hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension three weeks ago and has had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past two days. The client is lethargic with coarse hand tremors. The nurse reviews the initial laboratory results and vital signs. Based on this data, the nurse determines the appropriate plan of care.\n\nThe nurse recognizes the client is experiencing acute lithium toxicity. The nurse should first prioritize __(1)__, followed by preparing for __(2)__. The nurse anticipates an order to __(3)__ the client's lithium and the newly prescribed __(4)__.",

        "cjjmRationale": "This question requires the nurse to use the recognized cues (lethargy, tremors, ataxia, GI distress, recent HCTZ start) and analyzed data (lithium toxicity) to generate solutions. The nurse must determine the most appropriate and prioritized interventions to manage the client's condition, which involves stabilizing the client, addressing the underlying cause, and preventing further harm. This aligns with the CJMM step of Generate Solutions, which focuses on identifying desired outcomes and determining appropriate interventions.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Lithium toxicity can cause cardiovascular effects, including dysrhythmias, bradycardia, and T-wave changes. The client's tachycardia (HR 110) in the context of a critically high lithium level (2.8 mEq/L) makes cardiac monitoring the highest priority to detect and manage life-threatening arrhythmias.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client has nausea and vomiting, these are symptoms of the underlying toxicity. Addressing the life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological risks is a higher priority than symptomatic treatment of nausea.",

            },

                "option": "inserting an indwelling urinary catheter",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While strict intake and output monitoring is important, especially with anticipated IV fluid resuscitation, it is not the immediate first priority. Cardiovascular assessment and stabilization take precedence over bladder management.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. In an acute medical crisis like severe lithium toxicity, physiological stabilization is the priority. While a psychiatric history is part of a comprehensive assessment, it can be obtained after the client is medically stable.",

                "option": "intravenous fluid resuscitation",
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's vomiting, diarrhea, and low blood pressure (105/60 mmHg) indicate dehydration. Dehydration and sodium depletion (Na 132 mEq/L) decrease renal clearance of lithium, worsening the toxicity. Intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to restore hemodynamic stability, correct hyponatremia, and promote renal excretion of lithium.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. Gastric lavage is only considered for acute lithium overdose within one hour of ingestion. This client's toxicity has developed over several days, so the lithium is already absorbed systemically, rendering lavage ineffective.",

While seizures are a potential complication of severe lithium toxicity, proactive interventions like IV fluids to decrease the lithium level are a higher priority. Seizure precautions are a supportive measure, but fluid resuscitation is a primary treatment.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that promotes sodium and water excretion. This leads to increased reabsorption of lithium in the proximal renal tubules, causing lithium levels to rise. This medication is the likely precipitating factor for the toxicity and must also be discontinued.",
