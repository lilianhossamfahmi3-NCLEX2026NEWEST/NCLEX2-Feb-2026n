However, it typically does not cause a significant increase in plateau pressure, as Pplat reflects alveolar pressure, not airway resistance. Furthermore, while mucous plugging can cause hypoxemia, it is less likely to cause such profound and rapid hemodynamic collapse (MAP dropping from 73 to 52 in 4 hours)."

Oxygenation worsened (PaO2 decreased from 62 to 51), airway pressures rose alarmingly (PIP 38 to 55), and hemodynamic stability was lost (MAP 73 to 52). This indicates a negative response or a complication, not improvement."
