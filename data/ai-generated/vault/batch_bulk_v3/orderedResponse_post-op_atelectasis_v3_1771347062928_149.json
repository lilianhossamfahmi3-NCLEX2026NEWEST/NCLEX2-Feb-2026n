    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes the client's immediate physiological needs based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The client's SpO2 of 91% indicates hypoxemia, requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. Applying oxygen via nasal cannula addresses this critical need. Pain (5/10) exacerbates shallow breathing, contributing to atelectasis. Administering prescribed pain medication allows for deeper breaths and effective coughing. Once pain is managed and oxygenation is improved, instructing the client on incentive spirometry with incisional splinting promotes alveolar expansion and prevents further atelectasis. Ambulation encourages lung expansion and secretion mobilization. Finally, after initiating these interventions, the healthcare provider should be notified to report the client's condition, interventions, and response for collaborative management. This ensures comprehensive care and allows for further medical orders if needed.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to adverse outcomes. Delaying oxygen administration in a hypoxemic client can result in tissue hypoxia and further respiratory compromise. Attempting incentive spirometry without pain management is often ineffective due to the client's inability to take deep breaths. Ambulation before addressing oxygenation and pain can lead to increased distress and potential falls. Notifying the provider before initiating any interventions delays critical care that the nurse can independently provide within their scope of practice. Each intervention builds upon the previous one to achieve optimal respiratory function and prevent complications.",

    "Monitor for signs of pneumonia, such as increased temperature, purulent sputum, and worsening respiratory status.",
    "Atelectasis Pathophysiology: Anesthesia and pain post-surgery lead to shallow breathing and reduced lung expansion. This causes alveolar collapse (atelectasis). Decreased surfactant production can also contribute. The collapsed alveoli impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia. Retained secretions further exacerbate the problem, increasing the risk of infection and pneumonia."
