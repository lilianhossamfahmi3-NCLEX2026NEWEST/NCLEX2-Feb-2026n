The nurse completes an assessment and documents the following findings:\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n- Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)\n- Heart Rate: 98/min\n- Respiratory Rate: 24/min, shallow\n- Blood Pressure: 130/84 mmHg\n- SpO2: 91% on room air\n- Lungs: Diminished breath sounds in bilateral bases\n- Pain: Reports 5/10 abdominal incisional pain, which worsens with deep breathing\n\nThe nurse plans to intervene. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag the actions from the left to the right, placing them in the correct order of priority.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of interventions follows the principles of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) while addressing the underlying cause of the client's atelectasis. The first priority is to correct the client's hypoxemia (SpO2 91%) by applying supplemental oxygen. The second priority is to manage the client's pain, as uncontrolled pain is preventing effective deep breathing and coughing. Once the pain is managed, the nurse can then effectively coach the client on therapeutic respiratory exercises, such as using the incentive spirometer with incisional splinting, to reinflate the collapsed alveoli. Following these immediate interventions, promoting mobility by ambulating helps to further expand the lungs and mobilize secretions. Finally, after initiating these critical interventions, the nurse should notify the healthcare provider to report the client's condition, the interventions performed, and the client's response.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect order would fail to prioritize immediate physiological needs. For example, ambulating a client with an SpO2 of 91% and unmanaged pain would be unsafe and ineffective. Instructing on incentive spirometry before managing pain would be futile, as the client would be unable to take deep enough breaths to benefit from the device. Notifying the provider before taking any action would delay necessary care that is within the nurse's scope of practice to implement immediately.",
