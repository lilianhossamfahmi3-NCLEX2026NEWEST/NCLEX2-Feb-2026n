    "topic": "Bipolar Mania Nursing",
    "scenario": "A nurse on an inpatient psychiatric unit is caring for a 28-year-old client admitted 24 hours ago for an acute manic episode of Bipolar I Disorder. The nurse observes the client pacing rapidly in the day room, speaking loudly and tangentially to multiple peers about his 'revolutionary' plan to redesign the hospital's electronic health record system. The client then picks up a decorative plant, declaring it the 'new server,' and attempts to hand it to another client. The client has had minimal sleep and poor nutritional intake since admission.",
    "stem": "Which actions should the nurse take to manage the client's current behavior? Select all that apply.",
    "options": [
        {
            "id": "opt_5",

        {
            "optionId": "opt_1",
            "rationale": "Correct. Removing the client from an area with high environmental stimuli (the day room) helps to decrease agitation and distractibility. A quieter, less stimulating environment can promote calmness and make it easier for the nurse to communicate effectively with the client."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Engaging in the client's grandiose and delusional thinking (the EHR project) validates the thought process and can further escalate the manic episode. It is non-therapeutic and does not help orient the client to reality or address the disruptive behavior."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "rationale": "Correct. Clients in a manic state often have poor nutritional intake due to hyperactivity and an inability to sit still for meals. Offering a portable, high-calorie food (e.g., a sandwich, protein shake, or fruit) addresses their physiological needs for energy in a way that accommodates their behavior."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "rationale": "Correct. It is essential to set clear, firm, and simple limits on unsafe or inappropriate behavior. This protects the client, other clients, and the environment. The statement is direct, non-judgmental, and focuses on the behavior without challenging the client's underlying belief, which helps to de-escalate the situation safely."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. This action would provide a platform for the client's grandiose behavior, potentially escalating their mania and disrupting the therapeutic milieu for all other clients. A client in an acute manic state is not capable of therapeutically leading a group."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While administering scheduled mood stabilizers like lithium is a crucial part of the overall treatment plan, it is not an immediate intervention for managing acute, escalating behavior. Lithium has a delayed therapeutic onset (7-14 days) and will not de-escalate the current situation. Immediate actions should focus on safety, de-escalation, and meeting physiological needs."
