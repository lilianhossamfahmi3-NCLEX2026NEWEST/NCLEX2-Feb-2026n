The first priority is to stop the causative agent (alteplase). The second priority is to confirm the diagnosis with an emergent non-contrast head CT. Continuous monitoring of neurological status via GCS and pupillary response is critical to detect further deterioration and signs of brainstem compression.",

Re-occlusion would present as worsening ischemic symptoms without the signs of increased ICP (headache, vomiting, Cushing's triad). An allergic reaction would involve hives, angioedema, or respiratory distress. A hypertensive crisis is present, but it is likely a symptom of the ICH (part of Cushing's triad) rather than the primary problem. Seizure activity is not described. The incorrect actions are either secondary (mannitol, intubation) or could be harmful (lowering BP precipitously without a confirmed diagnosis).
