A diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was made, and an IV alteplase infusion was initiated at 1415. At 1500, the nurse performs a neurological assessment and obtains vital signs. Based on the provided clinical information, what are the appropriate actions for the nurse to take and parameters to monitor? Drag the potential actions and parameters to the boxes on the right.",

The sudden severe headache, vomiting, drop in GCS from 15 to 10, development of anisocoria (unequal pupils), and Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) strongly suggest a hemorrhagic conversion of the ischemic stroke. The first priority is to stop the causative agent (alteplase). The second priority is to confirm the diagnosis with an emergent non-contrast head CT. Continuous monitoring of neurological status via GCS and pupillary response is critical to detect further deterioration and signs of brainstem compression.",
    "incorrect": "While the other conditions are possibilities in a stroke patient, they do not fit the clinical picture as well as hemorrhagic conversion. Re-occlusion would present as worsening ischemic symptoms without the signs of increased ICP (headache, vomiting, Cushing's triad). An allergic reaction would involve hives, angioedema, or respiratory distress. A hypertensive crisis is present, but it is likely a symptom of the ICH (part of Cushing's triad) rather than the primary problem. Seizure activity is not described. The incorrect actions are either secondary (mannitol, intubation) or could be harmful (lowering BP precipitously without a confirmed diagnosis). The incorrect parameters are less specific to the acute neurological crisis.",

The client's sudden neurological decline (decreased GCS), severe headache, vomiting, and new pupillary changes (anisocoria) after alteplase administration are hallmark signs. The development of Cushing's triad (hypertension: 190/105, bradycardia: 58 bpm, irregular respirations: 12/min) further supports this diagnosis, indicating significantly increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This triad reflects the brain's attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion in the face of rising ICP. The hypertension increases mean arterial pressure (MAP) to overcome the pressure gradient, while bradycardia is a vagal response. Irregular respirations result from pressure on the brainstem.",
