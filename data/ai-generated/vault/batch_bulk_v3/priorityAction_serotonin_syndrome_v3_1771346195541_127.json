The most life-threatening finding is the severe hyperthermia (40.5° C / 104.9° F). This condition can rapidly progress to rhabdomyolysis, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ failure. The absolute priority is to rapidly reduce the core body temperature to prevent irreversible organ damage. Therefore, initiating aggressive external cooling measures is the first and most critical action.",
        "incorrect": "While other options represent components of serotonin syndrome management, they are not the immediate priority. Administering lorazepam is a key treatment for agitation and myoclonus but does not reduce core temperature as quickly as direct cooling. Cyproheptadine is an antidote but is secondary to stabilizing life-threatening symptoms. Acetaminophen is ineffective because the hyperthermia is caused by muscle activity, not a change in the hypothalamic set point. Delaying cooling to perform these other actions could result in significant harm.",

While benzodiazepines like lorazepam are a first-line treatment for controlling agitation and neuromuscular excitation in serotonin syndrome, they are not the top priority when life-threatening hyperthermia is present.
