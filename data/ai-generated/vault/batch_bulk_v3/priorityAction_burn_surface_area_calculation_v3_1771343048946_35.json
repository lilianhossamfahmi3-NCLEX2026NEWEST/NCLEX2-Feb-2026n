The client has soot around the nares, a hoarse voice, and a persistent dry cough.",

        "correct": "The priority action is to prepare for immediate endotracheal intubation. The client's presentation with soot around the nares, a hoarse voice, and a dry cough after being in a closed-space fire are classic signs of a significant inhalation injury. This can lead to rapid and severe upper airway edema, causing complete airway obstruction. Securing the airway prophylactically, before edema makes it impossible, is the most critical life-saving intervention and aligns with the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) prioritization framework.",
        "incorrect": "While fluid resuscitation, pain management, and wound care are all essential components of burn management, they are not the immediate priority over securing a patent airway. Initiating fluids is the next critical step after the airway is managed. Administering morphine could worsen respiratory status. Wound care is performed after the client is hemodynamically stabilized.",
