    "correct": "The priority action is to prepare for immediate endotracheal intubation. The client's presentation with soot around the nares, a hoarse voice, and a dry cough after being in a closed-space fire are classic signs of a significant inhalation injury. Inhalation injuries cause inflammation and edema in the upper airway. This can lead to rapid and severe upper airway edema, causing complete airway obstruction. Securing the airway prophylactically, before edema makes intubation impossible, is the most critical life-saving intervention and aligns with the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) prioritization framework. Early intubation prevents hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.",
    "incorrect": "While fluid resuscitation, pain management, and wound care are all essential components of burn management, they are not the immediate priority over securing a patent airway. Initiating fluids is the next critical step after the airway is managed. Administering morphine could worsen respiratory status. Wound care is performed after the client is hemodynamically stabilized.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Administering IV morphine is incorrect as the priority action. While the client is undoubtedly in severe pain, opioid analgesics can cause respiratory depression, which is extremely hazardous for a client with a suspected inhalation injury and potential airway compromise. Respiratory depression further compromises oxygenation in a client already at risk for airway obstruction.",

        "content": "Initiating fluid resuscitation is incorrect as the first priority. The client has an estimated 36% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burn (Anterior Trunk=18%, Right Arm=9%, Anterior Right Leg=9%), which requires aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent burn shock. Burn shock occurs due to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, leading to hypovolemia and decreased cardiac output. While crucial, fluid resuscitation addresses circulation ('C'), which comes after securing the airway ('A') and ensuring adequate breathing ('B').",

The airway is at imminent risk of closing due to edema. Prophylactic intubation is crucial to maintain a patent airway, which is the highest priority according to ABCs. Inhalation injury can cause both upper and lower airway damage, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and long-term pulmonary complications.",

Look for signs like soot around the nares, hoarseness, cough, and stridor. Remember that pulse oximetry may be falsely elevated in carbon monoxide poisoning, so ABGs are crucial.",
