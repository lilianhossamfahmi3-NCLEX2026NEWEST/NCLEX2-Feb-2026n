    "correct": "The management of SIADH focuses on treating the underlying cause, correcting the dilutional hyponatremia, and preventing complications. Key nursing interventions include ensuring client safety due to the risk of seizures from severe hyponatremia (Na+ < 120 mEq/L), implementing a strict fluid restriction to prevent further water retention, performing frequent neurological checks to monitor for cerebral edema, and administering hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) as prescribed to slowly and carefully increase the serum sodium level. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** In SIADH, excessive ADH leads to increased water reabsorption in the kidneys, causing dilutional hyponatremia and decreased serum osmolality. This fluid shift can lead to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, manifesting as confusion, headache, and potentially seizures. Hypertonic saline helps draw fluid out of the cells and back into the vascular space, correcting the sodium imbalance. Fluid restriction limits further dilution of serum sodium. Neurological assessments monitor for worsening cerebral edema.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that would worsen the client's condition are inappropriate. This includes administering desmopressin (which is an ADH analog and would exacerbate water retention), encouraging free water intake, or administering hypotonic IV solutions. These actions would further dilute the serum sodium, increasing the risk of severe complications like cerebral edema and seizures.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Desmopressin mimics ADH, further increasing water reabsorption and worsening hyponatremia. Hypotonic solutions add more free water to the body, exacerbating the dilutional effect. Encouraging water intake overwhelms the kidneys' ability to excrete excess fluid, leading to further sodium dilution and increased risk of cerebral edema.",

In SIADH, the body produces too much ADH, so administering more would worsen the fluid retention and hyponatremia.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Desmopressin acts on the kidneys to increase water reabsorption. In SIADH, the kidneys are already retaining too much water due to excessive ADH.",

Rapid correction of hyponatremia can also be dangerous, potentially causing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Therefore, careful monitoring and gradual correction are essential. When administering 3% saline, monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as crackles in the lungs and increased respiratory rate. A central line is preferred for administration due to the solution's hyperosmolarity and risk of phlebitis.",
