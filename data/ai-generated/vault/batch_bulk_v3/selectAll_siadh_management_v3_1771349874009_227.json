The nurse reviews the initial laboratory results:\n\n- Serum Sodium: 118 mEq/L (1.2 mmol/L)\n- Serum Osmolality: 260 mOsm/kg (260 mmol/kg)\n- Urine Specific Gravity: 1.035\n- Urine Osmolality: 950 mOsm/kg (950 mmol/kg)\n\nThe healthcare provider diagnoses Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). The nurse is developing the plan of care for this client. Which interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The management of SIADH focuses on treating the underlying cause, correcting the dilutional hyponatremia, and preventing complications. Key nursing interventions include ensuring client safety due to the risk of seizures from severe hyponatremia (Na+ < 120 mEq/L), implementing a strict fluid restriction to prevent further water retention, performing frequent neurological checks to monitor for cerebral edema, and administering hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) as prescribed to slowly and carefully increase the serum sodium level.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that would worsen the client's condition are inappropriate. This includes administering desmopressin (which is an ADH analog and would exacerbate water retention), encouraging free water intake, or administering hypotonic IV solutions. These actions would further dilute the serum sodium, increasing the risk of severe complications like cerebral edema and seizures.",
