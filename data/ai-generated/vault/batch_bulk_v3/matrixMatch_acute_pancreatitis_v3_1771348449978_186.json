    "correct": "The client presents with severe acute pancreatitis, evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, hypocalcemia, elevated amylase/lipase, leukocytosis, and Cullen's sign, indicating potential retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The priority is hemodynamic stabilization, pain management, electrolyte correction, and resting the pancreas to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. Aggressive IV fluids (0.9% NaCl) address hypovolemia due to third-spacing. IV calcium gluconate corrects hypocalcemia resulting from saponification. NG tube placement decompresses the stomach, reducing vomiting and pancreatic stimulation. Oral intake is contraindicated to minimize pancreatic enzyme release. Addressing alcohol cessation is important but secondary to immediate stabilization. Supine position exacerbates pain and respiratory compromise.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrectly classifying these interventions can lead to severe complications. Providing a diet would worsen pancreatic autodigestion and pain. Failing to provide fluids could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure. Ignoring the critical hypocalcemia could result in tetany or cardiac arrest. Using improper positioning can increase pain and exacerbate respiratory distress. Prioritizing non-essential tasks over life-sustaining interventions demonstrates a failure to correctly manage acute illness.",
