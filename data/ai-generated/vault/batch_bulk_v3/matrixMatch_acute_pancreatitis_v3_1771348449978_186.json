The correct plan of care prioritizes hemodynamic stabilization, pain management, electrolyte correction, and resting the pancreas. Therefore, aggressive IV fluids, IV calcium for hypocalcemia, and NG tube placement for gastric decompression are all indicated. Actions that stimulate the pancreas (oral diet) or worsen pain and respiratory compromise (supine position) are contraindicated. While addressing the underlying cause (alcohol use) is important, it is not the immediate life-saving priority.",

Failing to provide fluids could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure. Ignoring the critical hypocalcemia could result in tetany or cardiac arrest. Using improper positioning can increase pain and exacerbate respiratory distress. Prioritizing non-essential tasks over life-sustaining interventions demonstrates a failure to correctly manage acute illness.",
