    "question": "The nurse is caring for a client with schizophrenia in an inpatient psychiatric unit. Which action should the nurse take first?",
    "stem": "The nurse receives a report on a 28-year-old client with schizophrenia admitted 12 hours ago for acute psychosis. The client has been pacing the hallway, muttering to themselves, and clenching their fists. During the nurse's initial assessment, the client states, 'That man in the blue shirt is a spy. He's sending signals to the aliens. I have to stop him before he hurts us all.' The client is glaring at another client wearing a blue shirt in the dayroom.",
    "header": "The nurse should first...",
    "options": [
        "Document the client's paranoid delusions and agitated behavior.",
        "Offer the client a pre-packaged snack and beverage.",
        "Administer the prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine.",
        "Attempt to reorient the client to the current situation.",
        "Escort the client to a quiet room away from the dayroom."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Escort the client to a quiet room away from the dayroom.",
    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The priority action is to ensure the safety of the client and others on the unit. The client is exhibiting escalating agitation, paranoid delusions, and has identified a specific target, which indicates a high risk for aggression. Removing the client from the stimulating environment (the dayroom) and the perceived threat (the other client) to a quieter, less stimulating area is the most immediate and effective de-escalation strategy to prevent violence.",
        "incorrect": "While administering medication, offering food, documenting, and reorienting are all potential nursing interventions, they do not take precedence over immediate safety. Medication takes time to work, offering food does not address the agitation, documentation occurs after ensuring safety, and attempting to reorient a paranoid client may increase their agitation.",

                "content": "This is an appropriate intervention for psychosis and agitation, but it is not the priority action. Oral medication can take 30-60 minutes to take effect, and the nurse must first address the immediate safety risk posed by the client's escalating behavior.",

                "content": "This action can help build therapeutic rapport and address potential nutritional deficits, especially if the client is refusing meals due to paranoia. However, it fails to address the imminent risk of aggression and is not the priority in this escalating situation.",

                "content": "This action is the priority as it directly addresses the safety of both the client and the other person. By removing the client from the source of their paranoia and the overstimulating environment of the dayroom, the nurse is actively de-escalating the situation and preventing potential violence, which is the highest priority.",
