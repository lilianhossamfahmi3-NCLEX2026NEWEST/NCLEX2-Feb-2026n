  "passage": "A 48-year-old male with a history of bipolar I disorder, diagnosed 5 years ago, presents to the emergency department with his partner. The partner is concerned about recent changes in the client's behavior. The client states he recently started taking hydrochlorothiazide prescribed by his primary care provider for hypertension last week. His last lithium dose was this morning. Vital signs are: Blood pressure 138/88 mmHg, Heart rate 92/min, Respiratory rate 18/min, Temperature 98.9°F (37.2°C). The client appears lethargic and exhibits coarse hand tremors. He reports persistent nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days. During the assessment, the nurse notes the client is confused and disoriented to time, demonstrates slurred speech, and has ataxia and an unsteady gait when attempting to walk to the restroom.",

    "correct": "The correct findings are coarse hand tremors, persistent nausea and vomiting, confusion/disorientation, slurred speech, and ataxia/unsteady gait. These are classic signs of moderate to severe lithium toxicity. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (0.6-1.2 mEq/L for maintenance, up to 1.5 mEq/L for acute mania). These symptoms indicate the level has likely exceeded the therapeutic range, leading to central nervous system (CNS) depression and gastrointestinal (GI) irritation. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, increases lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, leading to decreased lithium clearance and increased serum lithium levels. The pathophysiology involves lithium's interference with sodium transport in nerve and muscle cells, altering neurotransmitter release and receptor sensitivity. This disruption leads to the observed neurological and GI symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "The client's history, vital signs, and recent initiation of hydrochlorothiazide are important data points but are not direct indicators of *current* toxicity. While hydrochlorothiazide is a significant risk factor for developing toxicity (as it can increase lithium reabsorption in the kidneys), it is a *cause*, not a symptom. The vital signs are relatively stable and non-specific.",

        "label": "States he recently started taking hydrochlorothiazide",

This finding represents a significant risk factor for lithium toxicity, as thiazide diuretics can decrease renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased serum levels. However, it is a *precipitating factor*, not a clinical sign or symptom of toxicity itself. Thiazide diuretics inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium and water excretion. The body compensates by increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule, where lithium is also reabsorbed.",

        "label": "Coarse hand tremors",
        "content": "Correct. Fine hand tremors can be a common side effect of lithium, but the *development* of coarse tremors is a classic sign of *advancing* lithium toxicity, indicating significant CNS effects. Lithium's interference with neuronal sodium channels disrupts normal nerve impulse transmission, leading to tremors.",

      {
        "label": "Reports persistent nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days",
        "content": "Correct. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are early and common gastrointestinal signs of lithium toxicity as the medication irritates the GI lining. Lithium directly irritates the gastric mucosa, stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brainstem, which induces nausea and vomiting.",

Confusion, disorientation, and lethargy are significant neurotoxic effects of elevated lithium levels, indicating moderate to severe toxicity that requires immediate intervention. Lithium toxicity affects the CNS by disrupting neurotransmitter balance and neuronal excitability, leading to altered mental status.",

        "label": "Slurred speech",
