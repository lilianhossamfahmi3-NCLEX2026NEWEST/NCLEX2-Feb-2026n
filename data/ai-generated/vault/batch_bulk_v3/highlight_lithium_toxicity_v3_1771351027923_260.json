    "passage": "A 48-year-old male with a history of bipolar I disorder, diagnosed 5 years ago, presents to the emergency department with his partner. The partner is concerned about recent changes in the client's behavior. The client states he recently started taking hydrochlorothiazide prescribed by his primary care provider for hypertension last week. His last lithium dose was this morning. Vital signs are: Blood pressure 138/88 mmHg, Heart rate 92/min, Respiratory rate 18/min, Temperature 98.9°F (37.2°C). The client appears lethargic and exhibits coarse hand tremors. He reports persistent nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days. During the assessment, the nurse notes the client is confused and disoriented to time, demonstrates slurred speech, and has ataxia and an unsteady gait when attempting to walk to the restroom.",

        "correct": "The correct findings are coarse hand tremors, persistent nausea and vomiting, confusion/disorientation, slurred speech, and ataxia/unsteady gait. These are classic neurological and gastrointestinal signs of moderate to severe lithium toxicity. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, and these symptoms indicate the level has likely exceeded the therapeutic range, leading to central nervous system depression and irritation of the GI tract.",
        "incorrect": "The client's history, vital signs, and recent initiation of hydrochlorothiazide are important data points but are not direct indicators of current toxicity. While hydrochlorothiazide is a significant risk factor for developing toxicity (as it can increase lithium reabsorption in the kidneys), it is a cause, not a symptom. The vital signs are relatively stable and non-specific.",
