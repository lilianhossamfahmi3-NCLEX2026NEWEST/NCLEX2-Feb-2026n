        "correct": "The client's presentation of polyuria (urine output >200 mL/hr), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and pale urine following pituitary surgery is highly indicative of diabetes insipidus (DI). This condition results from a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The correct nursing actions focus on replacing fluid volume, administering synthetic ADH (desmopressin), and closely monitoring the client's fluid and electrolyte status. Monitoring urine specific gravity and intake/output are essential for evaluating the severity of DI and the client's response to treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Actions appropriate for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), such as fluid restriction and administration of hypertonic saline, are contraindicated and dangerous for a client with DI. Fluid restriction would exacerbate the client's dehydration and hypernatremia, potentially leading to seizures, coma, and death. Administering hypertonic saline would further increase the serum sodium level, which is already elevated or at risk of elevating in DI.",
