In sepsis, tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of vasodilation and potential hypovolemia.",
            "opt_2": "Incorrect. Hypoactive bowel sounds are an expected finding 3 days after a sigmoid colectomy due to manipulation of the bowel and the effects of anesthesia. While a prolonged ileus can be a concern, it is not as immediately life-threatening as the other signs of hemodynamic instability.",
            "opt_3": "Incorrect. While a pain rating of 7/10 needs to be addressed, a moderate to severe level of pain is an expected finding following major abdominal surgery. The change in the character of the pain ('all over') is concerning, but the other options are more direct indicators of systemic sepsis and organ dysfunction.",
            "opt_4": "Correct. The WBC count has significantly increased from 11.5 to 18.2 x 10⁹/L (normal 4.5-11.0 x 10⁹/L). This leukocytosis indicates a robust and worsening systemic infection, a key criterion in the diagnosis of sepsis, likely from an anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess.",
            "opt_5": "Incorrect. The hemoglobin has only slightly decreased from 12.8 to 12.5 g/dL. This is a clinically insignificant change and effectively rules out acute hemorrhage as the primary cause for the client's tachycardia and hypotension.",
            "opt_6": "Correct. The client's change from 'Alert and oriented x3' to 'Restless, oriented to person only' is a critical finding. This acute change in mental status is a sign of end-organ dysfunction (in this case, the brain) due to cerebral hypoperfusion and the systemic effects of sepsis.",
            "opt_7": "Correct. The lactate level has risen from a normal 1.1 mmol/L to an elevated 2.9 mmol/L. An elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) is a specific marker of tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism, which is a hallmark of septic shock and is associated with increased mortality.",
            "opt_8": "Incorrect. While a fever of 38.9°C (102.0°F) is a component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and is concerning, it is one of many signs. The other correct options (hemodynamic instability, organ dysfunction, and evidence of anaerobic metabolism) represent a more advanced and critical state of sepsis that requires more urgent intervention."
