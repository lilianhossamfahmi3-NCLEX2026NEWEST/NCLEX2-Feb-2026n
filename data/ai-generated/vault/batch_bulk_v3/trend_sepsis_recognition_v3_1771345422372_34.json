    "rationales": {
      "opt_1": "Correct. A heart rate of 118 bpm indicates tachycardia. The client's heart rate has been trending upwards (92 bpm, 104 bpm, 118 bpm). Tachycardia is an early compensatory mechanism in sepsis to maintain cardiac output due to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The body attempts to compensate for reduced blood pressure by increasing the heart rate. Clinical Pearl: Persistent tachycardia despite fluid resuscitation warrants further investigation for underlying causes like sepsis or hypovolemia.",
      "opt_2": "Incorrect. Hypoactive bowel sounds are common after abdominal surgery due to anesthesia and bowel manipulation. While prolonged ileus is a concern, it's not as immediately life-threatening as signs of hemodynamic instability or organ dysfunction. The absence of bowel sounds is expected post-op. Clinical Pearl: Monitor bowel sounds, but prioritize assessment of vital signs and other indicators of sepsis.",
      "opt_3": "Incorrect. While a pain rating of 7/10 requires intervention, it is expected post-operatively. The change in location ('all over') could indicate a complication, but other findings are more indicative of sepsis. Post-operative pain is common and should be addressed, but it is not the priority in this scenario. Clinical Pearl: Differentiate between expected post-operative pain and pain that may indicate a complication.",
      "opt_4": "Correct. A WBC count of 18.2 x 10⁹/L indicates leukocytosis, a significant increase from the client's baseline of 11.5 x 10⁹/L. Leukocytosis is a hallmark of infection and inflammation. In sepsis, the body releases more WBCs to fight the infection. This is a key indicator of a systemic inflammatory response. Clinical Pearl: Monitor trends in WBC count, as a rapidly increasing WBC count can indicate worsening infection.",
      "opt_5": "Incorrect. A hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL is within normal limits and represents a minimal change from the client's baseline of 12.8 g/dL. This small change is not clinically significant and does not indicate acute blood loss or anemia. Hemoglobin levels are not the primary concern in this scenario. Clinical Pearl: While hemoglobin is important, it is not the most concerning lab value in this scenario.",
      "opt_6": "Correct. A change in level of consciousness from 'Alert and oriented x3' to 'Restless, oriented to person only' indicates neurological dysfunction. This can be caused by decreased cerebral perfusion due to hypotension, hypoxia, or the effects of inflammatory mediators on the brain. Altered mental status is a key sign of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Clinical Pearl: Changes in mental status, even subtle ones, should be investigated promptly, especially in patients at risk for sepsis.",
      "opt_7": "Correct. A lactate level of 2.9 mmol/L is elevated (normal <2 mmol/L). Elevated lactate indicates tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. In sepsis, poor tissue perfusion leads to anaerobic metabolism, resulting in increased lactate production. Elevated lactate is a marker of sepsis severity and is associated with increased mortality. Clinical Pearl: Lactate levels are a critical indicator of tissue perfusion and should be monitored closely in patients with suspected sepsis.",
      "opt_8": "Incorrect. A temperature of 38.9°C (102.0°F) indicates fever, which is a component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. While fever is concerning, the other options (tachycardia, leukocytosis, altered mental status, and elevated lactate) are more specific indicators of sepsis and organ dysfunction. Clinical Pearl: Fever is a common sign of infection, but it is not always present in sepsis, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients."
