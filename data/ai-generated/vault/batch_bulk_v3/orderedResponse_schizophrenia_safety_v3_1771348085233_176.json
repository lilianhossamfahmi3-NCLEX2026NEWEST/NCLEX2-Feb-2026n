The nurse enters the dayroom and finds the client pacing, shouting, \"The agents are in the walls! They are broadcasting my thoughts!\" The client is clenching his fists and glaring at other clients who are watching television. The nurse must intervene to ensure safety. Arrange the following nursing actions in the order they should be performed, from first to last.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes the safety of all individuals while adhering to the principle of using the least restrictive intervention first. The immediate priority is to ensure the safety of other clients by removing them from the potentially volatile situation. The nurse then ensures their own safety by calling for backup before approaching the agitated client. With a safe environment established, the nurse attempts the least restrictive de-escalation technique (verbal). If that fails, a more restrictive intervention (chemical restraint via PRN medication) is offered. The most restrictive intervention (seclusion) is reserved as the final option if the client's behavior escalates to pose an imminent danger to self or others.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these actions could compromise the safety of clients and staff, or violate the client's rights by prematurely using a more restrictive intervention. For example, approaching the client before removing others or calling for help places everyone at risk. Similarly, resorting to medication or seclusion before attempting verbal de-escalation fails to follow the principle of least restrictive intervention, which is a key tenet of mental health nursing.",
