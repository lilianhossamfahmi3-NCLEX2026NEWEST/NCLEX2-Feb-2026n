A gallstone can obstruct the common bile duct or the ampulla of Vater, leading to a backup of pancreatic enzymes and autodigestion of the pancreas. This is a primary risk factor and a significant cue."

In acute pancreatitis, massive fluid shifts from the vascular space into the retroperitoneal space ('third-spacing') and a systemic inflammatory response can lead to hypovolemic shock. This is a sign of severe pancreatitis."
