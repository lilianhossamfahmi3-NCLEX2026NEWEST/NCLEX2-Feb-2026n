        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. Cholelithiasis is a major etiological factor in acute pancreatitis. Gallstones can obstruct the pancreatic duct, leading to enzyme backup and pancreatic autodigestion. This is a critical risk factor to highlight.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Cholelithiasis accounts for approximately 40% of acute pancreatitis cases. Assess for right upper quadrant pain history."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While chronic alcohol abuse is a significant cause of pancreatitis, occasional social use is less likely to be the primary cause, especially with a history of cholelithiasis. Focus on the more probable etiology.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Chronic alcohol use typically involves years of heavy consumption. Rule out other causes before attributing pancreatitis to occasional alcohol intake."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. This is a classic symptom of acute pancreatitis. The pain results from pancreatic inflammation and enzyme leakage, irritating surrounding nerves. The retroperitoneal location of the pancreas causes the back pain.",
        "clinicalPearl": "The pain of pancreatitis is often described as 'boring' and unrelenting. It is typically exacerbated by lying supine."

        "text": "lying on her side with knees flexed",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. This position is often assumed by clients with pancreatitis to alleviate pain. Flexing the knees and lying on the side reduces abdominal muscle tension and pressure on the inflamed pancreas.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Encourage this position for comfort. It's a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce pain."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. Hypotension indicates potential hypovolemia and systemic inflammation. In pancreatitis, fluid shifts into the retroperitoneal space and inflammatory mediators cause vasodilation, leading to decreased blood pressure. This can progress to shock.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Hypotension is a late sign of pancreatitis and requires immediate intervention with IV fluids."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. Diminished bowel sounds suggest a paralytic ileus, a common complication of pancreatitis. Inflammation irritates the bowel, inhibiting peristalsis. This can lead to abdominal distension and further discomfort.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Monitor bowel sounds frequently. Absent bowel sounds require immediate notification of the healthcare provider."

        "rationale": "Correct. This describes Cullen's sign, indicative of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. It occurs in severe necrotizing pancreatitis when pancreatic enzymes erode blood vessels. This is a critical finding requiring immediate intervention.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Cullen's sign is a late and ominous sign. It indicates severe disease and a high risk of mortality."

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Anicteric sclera indicate the absence of jaundice. While jaundice can occur if a gallstone obstructs the common bile duct, its absence does not rule out pancreatitis. It's a normal finding and not a priority.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Jaundice is more common in gallstone pancreatitis. Its absence doesn't exclude the diagnosis."
