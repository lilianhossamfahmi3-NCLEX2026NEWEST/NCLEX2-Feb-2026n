        "correct": "The appropriate plan of care for a client with a myasthenia gravis exacerbation prioritizes airway protection, respiratory monitoring, medication efficacy for safe swallowing, and management of specific symptoms like diplopia. Myasthenic crisis, a life-threatening complication involving severe respiratory muscle weakness, necessitates having emergency airway equipment readily available. Frequent respiratory assessments are critical to detect early signs of respiratory compromise. Timing the administration of pyridostigmine to peak during meals enhances swallowing ability and reduces aspiration risk. Patching one eye is a simple, effective intervention to manage diplopia.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that increase muscle fatigue or pose a physiological risk are inappropriate. Large meals can fatigue the muscles used for chewing and swallowing, increasing the risk of aspiration; smaller, more frequent meals are recommended. The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure and can cause dangerous vagal stimulation and bradycardia. Activities should be planned for the morning when the client's muscle strength is at its peak, as weakness in myasthenia gravis characteristically worsens as the day progresses.",
