    "correct": "The appropriate plan of care for a client experiencing a myasthenia gravis exacerbation prioritizes maintaining a patent airway, monitoring respiratory function, optimizing medication efficacy to facilitate safe swallowing, and managing specific symptoms such as diplopia. Myasthenic crisis, a life-threatening complication characterized by severe weakness of the respiratory muscles, necessitates immediate access to emergency airway equipment. Continuous respiratory assessment is crucial to detect early signs of respiratory compromise. Pyridostigmine, an anticholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction, improving muscle strength. Administering pyridostigmine 30-60 minutes before meals allows the medication to reach peak effect, maximizing the strength of bulbar muscles involved in chewing and swallowing, thereby reducing the risk of aspiration. Patching one eye is a simple and effective intervention to alleviate diplopia by eliminating one of the two images the client is seeing.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that increase muscle fatigue or pose a physiological risk are inappropriate for clients with myasthenia gravis. Large meals can overwhelm the weakened muscles used for chewing and swallowing, increasing the risk of aspiration; smaller, more frequent meals are recommended to conserve energy. The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure and can cause dangerous vagal stimulation, leading to bradycardia and hypotension, which can be particularly detrimental in a client with neuromuscular weakness. Activities should be planned for the morning when the client's muscle strength is typically at its peak, as muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis characteristically worsens as the day progresses due to repetitive muscle use and fatigue.",
