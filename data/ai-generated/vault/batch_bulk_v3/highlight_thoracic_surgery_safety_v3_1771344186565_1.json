        "option": "The client is positioned in semi-Fowler's.",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Semi-Fowler's position is a therapeutic intervention post-lobectomy. Elevating the head of the bed promotes optimal lung expansion, facilitates drainage, and reduces the risk of aspiration. This position enhances ventilation and oxygenation, supporting the client's respiratory recovery.",

        "option": "The chest tube was briefly clamped to allow the patient to reposition higher in bed.",
        "rationale": "Correct. Clamping a chest tube, even briefly, without a specific physician order is a dangerous practice.  The chest tube is the only vent for air or fluid in the pleural space. Clamping it can lead to a rapid build-up of pressure, potentially causing a tension pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition where increased intrapleural pressure collapses the lung, shifts the mediastinum, and impairs venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiovascular collapse. This requires immediate intervention. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Never clamp a chest tube unless specifically ordered by a physician for a brief period (e.g., changing the drainage system) and always have vaseline gauze at the bedside.",

        "option": "The chest tube drainage system was placed on the bedside table to facilitate easier assessment.",
        "rationale": "Correct. The chest tube drainage system must remain below the level of the client's chest at all times. Elevating the system allows fluid to drain back into the pleural space, potentially causing a re-collapsed lung or empyema (pus in the pleural space). The negative pressure within the chest cavity relies on gravity to facilitate proper drainage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Ensure the chest tube drainage system is securely placed on the floor or hung on the bed frame below the level of the client's chest. Regularly assess the tubing for kinks or obstructions that could impede drainage.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect.  Post-lobectomy, serosanguinous drainage is expected.  150 mL over 2 hours (75 mL/hr) is within the normal range for the initial postoperative period.  While the nurse should continue to monitor the drainage amount, color, and consistency, this finding alone does not indicate a breach in safety standards.  A sudden increase in drainage or a change to bright red blood should be reported immediately.",

        "option": "Tidaling is present in the water seal chamber.",

It indicates that the chest tube system is patent and functioning correctly, allowing for the removal of air and fluid from the pleural space. Absence of tidaling may indicate lung re-expansion or an obstruction in the system (e.g., kinked tubing).",
