The chest tube was briefly clamped to allow the patient to reposition higher in bed. The chest tube drainage system was placed on the bedside table to facilitate easier assessment.

Drainage of up to 100-300 mL in the first few hours post-surgery is typical. The amount (75 mL/hr) is within the acceptable limit (generally <100 mL/hr).
