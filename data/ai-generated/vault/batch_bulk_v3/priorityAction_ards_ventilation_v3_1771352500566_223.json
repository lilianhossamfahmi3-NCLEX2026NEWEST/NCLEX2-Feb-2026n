The priority action is to immediately disconnect the client from the source of the positive pressure (the ventilator) and provide manual ventilation. This allows for immediate delivery of 100% oxygen and allows the nurse to assess lung compliance while removing the force that is worsening the pneumothorax. This is a critical, time-sensitive intervention to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",

            {
                "optionId": "opt_1",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While notifying the provider and RT is essential, it is not the first action. The nurse must intervene directly to stabilize the client who is actively decompensating. The principle of 'intervene then notify' applies here due to the life-threatening nature of the situation."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "rationale": "Correct. This is the immediate priority. Disconnecting from the ventilator removes the positive pressure that is causing air to accumulate in the pleural space and worsening the tension physiology. Manual ventilation with a bag-valve mask at 100% FiO2 supports oxygenation and allows the nurse to feel for lung compliance, confirming extremely high resistance. This action serves as both a diagnostic and therapeutic bridge until definitive treatment (needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion) can be performed."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Although a mucus plug can cause a high PIP alarm, the constellation of findings (tracheal deviation, asymmetrical chest movement, hemodynamic instability) makes a tension pneumothorax the most likely diagnosis. Suctioning would waste critical time and would not address the underlying life-threatening problem."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's agitation and tachycardia are physiological responses to severe hypoxemia and shock, not patient-ventilator asynchrony. Administering more sedation would mask the signs of deterioration, could worsen hypotension, and would fail to address the root cause of the crisis."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. A chest x-ray is used to confirm a diagnosis, but it should not delay life-saving treatment. The client's clinical signs are sufficient to diagnose a tension pneumothorax and initiate emergency intervention. Waiting for radiographic confirmation in a hemodynamically unstable client could be fatal."
