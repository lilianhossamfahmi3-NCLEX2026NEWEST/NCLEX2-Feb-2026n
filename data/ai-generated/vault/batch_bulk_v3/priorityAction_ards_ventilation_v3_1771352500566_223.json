The priority action is to immediately disconnect the client from the source of the positive pressure (the ventilator) and provide manual ventilation. This allows for immediate delivery of 100% oxygen and allows the nurse to assess lung compliance while removing the force that is worsening the pneumothorax. This is a critical, time-sensitive intervention to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",

        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While notifying the provider and RT is essential, it is not the first action.

        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. This is the immediate priority. Disconnecting from the ventilator removes the positive pressure that is causing air to accumulate in the pleural space and worsening the tension physiology. Manual ventilation with a bag-valve mask at 100% FiO2 supports oxygenation and allows the nurse to feel for lung compliance, confirming extremely high resistance.

  "rationale": "The client's presentation (sudden high PIP alarm post-repositioning, unilateral diminished breath sounds, tracheal deviation, hypotension, SpO2 83%) suggests a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening ARDS complication. Positive pressure ventilation can cause alveolar rupture, leading to air accumulation in the pleural space. This compresses the lung, shifts mediastinal structures, and impairs venous return, causing hypotension and hypoxemia. Disconnecting from the ventilator immediately removes the positive pressure exacerbating the pneumothorax. Manual ventilation with a bag-valve mask and 100% FiO2 provides immediate oxygenation and allows assessment of lung compliance. This is a critical temporizing measure until definitive treatment (needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube insertion) can be initiated. Delaying intervention can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.",
  "clinicalPearls": "Tension pneumothorax is a critical complication of mechanical ventilation. Rapid recognition and intervention are crucial. Remember the classic signs: sudden respiratory distress, unilateral decreased breath sounds, tracheal deviation, and hemodynamic instability. Always prioritize immediate intervention over diagnostic confirmation in a rapidly deteriorating patient.",
