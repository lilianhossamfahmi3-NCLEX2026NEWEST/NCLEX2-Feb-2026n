            "opt_01": "Correct. Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening condition caused by an acute deficiency of corticosteroids. Intravenous hydrocortisone (a glucocorticoid) is the cornerstone of treatment to replace cortisol, which will help reverse hypotension, normalize blood glucose, and improve overall stability.",
            "opt_02": "Correct. The client is experiencing profound hypotension (84/48 mmHg), hyponatremia (124 mEq/L), and signs of dehydration (elevated BUN/creatinine) due to aldosterone deficiency. A rapid infusion of an isotonic solution like 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to restore vascular volume and correct the sodium deficit.",
            "opt_03": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. The client is already hyperkalemic (6.2 mEq/L). Administering spironolactone would dangerously elevate potassium levels further, increasing the risk of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.",
            "opt_04": "Correct. The client is hypoglycemic (58 mg/dL). Intravenous 50% dextrose is necessary for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia, which contributes to the client's lethargy and confusion.",
            "opt_05": "Correct. The client's potassium level is critically high at 6.2 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, and ventricular fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for early detection and management of these arrhythmias.",
            "opt_06": "Incorrect. The client is severely hyponatremic (124 mEq/L) and volume depleted. Sodium replacement, not restriction, is a priority. The intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride is a key part of this replacement therapy.",
            "opt_07": "Correct. The client's sodium level is significantly low (124 mEq/L), and she is confused. Severe hyponatremia can lead to cerebral edema and seizures. Instituting seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at the bedside) is a critical safety measure.",
            "opt_08": "Incorrect. Administering potassium chloride to a client with a potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L is contraindicated and would be lethal. The priority is to lower the potassium level, not increase it."
