      "correctExplain": "Correct. The client's glucose is 58 mg/dL, indicating hypoglycemia. D50W IV bolus rapidly increases serum glucose levels, preventing neurological damage and providing energy for cellular function. In Addisonian crisis, hypoglycemia occurs due to cortisol deficiency, which impairs gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.",

Administering potassium chloride would further elevate potassium levels, potentially causing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias like peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, and ventricular fibrillation. This intervention is contraindicated."

      "incorrectExplain": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. The client is already hyperkalemic (6.2 mEq/L). Administering spironolactone would further increase potassium levels, exacerbating the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This medication is contraindicated in hyperkalemia."

Rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride expands intravascular volume, increasing blood pressure and improving tissue perfusion. It also corrects the sodium deficit. In Addisonian crisis, aldosterone deficiency leads to sodium and water loss.",

IV hydrocortisone replaces the deficient cortisol, reversing hypotension, improving blood glucose, and reducing inflammation. Hydrocortisone acts as both a glucocorticoid and a mineralocorticoid, addressing both cortisol and aldosterone deficiencies.",

      "opt_01": "Correct. Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening condition caused by an acute deficiency of corticosteroids. Intravenous hydrocortisone (a glucocorticoid) is the cornerstone of treatment to replace cortisol, which will help reverse hypotension, normalize blood glucose, and improve overall stability. Clinical Pearl: Administer IV hydrocortisone immediately; do not delay for lab results.",
      "opt_02": "Correct. The client is experiencing profound hypotension (84/48 mmHg), hyponatremia (124 mEq/L), and signs of dehydration (elevated BUN/creatinine) due to aldosterone deficiency. A rapid infusion of an isotonic solution like 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to restore vascular volume and correct the sodium deficit. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload during rapid infusion, such as crackles in the lungs and edema.",
      "opt_03": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. The client is already hyperkalemic (6.2 mEq/L). Administering spironolactone would dangerously elevate potassium levels further, increasing the risk of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.",
      "opt_04": "Correct. The client is hypoglycemic (58 mg/dL). Intravenous 50% dextrose is necessary for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia, which contributes to the client's lethargy and confusion. Clinical Pearl: Recheck blood glucose frequently after D50 administration to prevent rebound hypoglycemia.",
      "opt_05": "Correct. The client's potassium level is critically high at 6.2 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, and ventricular fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for early detection and management of these arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Be prepared to administer medications to lower potassium, such as calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate).",
      "opt_06": "Incorrect. The client is severely hyponatremic (124 mEq/L) and volume depleted. Sodium replacement, not restriction, is a priority. The intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride is a key part of this replacement therapy.",
      "opt_07": "Correct. The client's sodium level is significantly low (124 mEq/L), and she is confused. Severe hyponatremia can lead to cerebral edema and seizures. Instituting seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at the bedside) is a critical safety measure. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, vomiting, and altered level of consciousness.",
      "opt_08": "Incorrect. Administering potassium chloride to a client with a potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L is contraindicated and would be lethal. The priority is to lower the potassium level, not increase it."
