    "correct": "The correct plan for fluid resuscitation is based on the accurate calculation and application of the Parkland formula. First, the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) is calculated using the Rule of Nines: Anterior Torso (18%) + Entire Right Arm (9%) + Anterior Right Leg (9%) = 36% TBSA. Next, the total 24-hour fluid volume is calculated: 4 mL × TBSA (%) × weight (kg) = 4 mL × 36 × 80 kg = 11,520 mL. The first half of this volume (11,520 mL / 2 = 5,760 mL) is to be infused over the first 8 hours from the time of the injury. Since the injury occurred at 0800 and it is now 1000, 2 hours have passed. Therefore, this 5,760 mL must be infused over the remaining 6 hours (8 hours - 2 hours). The initial infusion rate is therefore 5,760 mL / 6 hours = 960 mL/hr. This rapid infusion is crucial to combat burn shock, which results from massive fluid shifts and hypovolemia due to increased capillary permeability at the burn site.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect responses result from mathematical errors, miscalculation of the TBSA, or misunderstanding the principles of the Parkland formula. Common errors include using an incorrect multiplier (e.g., 2 mL or 3 mL instead of 4 mL), miscalculating the volume for the first half, or failing to adjust the infusion rate based on the time elapsed since the injury occurred. For instance, calculating the rate over the full 8 hours instead of the remaining 6 hours is a critical mistake that would lead to under-resuscitation. Under-resuscitation can lead to acute kidney injury, hypovolemic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. Over-resuscitation can lead to pulmonary edema and abdominal compartment syndrome.",
