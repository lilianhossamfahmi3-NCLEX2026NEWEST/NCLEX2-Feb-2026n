Calcium gluconate is administered to counteract the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia by stabilizing the cardiac cell membrane.

Administering IV regular insulin and 50% dextrose facilitates the rapid movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. The dextrose is essential to prevent hypoglycemia."

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is given to increase urine output, thereby eliminating potassium and addressing the client's fluid overload (evidenced by crackles and edema). This is done after stabilizing the cardiac membrane and initiating potassium shifting."

Hemodialysis is the most effective treatment for severe AKI with complications like hyperkalemia and significant fluid overload that are refractory to medical management. This requires coordination and time to set up, so it is initiated after immediate life-saving interventions have been performed."
