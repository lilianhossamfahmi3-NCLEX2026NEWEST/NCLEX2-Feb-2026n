The client has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and the nephrologist has just provided a new set of orders.

        "id": "opt-2",
        "rationale": "Placing the client on a continuous cardiac monitor is the highest priority due to the elevated potassium level of 5.9 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and ultimately ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and intervention for any EKG changes. Clinical Pearl: Always prioritize cardiac monitoring in hyperkalemia.",
        "pathophysiology": "Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, making them more excitable and prone to dysrhythmias. This is due to the altered ratio of intracellular to extracellular potassium, affecting the repolarization phase of the action potential."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt-4",
        "rationale": "Administering calcium gluconate is the next priority. Calcium gluconate does not lower the potassium level but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart by raising the threshold potential, thereby stabilizing the cardiac cell membrane and reducing the risk of dysrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardiac protection but is not a long-term solution for hyperkalemia.",
        "pathophysiology": "Calcium gluconate increases the concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid, which counteracts the effect of hyperkalemia on the cell membrane excitability. This helps to restore the normal gradient between the resting membrane potential and the threshold potential."

      {
        "id": "opt-1",
        "rationale": "Administering regular insulin and 50% dextrose IV push is crucial to shift potassium from the extracellular space back into the intracellular space. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium pump, which actively transports potassium into cells. Dextrose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells along with potassium. Clinical Pearl: Monitor blood glucose levels closely after administering insulin and dextrose.",
        "pathophysiology": "Insulin binds to insulin receptors on cell membranes, activating the sodium-potassium pump. This pump moves potassium ions into the cell in exchange for sodium ions, effectively lowering the serum potassium level. Dextrose prevents hypoglycemia by providing glucose for the cells to use as fuel."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt-5",
        "rationale": "Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes potassium excretion by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle in the kidneys. This increased sodium delivery to the distal tubule enhances potassium secretion. Furosemide also helps to reduce fluid overload, as evidenced by the client's crackles and edema. Clinical Pearl: Monitor fluid balance and potassium levels closely when administering furosemide.",
        "pathophysiology": "Furosemide blocks the Na-K-2Cl symporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, preventing the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride. This leads to increased excretion of these electrolytes and water in the urine."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt-3",
        "rationale": "Consulting with the charge nurse to coordinate urgent hemodialysis is the final step. Hemodialysis is the most effective method for removing potassium and excess fluid from the body in clients with severe AKI and hyperkalemia that is unresponsive to medical management. This requires coordination and preparation, making it the last step after stabilizing the client and initiating other interventions. Clinical Pearl: Hemodialysis is indicated for severe hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and metabolic acidosis in AKI.",
        "pathophysiology": "Hemodialysis uses a semipermeable membrane to filter blood, removing excess electrolytes, waste products, and fluid. Blood is pumped from the client's body through the dialyzer, where it is exposed to a dialysate solution that contains a lower concentration of potassium and other waste products. These substances diffuse from the blood into the dialysate, effectively lowering their concentration in the blood."
