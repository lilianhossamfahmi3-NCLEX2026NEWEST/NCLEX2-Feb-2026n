    "scenario": "A 48-year-old construction worker is on the orthopedic unit 8 hours after an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a comminuted fracture of the right tibia and fibula. The client's lower leg is in a bulky dressing and a posterior splint. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine is in use. The nurse enters the room and finds the client visibly distressed. The client states, \"This pain is a 10/10, it's a deep, burning feeling, and the morphine isn't touching it.\" The nurse notes multiple PCA attempts within the last hour. Assessment reveals the right foot is cool and pale, with a capillary refill of 4 seconds. The client reports a \"pins and needles\" sensation in their toes. Distal pulses are faint via Doppler. When the nurse gently performs passive dorsiflexion of the toes, the client cries out in severe pain.",
    "question": "The nurse suspects the client is developing acute compartment syndrome. Which assessment findings are consistent with this complication? Select all that apply.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Pain that is out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by standard analgesia is the earliest and most important sign of acute compartment syndrome. This occurs because the increased pressure within the fascial compartment compromises blood flow, leading to muscle ischemia and nerve irritation, which causes severe pain that does not respond to opioids."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Purulent drainage is a sign of a wound infection. While a potential postoperative complication, it is not a characteristic finding of acute compartment syndrome. Furthermore, an infection is unlikely to manifest with purulent drainage only 8 hours after surgery."

        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Paresthesia (numbness, tingling, or a 'pins and needles' sensation) is another early indicator of compartment syndrome. It results from nerve compression and ischemia as the pressure within the compartment rises, affecting sensory nerve function before motor function."

        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "A bounding pulse is the opposite of what is expected in compartment syndrome. As intracompartmental pressure rises, it compresses blood vessels, leading to diminished (weak, thready) and eventually absent distal pulses. A bounding pulse would suggest increased blood flow, not a vascular compromise from compression."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Pallor (paleness) and coolness of the extremity are later signs of compartment syndrome that indicate significant arterial compromise. The escalating pressure within the compartment exceeds arterial pressure, reducing or obstructing blood flow and causing the limb to become pale and cool to the touch."

        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Pain on passive stretch of the muscles within the affected compartment is a highly specific and reliable sign of compartment syndrome. The stretching of ischemic muscles elicits excruciating pain. In this case, dorsiflexion of the toes stretches the muscles in the posterior compartment of the lower leg."
        },
        "opt_7": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Localized warmth and erythema (redness) over the calf are classic signs of an inflammatory process, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or cellulitis. In contrast, compartment syndrome is an ischemic process, which leads to coolness and pallor due to decreased arterial perfusion."
        },
        "opt_8": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "A tense, swollen, and firm-to-palpation extremity is a direct result of the underlying pathophysiology: increased fluid (edema or blood) trapped within the inelastic fascial compartment. This pressure is what causes all other signs and symptoms of neurovascular compromise."
