The client received cefazolin 2g IV intraoperatively as a prophylactic antibiotic. The client is now awake and alert. Upon initial assessment, the nurse is called to the bedside by the client who states, \"I feel like I have a lump in my throat and my skin is so itchy.\" The nurse notes diffuse urticaria across the client's chest and neck."

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "A": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. It is a non-selective adrenergic agonist. The alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and reducing mucosal edema. The beta-1 adrenergic effects increase heart rate and contractility. The beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, opening the airways. Clinical Pearl: Administer epinephrine IM in the mid-outer thigh. Repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed. Monitor for adverse effects such as tachycardia and hypertension.",
      "pathophysiology": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction characterized by rapid onset and potentially fatal airway, breathing, and circulation compromise. It is triggered by the release of mast cell and basophil mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, and leukotrienes, in response to an allergen. These mediators cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus production, leading to hypotension, edema, and respiratory distress."
    },
    "B": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Anaphylactic shock causes massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to intravascular fluid loss and hypotension. Rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride helps to restore circulating volume and improve blood pressure. Clinical Pearl: Use a large-bore IV catheter (18 gauge or larger) for rapid fluid administration. Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as crackles in the lungs and jugular venous distension.",
      "pathophysiology": "The vasodilation and increased capillary permeability in anaphylaxis result in a distributive shock state. Fluid shifts from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, leading to hypovolemia and decreased venous return to the heart. This reduces cardiac output and causes hypotension, impairing tissue perfusion."
    },
    "C": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: While airway management is crucial in anaphylaxis, preparing for intubation is not the immediate first action. Epinephrine should be administered first to attempt to reverse airway edema and bronchospasm. Intubation may be necessary if the client does not respond to epinephrine or if respiratory distress worsens.",
      "pathophysiology": "Laryngeal edema and bronchospasm are common manifestations of anaphylaxis. Laryngeal edema can cause upper airway obstruction, leading to stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing. Bronchospasm causes narrowing of the airways, leading to wheezing, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia."
    },
    "D": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Diphenhydramine is an H1-antihistamine that helps to block the effects of histamine, a major mediator released during anaphylaxis. It primarily relieves cutaneous symptoms such as urticaria and pruritus. Clinical Pearl: Diphenhydramine is a second-line treatment and should be administered after epinephrine. It does not reverse airway obstruction or hypotension.",
      "pathophysiology": "Histamine is a potent vasodilator and increases capillary permeability. It also causes bronchoconstriction and stimulates nerve endings, leading to itching and pain. H1-antihistamines block the effects of histamine on H1 receptors, reducing vasodilation, capillary permeability, and itching."
    },
    "E": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: The client's SpO2 is 91% on room air, indicating hypoxemia. Applying high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is essential to improve oxygenation and prevent further respiratory compromise. Clinical Pearl: Monitor the client's SpO2 continuously and adjust the oxygen flow rate as needed to maintain an SpO2 of 94% or higher.",
      "pathophysiology": "Bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and increased mucus production can all contribute to hypoxemia in anaphylaxis. Bronchospasm reduces airflow to the alveoli, while laryngeal edema obstructs the upper airway. Increased mucus production can also block the airways and impair gas exchange."
    },
    "F": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is contraindicated in anaphylactic shock due to hypotension. Sitting upright can cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, further decreasing venous return and worsening hypotension. The client should be placed supine with legs elevated to promote venous return.",
      "pathophysiology": "Hypotension in anaphylaxis is caused by vasodilation and decreased cardiac output. Vasodilation reduces peripheral vascular resistance, while decreased cardiac output is due to hypovolemia and impaired myocardial contractility. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position can exacerbate hypotension by reducing venous return to the heart."
    },
    "G": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist that can help to relieve bronchospasm, but it is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the preferred bronchodilator because it also addresses vasodilation and mucosal edema. Albuterol may be used as an adjunct therapy if bronchospasm persists after epinephrine.",
      "pathophysiology": "Albuterol stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation. This helps to open the airways and improve airflow. However, albuterol does not address the other components of anaphylaxis, such as vasodilation and mucosal edema."
    },
    "H": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: While anaphylaxis can sometimes cause cardiac complications, obtaining an ECG is not a priority in the immediate management of anaphylactic shock. The priority is to stabilize the client's airway, breathing, and circulation with epinephrine, oxygen, and fluids. An ECG may be indicated later if the client develops chest pain or other signs of cardiac ischemia.",
      "pathophysiology": "Anaphylaxis can cause myocardial ischemia (Kounis syndrome) due to mediator release and hypotension. Histamine and other mediators can cause coronary artery spasm and platelet aggregation, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart. Hypotension can also reduce coronary perfusion, contributing to ischemia."
