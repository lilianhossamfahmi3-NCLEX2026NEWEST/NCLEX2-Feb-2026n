    "stem": "A 34-year-old male is admitted to the orthopedic unit 6 hours after an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a comminuted tibial fracture sustained in a crush injury at a construction site. The client's left lower leg is in a rigid splint with an elastic bandage wrap. The client reports severe pain in the affected leg, rating it a '10/10' and describing it as a deep, burning sensation. This pain is unrelieved by two doses of IV morphine administered over the last hour. The nurse assesses the leg and notes it is pale, tense, and visibly swollen. The client also reports new-onset 'pins and needles' sensation in his foot.",

            "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's pain is disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by opioids. This is a classic sign of compartment syndrome, indicating ischemic pain due to compromised tissue perfusion, not just inflammatory or incisional pain. Administering more opioids will not resolve the underlying cause and dangerously delays definitive treatment."

            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The affected limb should be positioned at the level of the heart (neutral position). This position helps maintain arterial perfusion to the limb without increasing hydrostatic pressure that could worsen edema. Elevating the limb above the heart can decrease arterial inflow, exacerbating ischemia."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency. The constellation of signs (unrelieved pain, swelling, tenseness, paresthesia) strongly suggests this diagnosis. The nurse's highest priority is to immediately notify the HCP to facilitate prompt intervention, such as a fasciotomy, which is necessary to prevent permanent neurovascular damage and muscle death."

            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Applying cold causes vasoconstriction, which will further decrease arterial blood flow to the already compromised tissues. In a state of ischemia, any further reduction in perfusion is contraindicated and can accelerate tissue damage."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While elevation is appropriate for typical post-operative edema, it is contraindicated in suspected compartment syndrome. Elevating the limb above the heart level lowers the arterial pressure gradient, further impairing circulation and worsening ischemia in the compromised compartment."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The external compression from the tight elastic bandage wrap is contributing to the increased pressure within the fascial compartment. Loosening or removing any restrictive dressings, splints, or casts is a critical first step to decrease external pressure and potentially improve perfusion while awaiting further orders from the HCP."
