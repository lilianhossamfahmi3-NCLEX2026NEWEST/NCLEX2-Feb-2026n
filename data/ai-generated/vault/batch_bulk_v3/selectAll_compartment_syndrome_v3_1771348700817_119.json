      "Situation": "34-year-old male, 6 hours post-ORIF for comminuted tibial fracture from a crush injury. Severe, unrelieved pain (10/10) in left lower leg.",
      "Background": "Leg in rigid splint with elastic bandage. Received two doses IV morphine in the last hour with no pain relief. Injury sustained at a construction site.",
      "Assessment": "Leg is pale, tense, and visibly swollen. Reports new-onset 'pins and needles' sensation in foot. Pain described as deep, burning.",
      "Recommendation": "Suspect compartment syndrome. Immediate actions needed: loosen bandage, position leg at heart level, notify HCP STAT."

  "stem": "A 34-year-old male is admitted to the orthopedic unit 6 hours after an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a comminuted tibial fracture sustained in a crush injury at a construction site. The client's left lower leg is in a rigid splint with an elastic bandage wrap. The client reports severe pain in the affected leg, rating it a '10/10' and describing it as a deep, burning sensation. This pain is unrelieved by two doses of IV morphine administered over the last hour. The nurse assesses the leg and notes it is pale, tense, and visibly swollen. The client also reports new-onset 'pins and needles' sensation in his foot.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's pain is disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by opioids, suggesting compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling and pressure within a confined muscle compartment (in this case, the lower leg) compromises the circulation and nerve function within that space. The increased pressure reduces capillary perfusion below a level necessary for tissue viability. This leads to ischemia, causing severe pain, paresthesia, and potentially irreversible muscle and nerve damage if not treated promptly. Opioids will mask the symptoms without addressing the underlying problem. Clinical Pearl: Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome.",
      "scoring": "-"
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Positioning the affected limb at the level of the heart (neutral position) is crucial. This position optimizes arterial perfusion to the limb without increasing hydrostatic pressure, which could worsen edema. Elevating the limb above the heart can decrease arterial inflow, exacerbating ischemia. Conversely, keeping the limb dependent increases hydrostatic pressure and swelling. Clinical Pearl: Avoid elevation above the heart in suspected compartment syndrome to maintain arterial perfusion.",
      "scoring": "+"
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_3",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent permanent damage. The '6 Ps' (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, poikilothermia) are classic signs, although not all may be present. The nurse's highest priority is to immediately notify the HCP to facilitate prompt intervention, such as a fasciotomy. A fasciotomy involves surgically incising the fascia to relieve pressure and restore blood flow to the affected compartment. Delaying treatment can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis, nerve damage, amputation, or even death. Clinical Pearl: Early recognition and prompt notification of the HCP are critical in managing compartment syndrome.",
      "scoring": "+"
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_4",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Applying cold causes vasoconstriction, which will further decrease arterial blood flow to the already compromised tissues. In a state of ischemia, any further reduction in perfusion is contraindicated and can accelerate tissue damage. While cold therapy is appropriate for reducing inflammation in other musculoskeletal injuries, it is harmful in compartment syndrome. Clinical Pearl: Avoid cold compresses in suspected compartment syndrome as they can worsen ischemia.",
      "scoring": "-"
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_5",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While elevation is appropriate for typical post-operative edema, it is contraindicated in suspected compartment syndrome. Elevating the limb above the heart level lowers the arterial pressure gradient, further impairing circulation and worsening ischemia in the compromised compartment. The goal is to maintain adequate arterial inflow to the affected tissues. Clinical Pearl: Do not elevate the limb above the heart in suspected compartment syndrome.",
      "scoring": "-"
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_6",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The external compression from the tight elastic bandage wrap is contributing to the increased pressure within the fascial compartment. Loosening or removing any restrictive dressings, splints, or casts is a critical first step to decrease external pressure and potentially improve perfusion while awaiting further orders from the HCP. This action can help alleviate some of the pressure and potentially improve blood flow to the affected tissues. Clinical Pearl: Immediately loosen or remove any constricting bandages or casts in suspected compartment syndrome.",
