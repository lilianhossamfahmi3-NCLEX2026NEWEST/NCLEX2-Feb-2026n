In a hypertensive crisis, the therapeutic goal is to lower the MAP by no more than 10-20% in the first hour, and then by another 5-15% over the next 23 hours. A precipitous drop can lead to hypoperfusion of vital organs (brain, heart, kidneys), causing ischemic injury. The client's MAP dropped from 161 mmHg at 1400 to 122 mmHg at 1500, a decrease of approximately 24% in one hour. This excessive reduction is likely causing the client's new symptoms of severe dizziness and decreased urine output, which are signs of cerebral and renal hypoperfusion, respectively. This requires immediate intervention, such as decreasing the nicardipine infusion rate.",

The gradual decrease in heart rate is an expected physiological response to a drop in blood pressure and a potential pharmacologic effect of nicardipine; it is not alarming. The improvement in the client's headache is a positive therapeutic outcome, indicating that the initial treatment is effectively reducing intracranial pressure, and is not a cause for concern.",
