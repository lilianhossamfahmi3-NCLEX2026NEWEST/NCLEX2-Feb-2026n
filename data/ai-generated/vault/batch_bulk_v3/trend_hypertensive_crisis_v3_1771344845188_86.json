The goal is to reduce MAP by no more than 10-20% in the first hour, followed by a further 5-15% over the next 23 hours. A precipitous drop can cause cerebral, cardiac, and renal ischemia. The client's MAP decreased from 161 mmHg at 1400 to 122 mmHg at 1500, a 24% reduction in one hour. This excessive reduction likely causes dizziness and decreased urine output, indicating cerebral and renal hypoperfusion. Immediate intervention, such as decreasing the nicardipine infusion rate, is needed.",
