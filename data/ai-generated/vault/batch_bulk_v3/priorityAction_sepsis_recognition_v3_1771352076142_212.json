    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 77-year-old male client admitted 2 days ago for a complicated urinary tract infection from an indwelling catheter. The client has a history of type 2 diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The nurse performs an assessment and notes the client is more lethargic than on the previous shift.\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n- Temperature: 38.6° C (101.5° F)\n- Heart Rate: 118 beats/minute\n- Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/minute\n- Blood Pressure: 92/56 mmHg\n- Oxygen Saturation: 91% on room air\n- Mental Status: Slow to respond to questions, oriented to person only\n- Urine Output: 45 mL in the last 2 hours\n\nWhich action should the nurse take **first**?",

        "questionRationale": "The client is exhibiting multiple signs of septic shock, a life-threatening condition characterized by persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg. The clinical cues include hypotension (92/56 mmHg), tachycardia (118/min), tachypnea (24/min), fever (38.6°C), altered mental status (lethargy), and signs of organ dysfunction (hypoxia with SpO2 of 91% and oliguria with low urine output). The priority action must address the most immediate threat to life, which is circulatory collapse due to distributive shock. According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (Hour-1 Bundle), rapid fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of initial management to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion.",

                "rationale": "Correct. This is the priority action. The client's hypotension (MAP of 68 mmHg, but trending down and symptomatic) and tachycardia are signs of significant intravascular fluid deficit and vasodilation. Immediate, aggressive fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid like 0.9% sodium chloride is essential to restore circulating volume, increase blood pressure, and improve organ perfusion. This action directly addresses the life-threatening circulatory collapse.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. Obtaining blood cultures is a critical step in the sepsis bundle to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. However, it does not correct the immediate life-threatening problem of hemodynamic instability. While cultures should be drawn before antibiotics are administered, stabilizing the circulation with fluid resuscitation takes priority when the patient is in shock.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. While the fever contributes to tachycardia and increased metabolic demand, it is a symptom of the underlying infection and not the primary cause of the client's instability. Administering an antipyretic is an appropriate intervention but does not address the life-threatening issue of hypoperfusion and hypotension. Stabilizing circulation is a higher priority.",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's oxygen saturation of 91% indicates hypoxia and is a sign of organ dysfunction. Applying oxygen is an important intervention to improve tissue oxygenation. However, the root cause of the poor tissue oxygenation is inadequate perfusion from circulatory collapse. Without adequate blood pressure and cardiac output (which fluid resuscitation addresses), supplemental oxygen will not be effectively delivered to the tissues. Therefore, restoring volume is the priority over supplementing oxygen, although these actions may occur nearly simultaneously.",

Placing a client in a modified Trendelenburg position (legs elevated) can provide a transient increase in blood pressure by promoting venous return from the lower extremities. However, this is a temporary measure and is not a substitute for definitive treatment with fluid resuscitation. It does not address the underlying intravascular volume deficit and can increase the work of breathing, which may be detrimental for a client who is already tachypneic.",
