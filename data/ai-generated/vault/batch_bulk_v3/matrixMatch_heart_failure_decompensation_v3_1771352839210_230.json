                "rationale": "Correct. Bibasilar crackles are caused by the movement of air through fluid-filled alveoli. In left-sided heart failure, the failing left ventricle cannot effectively pump blood forward, causing a backup of blood into the pulmonary circulation. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, forcing fluid into the interstitial space and alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema."

The failing right ventricle cannot effectively pump blood into the lungs, causing blood to back up in the systemic venous circulation. This increases capillary hydrostatic pressure in the periphery, leading to fluid shifting into the interstitial tissue of dependent areas like the legs and ankles."

An S3 heart sound ('ventricular gallop') is an early diastolic sound caused by the rapid rush of a large volume of blood into a non-compliant, distended ventricle.

The body compensates by shunting blood from the extremities to vital organs."
