        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes client safety, legal requirements, and procedural readiness. The first step is always to ensure legal and ethical obligations are met by verifying informed consent. Next, establishing a comprehensive baseline (vital signs, weight, abdominal girth) is critical for evaluating the procedure's effectiveness and detecting potential complications, such as hypovolemic shock. Immediately following baseline data collection, having the client void is a crucial safety measure to prevent accidental bladder perforation during needle insertion. Once the client is prepared, proper positioning facilitates fluid drainage by gravity and eases respiratory effort. Finally, with the client prepared and positioned, the nurse can set up the sterile field and equipment for the provider to begin the procedure.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence compromises client safety or procedural efficiency. For example, positioning the client or setting up the sterile tray before verifying consent is a violation of patient rights and a serious medical-legal error. Failing to have the client void before the procedure creates a significant risk of bladder injury. Obtaining baseline measurements after the procedure has started would make it impossible to accurately assess for changes and complications. The sequence is dictated by a logical flow from legal prerequisites to patient preparation, safety measures, and finally, equipment setup.",
