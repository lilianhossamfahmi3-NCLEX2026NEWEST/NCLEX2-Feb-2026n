  "text": "The client is a 28-year-old male admitted from the emergency department for an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The client has a history of medication non-adherence. He is pacing the hallway and clenching his fists. When asked why he is upset, he states, 'The whispers are telling me that the man in room 204 is a demon who must be destroyed.' His speech is tangential with loose associations. The client's record indicates a past assault on a staff member during a previous admission. He is refusing his scheduled olanzapine, claiming it is poison. Vital signs are within normal limits.",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate an immediate risk of violence. Pacing and clenched fists are nonverbal cues of escalating agitation. Command hallucinations directing harm to others ('destroy the demon') are a psychiatric emergency. A history of assault is the strongest predictor of future violence. Refusal of medication due to paranoid delusions (poison) exacerbates the psychosis and prevents symptom control. These factors necessitate immediate interventions to ensure the safety of the client and others.",
    "incorrect": "While medication non-adherence and disorganized speech are important aspects of schizophrenia, they do not represent the same level of immediate danger as the highlighted findings. Normal vital signs are reassuring but do not negate the acute psychiatric risk.",
