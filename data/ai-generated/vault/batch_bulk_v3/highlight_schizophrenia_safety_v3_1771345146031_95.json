    "text": "The client is a 28-year-old male admitted from the emergency department for an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The client has a history of medication non-adherence. He is pacing the hallway and clenching his fists. When asked why he is upset, he states, 'The whispers are telling me that the man in room 204 is a demon who must be destroyed.' His speech is tangential with loose associations. The client's record indicates a past assault on a staff member during a previous admission. He is refusing his scheduled olanzapine, claiming it is poison. Vital signs are within normal limits.",

These cues collectively indicate an imminent and high risk for other-directed violence, requiring immediate safety interventions such as one-to-one observation, potential seclusion or restraint, and therapeutic communication to de-escalate the situation.",
        "incorrect": "While a history of non-adherence and disorganized speech are characteristic of schizophrenia, they do not signify the same level of immediate danger as direct threats, agitation, and a history of actual violence. Normal vital signs, while important to note, do not provide information about the client's immediate psychiatric safety risk in this context.",
