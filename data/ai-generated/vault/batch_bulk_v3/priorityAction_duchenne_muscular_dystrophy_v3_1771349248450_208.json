The somnolence is a critical sign of hypercapnia (CO2 retention), which is a life-threatening emergency. The immediate priority is to support ventilation. BiPAP provides non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, which decreases the work of breathing, improves alveolar ventilation to blow off excess CO2, and corrects hypoxemia. This is the most direct and life-saving intervention.",

Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is helpful but insufficient for the degree of respiratory muscle fatigue. Obtaining a chest x-ray is a diagnostic measure that delays the critical intervention needed to support breathing. Administering albuterol is inappropriate as the cause of respiratory distress is muscle weakness, not bronchoconstriction.",
