    "correct": "Initiating BiPAP is the priority. The client exhibits signs of acute respiratory failure: lethargy, rapid shallow respirations, hypoxemia (SpO2 90%), and accessory muscle use. These indicate hypercapnia and impending respiratory collapse. DMD causes progressive muscle weakness, including respiratory muscles. A 'mild cold' can exacerbate respiratory compromise. BiPAP provides non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, supporting weakened respiratory muscles, improving alveolar ventilation to expel CO2, and increasing oxygenation. This prevents intubation and respiratory arrest. ClinicalPearl: In DMD, even minor respiratory infections can trigger rapid decompensation.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options do not address the immediate threat of respiratory failure. High-Fowler's position (A) can aid lung expansion but is insufficient for this client's severe respiratory compromise. A chest x-ray (B) is diagnostic but delays critical intervention. Albuterol (D) is a bronchodilator, ineffective for respiratory muscle weakness.",
