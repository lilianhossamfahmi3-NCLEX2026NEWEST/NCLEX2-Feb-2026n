The non-contrast CT scan was negative for hemorrhage. Vital signs are: BP 148/88 mmHg, HR 75/min, RR 18/min. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select 4.",

            "opt_01": "Correct. Alteplase dosage is weight-based (typically 0.9 mg/kg, not to exceed 90 mg). Accurate weight is critical to ensure a therapeutic dose and minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications from overdosing. This is a crucial safety check before administration.",
            "opt_02": "Incorrect. Prophylactic administration of an antiemetic is not a standard part of the alteplase protocol. While nausea and vomiting can occur, medication is typically administered if symptoms develop, not preventatively. The priority actions relate to safe medication administration and monitoring.",
            "opt_03": "Correct. A second IV line is a safety essential. One line is dedicated to the alteplase infusion. The second line provides reliable access for administering other necessary IV medications (e.g., antihypertensives) or fluids without interrupting the critical thrombolytic infusion. All invasive line placements should be completed *before* starting alteplase to minimize bleeding risk.",
            "opt_04": "Incorrect. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is an invasive procedure that increases the risk of bleeding from the urethra. It should be avoided after alteplase administration has begun. If deemed absolutely necessary, it should have been placed before the decision to administer alteplase was finalized.",
            "opt_05": "Correct. A baseline neurological assessment, often using a standardized tool like the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is essential. This baseline allows the nurse to accurately monitor for signs of clinical improvement or deterioration, such as a change in level of consciousness or new focal deficits, which could indicate an intracranial hemorrhage.",
            "opt_06": "Incorrect. This action is a serious contraindication and could cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Anticoagulants (like enoxaparin) and antiplatelet agents are withheld for at least 24 hours after alteplase administration due to the synergistic effect and profoundly increased risk of bleeding.",
            "opt_07": "Correct. This describes the standard, evidence-based protocol for administering alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. 10% of the total calculated dose is given as an IV bolus over one minute, followed by the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes. Adherence to this protocol is vital for efficacy and safety.",
            "opt_08": "Incorrect. Current guidelines state that alteplase can be administered if the blood pressure is below 185/110 mmHg. The client's BP of 148/88 mmHg is well within this acceptable range. Delaying the administration of this time-sensitive medication is not indicated and would be detrimental to client outcomes, as 'time is brain'."
