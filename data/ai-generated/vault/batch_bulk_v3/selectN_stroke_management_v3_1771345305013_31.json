        "rationale": "Correct. Alteplase dosage is weight-based (typically 0.9 mg/kg, not to exceed 90 mg). Accurate weight is critical to ensure a therapeutic dose and minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications from overdosing. This is a crucial safety check before administration.  \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase converts plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. Overdosing can lead to systemic fibrinolysis, increasing the risk of bleeding.  \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use a calibrated scale to obtain the most accurate weight possible. Double-check the calculated dose with another nurse or pharmacist.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Prophylactic administration of an antiemetic is not a standard part of the alteplase protocol. While nausea and vomiting can occur, medication is typically administered if symptoms develop, not preventatively. The priority actions relate to safe medication administration and monitoring. The risk of aspiration should be considered, but routine antiemetics are not indicated. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Nausea and vomiting are not direct effects of alteplase but can occur due to increased intracranial pressure or other stroke-related symptoms. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of nausea and vomiting and administer antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) as needed.",

        "rationale": "Correct. A second IV line is a safety essential. One line is dedicated to the alteplase infusion. The second line provides reliable access for administering other necessary IV medications (e.g., antihypertensives) or fluids without interrupting the critical thrombolytic infusion. All invasive line placements should be completed *before* starting alteplase to minimize bleeding risk. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase increases the risk of bleeding. Having a dedicated line for alteplase and another for other medications avoids unnecessary venipunctures and potential bleeding complications. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Ensure both IV lines are patent and have good blood return before initiating alteplase. Use a large-bore catheter (18 gauge or larger) for optimal infusion rates.",

      "opt_04": {
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is an invasive procedure that increases the risk of bleeding from the urethra. It should be avoided after alteplase administration has begun. If deemed absolutely necessary, it should have been placed before the decision to administer alteplase was finalized. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase-induced fibrinolysis increases the risk of bleeding at any site. Invasive procedures should be minimized to reduce this risk. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** If urinary retention is suspected, consider intermittent catheterization instead of an indwelling catheter to minimize bleeding risk.",

        "rationale": "Correct. A baseline neurological assessment, often using a standardized tool like the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is essential. This baseline allows the nurse to accurately monitor for signs of clinical improvement or deterioration, such as a change in level of consciousness or new focal deficits, which could indicate an intracranial hemorrhage. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** The NIHSS assesses various neurological functions affected by stroke, including level of consciousness, language, motor function, and sensory perception. Changes in these functions can indicate worsening ischemia or hemorrhage. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Perform the NIHSS consistently and accurately. Document the score and specific findings in detail. Communicate any changes in neurological status to the physician immediately.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is a serious contraindication and could cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Anticoagulants (like enoxaparin) and antiplatelet agents are withheld for at least 24 hours after alteplase administration due to the synergistic effect and profoundly increased risk of bleeding. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Alteplase and enoxaparin both inhibit clot formation through different mechanisms. Combining them significantly increases the risk of systemic bleeding. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Carefully review the client's medication list and ensure that no anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents are administered concurrently with alteplase.",

This describes the standard, evidence-based protocol for administering alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. 10% of the total calculated dose is given as an IV bolus over one minute, followed by the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes. Adherence to this protocol is vital for efficacy and safety. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** The bolus dose helps to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels of alteplase in the bloodstream. The subsequent infusion maintains these levels for sustained thrombolysis. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use an infusion pump to ensure accurate and controlled administration of alteplase. Closely monitor the client for any signs of adverse reactions during and after the infusion.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Current guidelines state that alteplase can be administered if the blood pressure is below 185/110 mmHg. The client's BP of 148/88 mmHg is well within this acceptable range. Delaying the administration of this time-sensitive medication is not indicated and would be detrimental to client outcomes, as 'time is brain'. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis. However, excessively low blood pressure can compromise cerebral perfusion. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood pressure closely before, during, and after alteplase administration. If blood pressure exceeds 185/110 mmHg, administer antihypertensive medications as prescribed to lower it to an acceptable range before initiating alteplase.",
