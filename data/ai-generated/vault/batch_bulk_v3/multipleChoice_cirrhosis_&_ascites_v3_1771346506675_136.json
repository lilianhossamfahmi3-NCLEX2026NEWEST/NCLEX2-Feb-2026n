    "stem": "The nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client with end-stage cirrhosis and severe ascites. The nurse notes the following assessment findings: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 108 bpm, blood pressure 96/60 mmHg, abdominal tenderness on palpation, and new-onset confusion. Laboratory results show a WBC count of 15,500/mm³. Which complication is the client most likely experiencing?",

    "correct": "The client's presentation strongly suggests Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). Fever (37.9°C), abdominal tenderness, new-onset confusion, and elevated WBC (15,500/mm³) in a client with cirrhosis and ascites are hallmark signs. Ascitic fluid becomes infected due to bacterial translocation from the gut. The compromised liver function impairs the body's ability to fight infection. SBP requires immediate paracentesis for diagnosis and broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent sepsis and death. Delay in treatment significantly increases mortality.",
    "incorrect": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is possible, but the fever and abdominal tenderness point to infection as the primary cause, which can then worsen HE. Hypovolemic shock is less likely as the primary issue; the hypotension is more likely distributive shock secondary to sepsis from SBP. Hepatorenal syndrome lacks key indicators like rising creatinine or oliguria; the focus is on the infection.",

While confusion indicates hepatic encephalopathy, the fever, abdominal tenderness, and elevated WBC count strongly suggest an infectious process (SBP) as the primary driver.
