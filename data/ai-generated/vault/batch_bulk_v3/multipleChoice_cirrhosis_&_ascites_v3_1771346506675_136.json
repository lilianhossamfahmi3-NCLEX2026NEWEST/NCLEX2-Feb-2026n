The nurse notes the following assessment findings: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 108 bpm, blood pressure 96/60 mmHg, abdominal tenderness on palpation, and new-onset confusion. Laboratory results show a WBC count of 15,500/mm³. Which complication is the client most likely experiencing?",

        "correct": "The client's presentation of fever, abdominal tenderness, altered mental status (confusion), and leukocytosis (WBC 15,500/mm³) in the context of cirrhosis and ascites is a classic presentation of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). SBP is a severe infection of the ascitic fluid that requires immediate diagnosis via paracentesis and prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",
        "incorrect": "While the client exhibits signs that are features of the other conditions, the specific cluster of findings points most directly to SBP. Hepatic encephalopathy is present (confusion) but is likely precipitated by the infection. Hypovolemia is suggested by the vital signs, but this is a feature of septic shock secondary to SBP, not the primary diagnosis. Hepatorenal syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion primarily defined by renal failure, for which there is no data provided.",

While new-onset confusion is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the presence of fever, abdominal tenderness, and a significantly elevated WBC count points to an acute infectious process.

The combination of fever (37.9°C), abdominal tenderness, altered mental status, and leukocytosis (WBC 15,500/mm³) in a client with ascites is highly indicative of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP).
