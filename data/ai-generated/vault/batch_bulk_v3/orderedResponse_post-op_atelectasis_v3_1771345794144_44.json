During the morning assessment, the nurse notes the client is guarding his abdomen and is reluctant to move in bed. He reports incisional pain as 7/10. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in the bilateral lower lobes. The nurse determines the client is developing post-operative atelectasis. The client has a PRN order for intravenous morphine sulfate.",

        "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of postoperative atelectasis (low-grade fever, diminished breath sounds, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation) secondary to shallow breathing due to incisional pain. The priority of nursing actions is to first implement immediate, non-invasive measures to improve lung expansion, then address the underlying cause (pain), and finally implement therapeutic interventions, followed by evaluation.",

                "justification": "The first action should be to elevate the head of the bed. This is a quick, independent nursing intervention that immediately facilitates lung expansion by allowing the diaphragm to move down, decreasing pressure on the lungs from abdominal contents. This action improves the effectiveness of all subsequent respiratory interventions."

                "rank": 2,
                "justification": "The second action is to administer the prescribed analgesic. The client's significant pain (7/10) is the primary reason for shallow breathing and the inability to participate in pulmonary hygiene. Effective pain management is critical before asking the client to perform deep breathing and coughing exercises, which can be very painful."

                "rank": 3,
                "justification": "The third action is to coach the client on using the incentive spirometer. This should be done after the pain medication has had time to take effect (typically 15-30 minutes for IV morphine). With pain controlled, the client can achieve a maximal deep inhalation, which is necessary for the incentive spirometer to be effective in recruiting and opening collapsed alveoli."

                "rank": 4,
                "justification": "The fourth action is to instruct and assist with splinting while coughing. This intervention complements incentive spirometry by helping to mobilize secretions from the airways that may have accumulated in the atelectatic areas. Splinting the incision with a pillow provides support and significantly reduces pain during the forceful expiratory effort of a cough, making it more effective."

                "rank": 5,
                "justification": "The final action is to reassess the client's breath sounds and respiratory effort. This is the evaluation step of the nursing process. After all interventions have been implemented, the nurse must assess their effectiveness by determining if there is an improvement in air movement in the lung bases and an easing of the work of breathing."
