During the morning assessment, the nurse notes the client is guarding his abdomen and is reluctant to move in bed. He reports incisional pain as 7/10. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in the bilateral lower lobes. The nurse determines the client is developing post-operative atelectasis. The client has a PRN order for intravenous morphine sulfate.",

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of postoperative atelectasis (low-grade fever, diminished breath sounds, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation) secondary to shallow breathing due to incisional pain. Postoperative atelectasis occurs when alveoli collapse due to hypoventilation, often related to pain, anesthesia, and immobility. This leads to decreased gas exchange and potential hypoxemia. The priority of nursing actions is to first implement immediate, non-invasive measures to improve lung expansion, then address the underlying cause (pain), and finally implement therapeutic interventions, followed by evaluation.",

      {
        "option": "opt_3",
        "rank": 1,
        "correct": true,
        "justification": "The first action should be to elevate the head of the bed to at least 45 degrees (Fowler's position). This is a quick, independent nursing intervention that immediately facilitates lung expansion by allowing the diaphragm to move down, decreasing pressure on the lungs from abdominal contents. Fowler's position promotes optimal lung inflation and improves ventilation-perfusion matching. This action improves the effectiveness of all subsequent respiratory interventions."

      {
        "option": "opt_1",
        "rank": 2,
        "correct": true,
        "justification": "The second action is to administer the prescribed analgesic. The client's significant pain (7/10) is the primary reason for shallow breathing and the inability to participate in pulmonary hygiene. Pain inhibits deep breathing and coughing by causing muscle splinting and anxiety. Effective pain management is critical before asking the client to perform deep breathing and coughing exercises, which can be very painful. Intravenous morphine sulfate will reduce pain, allowing for improved respiratory effort."

      {
        "option": "opt_4",
        "rank": 3,
        "correct": true,
        "justification": "The third action is to coach the client on using the incentive spirometer. This should be done after the pain medication has had time to take effect (typically 15-30 minutes for IV morphine). With pain controlled, the client can achieve a maximal deep inhalation, which is necessary for the incentive spirometer to be effective in recruiting and opening collapsed alveoli. Incentive spirometry encourages sustained maximal inspiration, increasing transpulmonary pressure and preventing alveolar collapse."

        "option": "opt_5",
        "rank": 4,
        "correct": true,
        "justification": "The fourth action is to instruct and assist with splinting while coughing. This intervention complements incentive spirometry by helping to mobilize secretions from the airways that may have accumulated in the atelectatic areas. Splinting the incision with a pillow provides support and significantly reduces pain during the forceful expiratory effort of a cough, making it more effective. Coughing helps to clear mucus and debris from the airways, further improving gas exchange."

      {
        "option": "opt_2",
        "rank": 5,
        "correct": true,
        "justification": "The final action is to reassess the client's breath sounds and respiratory effort. This is the evaluation step of the nursing process. After all interventions have been implemented, the nurse must assess their effectiveness by determining if there is an improvement in air movement in the lung bases and an easing of the work of breathing. Improved breath sounds, decreased respiratory rate, and increased oxygen saturation indicate successful interventions."

    "Postoperative atelectasis is a common complication, especially in patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions or those undergoing abdominal surgery. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, chronic lung disease, and prolonged anesthesia.",
    "Effective pain management is crucial for promoting deep breathing and coughing exercises. Use a pain scale to assess pain and administer analgesics as prescribed.",
    "Early mobilization and pulmonary hygiene interventions can prevent or minimize atelectasis. Encourage ambulation as tolerated.",
    "Splinting the incision during coughing reduces pain and improves the effectiveness of the cough. Use a pillow or folded towel to support the incision.",
    "Reassessment after interventions is essential to evaluate their effectiveness. Monitor breath sounds, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and pain level. Report any worsening of respiratory status to the healthcare provider."
