        "rationale": "Correct: The client exhibits signs of myxedema coma, a severe form of hypothyroidism characterized by decreased mental status, hypothermia, and respiratory depression. IV levothyroxine is crucial for rapid thyroid hormone replacement, bypassing potential absorption issues due to slowed GI motility. Levothyroxine increases metabolic rate, improving cellular function.",
        "clinicalPearls": "IV Levothyroxine is preferred over oral in myxedema coma due to unpredictable GI absorption. Monitor for signs of hyperthyroidism (tachycardia, anxiety) as thyroid hormone levels increase."

      {
        "option": "opt_02",
        "rationale": "Correct: Myxedema coma causes significant bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. Initiating thyroid hormone replacement increases myocardial oxygen demand, potentially leading to dysrhythmias or angina. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection and management of these complications. Bradycardia can worsen with even slight increases in metabolic demand.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias during levothyroxine administration. Have emergency medications (e.g., atropine) readily available."

        "option": "opt_06",
        "rationale": "Correct: Myxedema coma often leads to respiratory depression, hypoventilation, and CO2 retention. The client's lethargy and altered mental status further compromise airway protection. Preparing for endotracheal intubation ensures a secure airway and adequate ventilation if the client's respiratory status deteriorates. The shallow respirations and decreased oxygen saturation indicate respiratory compromise.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect: While the client is hypothermic (35.8°C/96.4°F), active rewarming with warming blankets is contraindicated. Rapid peripheral vasodilation can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse. Passive rewarming with blankets and a warm environment is the appropriate approach. The body's compensatory mechanisms are already compromised.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor blood pressure closely during rewarming. Avoid rapid temperature increases."

        "option": "opt_04",
        "rationale": "Incorrect: The hyponatremia (129 mEq/L) in myxedema is typically dilutional, resulting from impaired water excretion due to decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion. Encouraging oral fluid intake will worsen the hyponatremia. Fluid restriction is the appropriate intervention to allow the kidneys to reabsorb sodium. ADH secretion may also be increased, contributing to water retention.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor sodium levels closely. Severe hyponatremia can lead to seizures and further neurological compromise."

      {
        "option": "opt_05",
        "rationale": "Incorrect: Administering sedatives like lorazepam is extremely dangerous in a client with severe hypothyroidism. Their metabolism is significantly slowed, leading to profound and prolonged sedation, potentially precipitating respiratory failure and deepening the comatose state. The client's already compromised respiratory status makes them highly susceptible to the depressant effects of benzodiazepines.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Avoid sedatives and narcotics in clients with myxedema coma. If sedation is absolutely necessary, use the lowest possible dose and monitor respiratory status very closely."
