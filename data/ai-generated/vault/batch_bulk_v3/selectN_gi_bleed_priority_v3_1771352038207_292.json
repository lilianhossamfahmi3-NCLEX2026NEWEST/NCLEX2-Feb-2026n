        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea) due to an acute upper GI bleed. The immediate priorities are to restore intravascular volume, stabilize the bleeding site, monitor for complications, and prepare for blood product replacement. Establishing large-bore IV access is critical for rapid fluid and blood administration. Administering an IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like pantoprazole helps to decrease gastric acid and promote clot stability. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential because hypovolemia and electrolyte shifts can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Preparing for a transfusion is a key step in replacing lost blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a laxative is contraindicated as it can increase gastrointestinal motility and worsen the bleeding. Offering oral fluids is also inappropriate because the client must be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for a potential emergent endoscopy and to reduce the risk of aspiration if their level of consciousness declines.",
