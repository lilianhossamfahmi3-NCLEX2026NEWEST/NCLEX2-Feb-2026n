    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, anxiety, diaphoresis) secondary to an acute upper GI bleed, likely due to esophageal varices or peptic ulcer disease exacerbated by cirrhosis. The immediate priorities are to restore intravascular volume, stabilize the bleeding site, monitor for complications, and prepare for blood product replacement. Establishing two large-bore IVs (18-gauge or larger) is critical for rapid fluid and blood administration to combat hypovolemic shock. Administering an IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like pantoprazole helps to decrease gastric acid production, raising the gastric pH, which promotes clot stability and reduces further bleeding. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential because hypovolemia and electrolyte shifts (common in liver disease and bleeding) can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Preparing for a transfusion by obtaining a type and crossmatch is a key step in replacing lost blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity with packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The goal is to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a laxative is contraindicated as it can increase gastrointestinal motility and worsen the bleeding, potentially dislodging clots and leading to further hemorrhage. Offering oral fluids is also inappropriate because the client must be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for a potential emergent endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) to identify and treat the bleeding source (e.g., banding varices, cauterizing ulcers) and to reduce the risk of aspiration if their level of consciousness declines due to hypoperfusion.",

Administering a high-dose IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like pantoprazole reduces gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme in parietal cells.
