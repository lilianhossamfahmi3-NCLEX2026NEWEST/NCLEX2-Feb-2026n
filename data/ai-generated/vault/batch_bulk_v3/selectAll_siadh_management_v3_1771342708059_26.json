        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation (confusion, headache) and laboratory values (hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, high urine specific gravity and sodium) are classic signs of SIADH, a condition of excessive ADH secretion leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. The cornerstone of management is treating the underlying cause and correcting the hyponatremia. Key nursing actions include restricting fluid intake to prevent further dilution of serum sodium, implementing safety measures due to the risk of seizures from cerebral edema secondary to severe hyponatremia, frequently monitoring neurological status to detect deterioration, and providing comfort measures like oral care to manage thirst from the fluid restriction.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that would introduce more free water into the system are contraindicated and dangerous. This includes administering hypotonic IV solutions (like 0.45% NaCl) or encouraging oral fluid intake, as these actions would worsen the dilutional hyponatremia and cerebral edema. Administering desmopressin, a synthetic form of ADH, is the treatment for Diabetes Insipidus (a deficiency of ADH) and would exacerbate SIADH by promoting even more water reabsorption.",
