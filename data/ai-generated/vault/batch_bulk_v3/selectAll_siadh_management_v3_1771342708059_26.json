    "correct": "The client exhibits classic signs of SIADH: confusion, headache, muscle cramping, hyponatremia (Na+ 118 mEq/L), low serum osmolality (265 mOsm/kg), high urine specific gravity (1.035), and elevated urine sodium (45 mEq/L). In SIADH, excessive ADH secretion causes the kidneys to retain water, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. The priority is to prevent complications of hyponatremia, such as seizures and neurological damage. Fluid restriction is crucial to reduce water retention and allow sodium levels to rise. Frequent neurological checks monitor for cerebral edema. Oral care addresses thirst caused by fluid restriction.",
