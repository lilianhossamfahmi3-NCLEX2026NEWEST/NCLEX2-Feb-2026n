The client's clinical presentation, including confusion, disorientation, and asterixis, combined with a significantly elevated serum ammonia level (150 mcg/dL), are classic signs of hepatic encephalopathy.

While a paracentesis is indicated to relieve the respiratory distress caused by tense ascites, it does not directly treat the underlying cause of the encephalopathy (high ammonia).
