The client is receiving morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The nurse completes an assessment and reviews the electronic health record.

This occurs due to the lodging of fat emboli in the capillaries, causing capillary damage and subsequent extravasation of red blood cells. The presence of petechiae strongly suggests FES and warrants immediate intervention.</p><p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Fat emboli obstruct small blood vessels, leading to endothelial damage and increased permeability. This results in leakage of blood into the surrounding tissues, causing the characteristic petechial rash.</p><p><b>Clinical Pearl:</b> Petechiae in FES typically appear 24-72 hours after the injury. Its presence, combined with respiratory and neurological symptoms, is highly indicative of FES.</p>",
