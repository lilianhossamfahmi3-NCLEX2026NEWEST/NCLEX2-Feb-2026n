    "correct": "The correct actions focus on protecting the integrity of the myelomeningocele sac, preventing infection, and monitoring for the most common and immediate complication, hydrocephalus. This includes keeping the sac moist and sterile (sterile saline dressing), preventing pressure on the sac (prone positioning), and assessing for signs of increased intracranial pressure (measuring head circumference, monitoring fontanels and cry).",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect actions either pose a direct threat to the infant or are inappropriate for the immediate pre-operative period. Tightly diapering risks sac rupture and fecal contamination. Passive range of motion to the lower extremities could cause further neurological damage by putting traction on the exposed spinal cord.
