        "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency characterized by a massive, imbalanced sympathetic nervous system response to a noxious stimulus below the level of a T6 or higher spinal cord injury. The priority actions are to immediately address the severe hypertension to prevent stroke or seizure and to identify and remove the offending stimulus. Indicated actions include sitting the client upright (high-Fowler's) to cause orthostatic hypotension, assessing for and resolving the most common cause (bladder distention), and administering a rapid-acting antihypertensive like IV hydralazine if initial measures fail. Actions that would worsen hypertension (placing the client supine) or cause unpredictable, severe hypotension (sublingual nifedipine) are contraindicated. Actions that are too slow-acting for the acute crisis (stool softener) are not indicated at this time.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections fail to prioritize immediate interventions to lower blood pressure and remove the stimulus. Classifying an indicated action as contraindicated (e.g., sitting the client up) would delay treatment. Classifying a contraindicated action as indicated (e.g., placing the client supine or giving sublingual nifedipine) could cause significant harm by worsening the hypertensive crisis or causing precipitous hypotension. Mistaking a preventative measure (stool softener) for an acute intervention demonstrates a misunderstanding of the emergent nature of AD.",
