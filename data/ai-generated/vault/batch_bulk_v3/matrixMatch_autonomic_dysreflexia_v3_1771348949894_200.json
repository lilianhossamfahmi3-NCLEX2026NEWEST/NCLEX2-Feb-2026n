    "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a potentially life-threatening condition triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of the spinal cord injury (typically T6 and above). This results in an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response, causing severe hypertension. The priority is to reduce blood pressure and identify/remove the trigger. High-Fowler's position promotes orthostatic hypotension, aiding in BP reduction. Bladder distention is a common trigger; assessing and resolving it is crucial. IV hydralazine is a rapid-acting antihypertensive for severe cases. Sublingual nifedipine can cause precipitous hypotension and is contraindicated. Supine positioning increases venous return, worsening hypertension. Stool softeners are preventative, not acute treatments. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Noxious stimuli (e.g., bladder distention, fecal impaction, pressure ulcers) trigger afferent nerve impulses that ascend the spinal cord. In individuals with spinal cord injuries above T6, these impulses cannot reach the brain due to the spinal cord lesion. This blockage prevents the normal inhibitory signals from the brain, leading to an exaggerated sympathetic response below the level of the injury. This results in vasoconstriction and a dramatic increase in blood pressure. The body attempts to compensate via the vagus nerve, causing bradycardia. However, the vagal response is often insufficient to counteract the intense sympathetic activity below the lesion. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always suspect autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injuries above T6 presenting with sudden hypertension, headache, and bradycardia. Rapid intervention is crucial to prevent stroke, seizure, or death.",
