    "general": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms suggestive of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), a serious complication following long bone fractures. FES typically manifests 12-72 hours post-injury. The classic triad includes respiratory distress, neurological dysfunction, and petechial rash. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.",

      {
        "id": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 128/min (tachycardia) is a non-specific finding. While it can indicate physiological stress, pain, fever, hypovolemia, or anxiety can also cause it. In the context of potential FES, respiratory and neurological changes are more specific and concerning.",
        "isCorrect": false

        "id": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. An SpO2 of 89% on 4L nasal cannula at 26 hours post-injury (0200) indicates significant hypoxemia. In FES, fat globules released from the bone marrow obstruct pulmonary capillaries, leading to inflammation, impaired gas exchange, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This results in hypoxemia and can progress to ARDS. Immediate intervention, including increasing oxygen support and potentially intubation, is required.",

        "id": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. A reported pain level of 7/10, while requiring attention, is expected post-operatively after an ORIF. While adequate pain management is important, it is not the priority in the presence of potential FES symptoms. The focus should be on addressing the respiratory and neurological compromise.",

        "rationale": "Correct. The progression from awake, alert, and oriented to anxious, restless, and then confused at 26 hours post-injury (0200) is a critical neurological finding. Fat emboli can travel to the cerebral circulation, causing microvascular occlusion, ischemia, and cerebral edema. This neurological dysfunction is a key component of the FES triad and indicates a severe complication requiring immediate investigation and management.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. A temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) is a low-grade fever and can be a normal postoperative response to inflammation. While fever can be associated with FES, it is a non-specific finding. The profound hypoxia and acute neurological changes are more concerning and require immediate attention.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Petechiae on the upper chest and axillae at 26 hours post-injury (0200) are a pathognomonic sign of FES. These small, non-blanching, reddish-purple spots are caused by fat emboli obstructing dermal capillaries, leading to capillary rupture and extravasation of blood. The presence of petechiae strongly supports the diagnosis of FES and warrants immediate action.",

    "Neurological changes in FES can range from restlessness and confusion to seizures and coma. Assess neurological status frequently.",
    "Petechiae are a late sign of FES but are highly specific. Look for them on the upper chest, neck, axillae, and conjunctivae.",
    "Prophylactic measures, such as early fracture stabilization and adequate hydration, can help reduce the risk of FES.",

Key findings include: SpO2 of 89% on 4L nasal cannula, new onset of confusion, and petechiae on the upper chest and axillae. Vital signs: HR 128/min, RR 30/min, BP 122/74 mmHg, Temp 38.1°C.",
