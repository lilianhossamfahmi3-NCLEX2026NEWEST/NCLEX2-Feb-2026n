The nurse's assessment reveals increasing muscle fatigue, bilateral ptosis, and difficulty managing oral secretions. The client's vital signs are: Temperature 98.8°F (37.1°C), heart rate 118/min, respiratory rate 28/min, blood pressure 152/88 mmHg, and SpO2 91% on room air. The nurse notes the client has a very weak, non-productive cough. Which action should the nurse take first?",

The tachypnea, tachycardia, borderline hypoxia (SpO2 91%), and inability to manage secretions (weak cough) indicate imminent respiratory failure. The priority action, according to Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) principles, is to maintain a patent airway. Elevating the head of the bed improves chest expansion and reduces the risk of aspiration, while preparing suction allows for immediate intervention to clear secretions.",

While pyridostigmine is a key medication, its onset is not fast enough to resolve an acute airway issue. A swallow evaluation is necessary but not the first action during respiratory distress. Assessing pupils is irrelevant as they are not affected in myasthenia gravis.",
