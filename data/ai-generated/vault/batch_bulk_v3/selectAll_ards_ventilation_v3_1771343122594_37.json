        "correct": "The appropriate interventions for this client with severe ARDS involve improving oxygenation, maintaining perfusion, and preventing complications. The client's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 103 (62 mmHg / 0.60), indicating severe ARDS, for which prone positioning is an evidence-based therapy to improve ventilation/perfusion matching. Maintaining hemodynamic stability with vasopressors to achieve a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg is crucial for organ perfusion in septic shock. Preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) through meticulous oral care is a standard component of the ventilator care bundle for all intubated clients.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that would worsen lung injury, fluid balance, or oxygenation are contraindicated. Increasing tidal volume violates the principle of lung-protective ventilation and risks barotrauma/volutrauma. Administering a large fluid bolus is contraindicated in ARDS, as it can worsen pulmonary edema due to increased capillary permeability. Decreasing PEEP would lead to alveolar derecruitment and a significant decline in oxygenation for a client who is already severely hypoxemic.",
