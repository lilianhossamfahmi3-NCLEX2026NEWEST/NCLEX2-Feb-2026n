    "correct": "The client exhibits signs of severe ARDS, evidenced by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 103 (62 mmHg / 0.60), indicating impaired gas exchange. Prone positioning is crucial as it redistributes lung perfusion, reduces compression of alveoli in dependent lung regions, and improves ventilation-perfusion matching, ultimately enhancing oxygenation. Sepsis-induced hypotension necessitates vasopressor support to maintain adequate organ perfusion. Norepinephrine, a potent vasopressor, should be titrated to achieve a MAP of at least 65 mmHg, ensuring sufficient blood flow to vital organs like the kidneys and brain. Intubated clients are at high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Chlorhexidine oral care reduces the bacterial load in the oropharynx, decreasing the risk of aspiration of colonized secretions into the lower respiratory tract, a key step in VAP prevention.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a large fluid bolus can exacerbate pulmonary edema in ARDS due to increased capillary permeability, worsening oxygenation. ARDS management focuses on a conservative fluid strategy. Decreasing PEEP would lead to alveolar collapse (atelectasis), further impairing gas exchange and worsening hypoxemia. PEEP helps keep alveoli open, improving oxygenation. Increasing tidal volume beyond the recommended lung-protective ventilation strategy (6 mL/kg) can cause volutrauma and barotrauma, leading to further lung injury and inflammation.",
