        "correct": "The nurse must prioritize interventions based on specific clinical findings in a client with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall ST-elevation MI (STEMI), requiring immediate reperfusion therapy, for which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the gold standard. Severe chest pain (8/10) requires IV morphine for analgesia and its hemodynamic benefits. Hypotension (BP 86/50 mmHg) in the context of an inferior MI suggests potential right ventricular involvement, which is preload-dependent; therefore, an IV fluid bolus is indicated to improve cardiac output, and vasodilators like nitroglycerin are contraindicated. Crackles indicate developing pulmonary edema from left ventricular dysfunction, necessitating oxygen to improve saturation and reduce myocardial workload. Finally, frequent, new-onset PVCs signify ventricular irritability and increase the risk of lethal arrhythmias, requiring treatment with an antiarrhythmic like amiodarone.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting an incorrect intervention can lead to client harm. For instance, giving nitroglycerin to a hypotensive client would cause a critical drop in blood pressure. Delaying PCI for a STEMI increases myocardial damage. Failing to address hypoxia, pain, or ventricular irritability can lead to respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest, respectively. Administering a fluid bolus for crackles without hypotension would worsen pulmonary edema. Each intervention must be precisely matched to the finding it is intended to treat.",
