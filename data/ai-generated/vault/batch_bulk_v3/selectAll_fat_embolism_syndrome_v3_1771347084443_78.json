      {
        "id": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Correct. Petechial rash is a hallmark sign of FES, typically appearing 24-36 hours post-injury. Fat emboli obstruct dermal capillaries, causing microhemorrhages. The rash is often found on the chest, neck, axillae, and conjunctiva. The pathophysiology involves the release of free fatty acids from the emboli, leading to endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability. This allows red blood cells to leak into the surrounding tissue, creating the characteristic petechiae.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. Neurological changes, such as confusion, restlessness, and agitation, are major criteria for FES. Fat emboli travel to the cerebral circulation, causing hypoxia and inflammation. The pathophysiology involves the emboli obstructing cerebral blood flow, leading to ischemia and neuronal damage. Additionally, inflammatory mediators released in response to the fat emboli can further exacerbate neurological dysfunction.",

      },
      {
        "id": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Correct. Hypoxemia is a common and early manifestation of FES. Fat globules obstruct pulmonary capillaries, leading to impaired gas exchange and acute respiratory distress. The pathophysiology involves the fat emboli triggering an inflammatory response in the lungs, causing pulmonary edema and increased alveolar-capillary permeability. This results in ventilation-perfusion mismatch and decreased oxygen diffusion.",
        "isCorrect": true

      {
        "id": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Unilateral calf swelling and tenderness are indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), not FES. DVT involves the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, typically in the leg. The pathophysiology of DVT involves Virchow's triad: venous stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability. While DVT is a risk post-operatively, it is distinct from FES.",

      {
        "id": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Purulent drainage indicates a surgical site infection, not FES. Surgical site infections are caused by bacteria entering the surgical incision. The pathophysiology involves bacterial proliferation, inflammation, and tissue damage. While fever may be present in both FES and infection, the other clinical signs and the presence of purulent drainage point towards infection.",

        "rationale": "Correct. A PaO2 of 58 mmHg indicates severe hypoxemia, a key diagnostic criterion for FES. Normal PaO2 is 80-100 mmHg. This low PaO2 reflects significant impairment in gas exchange due to fat emboli obstructing pulmonary capillaries and causing inflammation. The pathophysiology involves the fat emboli leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, intrapulmonary shunting, and decreased oxygen diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. This results in a significant reduction in arterial oxygen levels.",

Anticipate orders for increased oxygen support, possible intubation and mechanical ventilation, and further diagnostic testing to confirm FES. Monitor closely for worsening respiratory or neurological status. Consider STAT V/Q scan to rule out PE."

    "The stem mentions '36 hours post-operative'. When documenting or communicating, convert this to military time for clarity and consistency. For example, if the surgery was at 0800, then 36 hours later would be 2000 the next day.",
    "When documenting medication administration times or assessment findings, use military time to avoid ambiguity. For example, document 'Petechial rash noted at 1400' instead of 'Petechial rash noted at 2 PM'.",
    "When communicating with the healthcare provider, use military time to ensure clear and concise information transfer, especially during critical situations like suspected FES.",
    "Document all interventions and patient responses using military time for accurate tracking of the patient's condition and treatment effectiveness."
