                "rationale": "Correct. A petechial rash, particularly on the upper chest, neck, axillae, and conjunctiva, is a pathognomonic sign of FES. It is caused by the occlusion of dermal capillaries by fat emboli, leading to microhemorrhages. It typically appears 24-36 hours after the initial injury.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Acute neurological changes, such as confusion, restlessness, agitation, or a decreased level of consciousness, are major criteria for diagnosing FES. These symptoms result from fat emboli traveling to the cerebral circulation, causing hypoxia and ischemic changes in the brain.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Hypoxemia, indicated by a low oxygen saturation, is the earliest and most common manifestation of FES. Fat globules travel to the lungs, obstructing pulmonary capillaries and causing an inflammatory response that leads to impaired gas exchange and acute respiratory distress.",

While DVT is a common complication of long bone fractures and immobility, it has a different pathophysiology involving venous stasis and thrombus formation.",
