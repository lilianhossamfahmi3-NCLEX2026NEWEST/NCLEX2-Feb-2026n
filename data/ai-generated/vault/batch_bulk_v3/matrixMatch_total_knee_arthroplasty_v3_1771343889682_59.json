Recognizing expected findings (e.g., controlled pain, minimal drainage, low-grade fever) prevents unnecessary interventions. Identifying situations that require nursing intervention (e.g., inadequate use of incentive spirometry) allows the nurse to provide education and prevent complications like atelectasis. Finally, identifying adverse findings (e.g., signs of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) is critical for initiating rapid response and preventing mortality.",
