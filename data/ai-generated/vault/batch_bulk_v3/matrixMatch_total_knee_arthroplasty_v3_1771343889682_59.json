            "A postoperative fever within the first 72 hours is most commonly due to the systemic inflammatory response, not infection. Suspect infection if the fever is high-grade (>38.5°C), persists beyond 72 hours, or is accompanied by other signs like purulent drainage.",
            "Effective client education is a primary nursing intervention. Many postoperative complications, like atelectasis, can be prevented by ensuring the client understands and adheres to the care plan."

        "questionTrap": "The primary trap is misclassifying the low-grade fever. While fever can indicate infection, a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C) within 48-72 hours post-op is a common, expected inflammatory response. Do not classify it as adverse without other signs of infection (e.g., purulent drainage, rising WBC count).",
        "mnemonic": "For post-op DVT/PE red flags, remember 'PULSE':\n- P: Pain (pleuritic chest pain or calf pain)\n- U: Unilateral leg swelling\n- L: Low SpO2 (hypoxemia)\n- S: Sudden shortness of breath\n- E: Elevated heart rate and respirations (tachycardia/tachypnea)"
