    "correct": "The nurse must accurately interpret postoperative findings to determine if the client's recovery is progressing as expected or if complications are present. Recognizing expected findings (e.g., controlled pain, minimal drainage, low-grade fever) prevents unnecessary interventions. Identifying situations requiring nursing intervention (e.g., inadequate incentive spirometry use) allows for timely education and prevention of complications like atelectasis. Recognizing adverse findings (e.g., signs of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) is crucial for initiating rapid response and preventing mortality.",
