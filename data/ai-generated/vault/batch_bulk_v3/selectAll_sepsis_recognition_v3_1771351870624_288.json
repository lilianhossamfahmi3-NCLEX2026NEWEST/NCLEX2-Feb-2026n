        "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The nurse must recognize cues that indicate this systemic response is occurring. Key indicators based on the Sepsis-3 (qSOFA) and SIRS criteria include hypotension (SBP ≤100 mm Hg), altered mental status, tachypnea (RR ≥22/min), tachycardia (HR >90/min), and leukocytosis (WBC >12,000/mm³). These findings collectively point to widespread inflammation and potential organ hypoperfusion, necessitating immediate escalation of care and intervention to prevent progression to septic shock.",
        "incorrect": "To accurately identify sepsis, the nurse must differentiate between significant cues and findings that are either normal or less specific. A capillary refill of 2 seconds is a normal finding, indicating adequate peripheral perfusion. While a urine output of 40 mL/hr warrants monitoring, it is still considered adequate (greater than the 30 mL/hr or 0.5 mL/kg/hr minimum) and is not, by itself, a definitive cue for the acute kidney injury associated with sepsis.",

Although it requires close monitoring, a urine output of 40 mL/hr is still considered adequate, as it is above the minimum threshold of 30 mL/hr (or >0.5 mL/kg/hr).
