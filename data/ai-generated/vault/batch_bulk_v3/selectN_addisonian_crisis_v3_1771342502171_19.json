This includes correcting profound hypovolemia and hypotension with rapid IV fluid resuscitation (0.9% sodium chloride), replacing the deficient cortisol with IV hydrocortisone, correcting hypoglycemia with IV dextrose, and monitoring for cardiac complications from hyperkalemia. These interventions address the primary pathophysiological derangements: lack of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.",
