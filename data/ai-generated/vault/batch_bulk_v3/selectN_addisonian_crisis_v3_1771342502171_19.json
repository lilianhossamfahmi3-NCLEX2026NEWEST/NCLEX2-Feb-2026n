    "correct": "The priority actions in Addisonian crisis are aimed at stabilizing the client and addressing the underlying hormonal deficiencies. Rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride (Option B) addresses the severe hypovolemia and hypotension resulting from mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency, which leads to sodium and water loss. Continuous cardiac monitoring (Option C) is crucial due to the hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. IV hydrocortisone (Option D) replaces the deficient cortisol, essential for glucose regulation, blood pressure support, and stress response. Administering 50% dextrose IV push (Option F) corrects the hypoglycemia resulting from impaired gluconeogenesis due to cortisol deficiency. These interventions directly counteract the pathophysiological consequences of acute adrenal insufficiency.",
    "incorrect": "Administering spironolactone (Option A) is contraindicated as it would exacerbate the existing hyperkalemia, potentially leading to fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Initiating a sodium-restricted diet (Option E) would worsen the hyponatremia, potentially causing neurological complications.",

Avoid potassium-sparing diuretics and sodium restriction. Closely monitor vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and lab values. Consider obtaining an ECG to assess for hyperkalemia-related changes."
