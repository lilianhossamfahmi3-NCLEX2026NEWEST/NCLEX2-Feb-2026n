The client's morning headaches, daytime sleepiness, and borderline SpO2 are classic signs of nocturnal hypoventilation, making a referral for NIPPV evaluation an indicated priority. The client's EF of 40% and pitting edema signify cardiomyopathy with heart failure, making beta-blocker therapy indicated and fluid/sodium loading contraindicated. Chronic steroid use makes live vaccines contraindicated and nutritional assessment essential to manage side effects. High-impact exercise is contraindicated as it accelerates muscle damage.",

Failing to identify the need for NIPPV ignores impending respiratory failure. Classifying high-impact exercise or increased sodium/fluid intake as indicated could cause direct harm by accelerating muscle breakdown and exacerbating heart failure, respectively. Overlooking the contraindication for live vaccines in an immunocompromised client creates a significant risk for infection.",
