The client's potassium of 6.8 mEq/L with associated ECG changes (peaked T waves, wide QRS) indicates severe hyperkalemia, which poses an immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. The first priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane by administering IV calcium gluconate. The next step is to temporarily lower serum potassium by shifting it into the cells using IV regular insulin and dextrose. Following this, a medication that actually removes potassium from the body, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, is administered. Finally, dietary management with a low-potassium, low-protein diet is essential to prevent further accumulation of potassium and nitrogenous waste products.",

Not administering calcium gluconate first ignores the imminent risk of cardiac arrest. Using furosemide in an oliguric AKI patient is likely ineffective. Choosing incorrect medications like sevelamer (a phosphate binder) or lactulose (for ammonia) does not address hyperkalemia. Selecting an inappropriate diet, such as high-protein or high-potassium, would worsen the client's metabolic derangements.",
