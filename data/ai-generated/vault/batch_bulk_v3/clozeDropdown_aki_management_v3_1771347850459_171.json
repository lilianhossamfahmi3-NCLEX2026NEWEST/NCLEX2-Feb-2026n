    "correct": "The correct sequence of actions addresses the life-threatening complications of AKI in order of priority. The client's potassium of 6.8 mEq/L with associated ECG changes (peaked T waves, wide QRS) indicates severe hyperkalemia, which poses an immediate risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. The first priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane by administering IV calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential, making the heart less excitable and resistant to the effects of hyperkalemia. The next step is to temporarily lower serum potassium by shifting it into the cells using IV regular insulin and dextrose. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium pump, promoting potassium entry into cells, while dextrose prevents hypoglycemia. Following this, a medication that actually removes potassium from the body, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, is administered. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate exchanges sodium for potassium in the gut, leading to potassium excretion in the feces. Finally, dietary management with a low-potassium, low-protein diet is essential to prevent further accumulation of potassium and nitrogenous waste products. Limiting potassium intake reduces the potassium load, and reducing protein intake minimizes the production of urea and other nitrogenous wastes.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections fail to prioritize the immediate life threat or choose suboptimal or contraindicated interventions. Not administering calcium gluconate first ignores the imminent risk of cardiac arrest. Using furosemide in an oliguric AKI patient is likely ineffective. Choosing incorrect medications like sevelamer (a phosphate binder) or lactulose (for ammonia) does not address hyperkalemia. Selecting an inappropriate diet, such as high-protein or high-potassium, would worsen the client's metabolic derangements.",
