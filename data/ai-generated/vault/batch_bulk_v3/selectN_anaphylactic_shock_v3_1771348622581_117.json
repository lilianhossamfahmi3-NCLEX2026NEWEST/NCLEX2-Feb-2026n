    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 52-year-old client in the emergency department who just returned from a CT scan with intravenous contrast. The client, with case ID 1771-3486, suddenly develops diffuse erythema, urticaria, and reports feeling 'anxious with a tight throat.' The nurse's rapid assessment reveals inspiratory stridor, an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air, and a blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg. Which actions should the nurse implement immediately? Select all that apply.",
