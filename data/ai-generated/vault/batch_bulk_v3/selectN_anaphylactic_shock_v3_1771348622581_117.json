  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 52-year-old client in the emergency department who just returned from a CT scan with intravenous contrast. The client, with case ID 1771-3486, suddenly develops diffuse erythema, urticaria, and reports feeling 'anxious with a tight throat.' The nurse's rapid assessment reveals inspiratory stridor, an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air, and a blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg. Which actions should the nurse implement immediately? Select all that apply.",

      "rationale": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.  The alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure. Beta-1 adrenergic effects increase heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output. Beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, reducing airway resistance and improving oxygenation.  In anaphylaxis, mast cells and basophils release histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, leading to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchospasm, and increased mucus production. Epinephrine reverses these effects. Administer 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1:1,000 solution) into the mid-outer thigh.  Clinical Pearl:  Always assess for improved breathing and blood pressure after administration.  Repeat dose every 5-15 minutes as needed.",

      "rationale": "Placing a client with hypotension in high-Fowler's position can worsen hypotension by decreasing venous return to the heart.  Anaphylaxis causes distributive shock due to massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. This leads to a decrease in preload (volume returning to the heart).  High-Fowler's position further reduces preload by pooling blood in the lower extremities. The client should be placed supine with legs elevated (if tolerated) to promote venous return and improve cerebral perfusion. Clinical Pearl: Trendelenburg position is no longer recommended due to potential for increased intracranial pressure and impaired respiratory effort.",

      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The client is exhibiting signs of respiratory distress (stridor, SpO2 89%) due to bronchospasm and potential laryngeal edema.  Anaphylaxis causes airway inflammation and constriction, impairing gas exchange.  High-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-95%), increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and improving oxygen saturation.  Clinical Pearl:  Monitor the client's respiratory effort, rate, and oxygen saturation closely. Be prepared to assist with intubation if respiratory status deteriorates despite oxygen administration.",

      "rationale": "Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is an antihistamine that blocks histamine receptors, reducing urticaria and pruritus. While helpful for managing cutaneous symptoms, it does not address the life-threatening airway obstruction or hypotension associated with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the priority medication to reverse the systemic effects of anaphylaxis. Clinical Pearl: Diphenhydramine is a secondary medication in anaphylaxis management and should be administered after epinephrine.",

The Rapid Response Team (RRT) consists of critical care experts (e.g., physician, respiratory therapist, critical care nurse) who can provide advanced airway management, administer medications, and monitor the client's response to treatment.  Early activation of the RRT ensures timely access to specialized resources and improves the client's chances of survival. Clinical Pearl: Know your institution's protocol for activating the RRT or calling a code. Provide a concise SBAR report to the team.",

Rapid infusion of an isotonic crystalloid solution (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride) expands the intravascular volume, increasing preload and improving cardiac output and blood pressure.  Clinical Pearl: Monitor the client for signs of fluid overload (e.g., crackles, edema, jugular venous distension) during fluid resuscitation.  Typical initial bolus is 1-2 liters in adults.",
