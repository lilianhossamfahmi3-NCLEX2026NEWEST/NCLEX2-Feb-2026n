    "overallRationale": "The correct response pattern reflects prioritizing maternal stabilization in a client with preeclampsia with severe features and potential magnesium toxicity. Key actions include addressing the severe hypertension with labetalol, stopping the magnesium sulfate due to signs of toxicity (respiratory depression), and implementing seizure precautions (reducing stimuli). Preparing for immediate delivery is inappropriate as maternal stabilization is the priority, and a fluid bolus or supine positioning are contraindicated due to risks of pulmonary edema and vena cava compression, respectively.",
    "rows": [
      {
        "row": 0,
        "correctColumn": "Contraindicated",
        "rationale": "**Contraindicated:** Increasing the IV fluid rate is contraindicated. Preeclampsia causes endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifting into the interstitial space (third-spacing). The client's oliguria (40 mL over 2 hours) suggests potential renal compromise. Rapid IV fluid administration can lead to fluid volume overload and life-threatening pulmonary edema. The damaged endothelium allows fluid to leak into the lungs, compromising gas exchange.",
        "pathophysiology": "Preeclampsia-induced endothelial dysfunction increases capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts and potential pulmonary edema. Oliguria indicates impaired renal perfusion and function, further increasing the risk of fluid overload.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In preeclampsia, monitor fluid balance closely and avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation unless indicated for hypovolemia from hemorrhage. Assess lung sounds frequently for signs of pulmonary edema."

        "row": 1,
        "correctColumn": "Appropriate",
        "rationale": "**Appropriate:** Administering labetalol 20 mg IV push as prescribed is appropriate. The client's blood pressure of 168/112 mmHg indicates a hypertensive crisis, placing her at high risk for cerebrovascular accident (stroke) or placental abruption. Labetalol is a beta-blocker and alpha-1 blocker that rapidly lowers blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance without significantly affecting heart rate.",
        "pathophysiology": "Severe hypertension in preeclampsia can cause endothelial damage in cerebral vessels, leading to hemorrhage and stroke. It also increases the risk of placental abruption due to increased pressure on placental vessels.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Labetalol is a first-line antihypertensive in preeclampsia. Monitor blood pressure closely after administration to avoid precipitous drops, which can compromise placental perfusion."

      {
        "row": 2,
        "correctColumn": "Appropriate",
        "rationale": "**Appropriate:** Stopping the magnesium sulfate infusion is appropriate. A respiratory rate of 10 breaths/minute is a critical sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity, as magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant. The nurse's priority action is to stop the infusion to prevent progression to respiratory arrest. Calcium gluconate, the antidote for magnesium sulfate toxicity, should be readily available.",
        "pathophysiology": "Magnesium sulfate depresses the central nervous system, including the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and potential respiratory arrest.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor respiratory rate, deep tendon reflexes, and level of consciousness closely in clients receiving magnesium sulfate. Have calcium gluconate readily available to reverse toxicity."

      {
        "row": 3,
        "correctColumn": "Inappropriate",
        "rationale": "**Inappropriate:** Preparing the client for an immediate cesarean delivery is inappropriate at this time. While delivery is the definitive treatment for preeclampsia, the mother must be stabilized first. Addressing the life-threatening issues of severe hypertension and potential magnesium toxicity takes precedence. Proceeding to surgery without stabilizing the client significantly increases the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality.",
        "pathophysiology": "Uncontrolled hypertension and magnesium toxicity increase the risk of complications during surgery, such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Maternal stabilization is paramount before proceeding with delivery in preeclampsia with severe features. Optimize blood pressure, respiratory status, and seizure control before surgery."

        "row": 4,
        "correctColumn": "Appropriate",
        "rationale": "**Appropriate:** Dimming the lights and reducing environmental stimuli is appropriate. The assessment finding of +4 DTRs with clonus indicates severe central nervous system irritability and an imminent risk of an eclamptic seizure. Implementing seizure precautions, which includes creating a calm, quiet, and low-stimulus environment, is a crucial nursing intervention to help prevent a seizure.",
        "pathophysiology": "Increased central nervous system excitability in preeclampsia lowers the seizure threshold. External stimuli can trigger neuronal firing and lead to a seizure.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Implement seizure precautions in clients with preeclampsia, especially those with hyperreflexia and clonus. Pad side rails, have suction equipment readily available, and administer magnesium sulfate as prescribed."

        "row": 5,
        "correctColumn": "Contraindicated",
        "rationale": "**Contraindicated:** Placing a pregnant client at 36 weeks gestation in a supine position is contraindicated. The gravid uterus can compress the inferior vena cava and aorta (supine hypotensive syndrome). This decreases venous return to the heart, reduces cardiac output, and compromises placental perfusion, further jeopardizing both the mother and fetus.",
        "pathophysiology": "Compression of the inferior vena cava reduces venous return to the heart, decreasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Aortic compression reduces blood flow to the uterus and placenta, compromising fetal oxygenation.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Avoid supine positioning in pregnant clients, especially in the third trimester. Position the client on her left side to optimize venous return and placental perfusion."
