        "correct": "The correct response pattern reflects prioritizing maternal stabilization in a client with preeclampsia with severe features and potential magnesium toxicity. Key actions include addressing the severe hypertension with labetalol, stopping the magnesium sulfate due to signs of toxicity (respiratory depression), and implementing seizure precautions (reducing stimuli). Preparing for immediate delivery is inappropriate as maternal stabilization is the priority, and a fluid bolus or supine positioning are contraindicated due to risks of pulmonary edema and vena cava compression, respectively.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect response pattern may result from failing to recognize signs of magnesium toxicity, not prioritizing the management of severe hypertension, or implementing actions that could harm the client. For example, continuing magnesium sulfate despite a respiratory rate of 10/min could lead to respiratory arrest. Increasing IV fluids in an oliguric client with capillary leak syndrome could cause pulmonary edema. Preparing for delivery before stabilizing the mother places her at increased risk for intraoperative complications.",
