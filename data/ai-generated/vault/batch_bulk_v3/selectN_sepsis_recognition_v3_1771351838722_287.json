The facility nurse reports the client has been increasingly lethargic and confused over the past 24 hours and has had poor oral intake. The client's daughter is at the bedside and confirms the change in mental status is new.",

The selected options represent key criteria from sepsis screening tools (like SIRS and qSOFA). Hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 118/min), tachypnea (RR 26/min), leukocytosis (WBC 18,500/mm³), and altered mental status (new-onset confusion) are all classic indicators of a dysregulated host response to infection, necessitating prompt intervention to prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected options are either part of the client's chronic health history (COPD), within a range that is not acutely alarming in this specific clinical context (glucose of 165 mg/dL in a known diabetic), or a normal finding that does not support the diagnosis (normal temperature). While the absence of fever does not rule out sepsis, it is not a finding that triggers the protocol. The history of COPD is a risk factor, not an acute cue of sepsis.",
