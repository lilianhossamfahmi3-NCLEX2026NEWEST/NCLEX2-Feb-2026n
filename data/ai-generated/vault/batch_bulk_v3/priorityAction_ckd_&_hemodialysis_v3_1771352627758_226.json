Addressing the hypoxemia is more immediately life-threatening than the hypertension. Furthermore, removing fluid via hemodialysis will naturally lower the blood pressure, making it a secondary priority to respiratory stabilization."

While hyperkalemia is a significant risk in a client who has missed dialysis, the presenting signs and symptoms are classic for acute pulmonary edema. Action to stabilize the client's breathing is required before any further data review."
