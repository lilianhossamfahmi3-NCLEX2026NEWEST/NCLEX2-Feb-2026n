According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework of prioritization, addressing impaired gas exchange is the most immediate, life-saving action. Administering supplemental oxygen directly treats the hypoxemia and helps prevent further respiratory decompensation while other interventions are prepared. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** In ESRD, the kidneys' inability to excrete fluid leads to hypervolemia. Missed dialysis exacerbates this, causing fluid to shift into the pulmonary interstitial space and alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema. This impairs gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, driving more oxygen into the blood and improving SpO2.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Hypoxemia is a critical finding that requires immediate intervention to prevent further respiratory compromise and potential cardiac arrest.",

Preparing the client and the dialysis machine takes time. The client's acute hypoxemia must be addressed immediately to ensure patient stability before and during the initiation of dialysis.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Hemodialysis removes excess fluid and electrolytes, alleviating pulmonary edema. However, it requires time for preparation and initiation. Addressing the immediate threat of hypoxemia is crucial to prevent further organ damage from oxygen deprivation.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** While addressing the underlying cause (fluid overload) is important, immediate stabilization of life-threatening symptoms (hypoxemia) takes precedence.",

However, it is a supportive measure for the mechanics of breathing. Directly correcting the client's documented hypoxemia (SpO2 91%) with supplemental oxygen is a higher priority based on the ABCs.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** High-Fowler's position decreases venous return (preload) to the heart, reducing pulmonary congestion. It also improves lung expansion by decreasing pressure on the diaphragm. However, it does not directly address the impaired gas exchange causing hypoxemia.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** High-Fowler's is a valuable adjunct therapy for respiratory distress, but it should not replace interventions that directly improve oxygenation.",

        "rationale": "The client's blood pressure of 177/98 mmHg is significantly elevated, but it is primarily a consequence of the severe fluid overload. Addressing the hypoxemia is more immediately life-threatening than the hypertension. Furthermore, removing fluid via hemodialysis will naturally lower the blood pressure, making it a secondary priority to respiratory stabilization.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Hypertension in ESRD is often volume-dependent. The excess fluid increases blood volume, leading to increased cardiac output and elevated blood pressure. While labetalol can lower blood pressure, it does not address the underlying fluid overload causing the pulmonary edema and hypoxemia.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** In fluid overload scenarios, addressing the underlying fluid imbalance is often more effective than solely treating the elevated blood pressure with antihypertensive medications.",

While hyperkalemia is a significant risk in a client who has missed dialysis, the presenting signs and symptoms are classic for acute pulmonary edema. Action to stabilize the client's breathing is required before any further data review.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Hyperkalemia is a common complication of ESRD due to the kidneys' inability to excrete potassium. While it can cause life-threatening arrhythmias, the client's presenting symptoms are primarily related to pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. Addressing the respiratory distress is the immediate priority.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** While assessing potassium levels is important, it is not the priority when the client is exhibiting signs of acute respiratory distress.
