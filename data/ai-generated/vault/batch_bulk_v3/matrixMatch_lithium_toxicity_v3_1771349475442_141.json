For the last few days, he's been really confused, stumbling around the house, and his speech is slurred. He's also been complaining of nausea.' The client's medication list includes lithium carbonate and hydrochlorothiazide, which was started last week. The nurse suspects lithium toxicity. A stat lithium level is drawn.

Moderate (2.0-2.5 mEq/L) involves worsening neurological symptoms like ataxia and slurred speech. Severe (>2.5 mEq/L) is life-threatening, with seizures, coma, and renal failure (oliguria). The client's new hydrochlorothiazide prescription likely caused this episode, as thiazide diuretics reduce renal clearance of lithium."
