For the last few days, he's been really confused, stumbling around the house, and his speech is slurred. He's also been complaining of nausea.' The client's medication list includes lithium carbonate and hydrochlorothiazide, which was started last week. The nurse suspects lithium toxicity. A stat lithium level is drawn.

Lithium affects the gastrointestinal system, leading to these symptoms as the body attempts to eliminate the excess lithium. The exact mechanism involves lithium's interference with electrolyte balance and neuronal excitability in the GI tract.",

Lithium's neurotoxic effects impair the motor control of speech muscles, resulting in difficulty articulating words clearly. This is due to lithium's impact on neuronal transmission in the brainstem and motor cortex.",

This finding is a hallmark of severe lithium toxicity (levels >2.5 mEq/L) and constitutes a medical emergency.

Impaired kidney function prevents lithium excretion, causing levels to rise even more rapidly. Lithium damages the renal tubules, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and reduced urine production. This can progress to acute kidney injury.",

Moderate (2.0-2.5 mEq/L) involves worsening neurological symptoms like ataxia and slurred speech. Severe (>2.5 mEq/L) is life-threatening, with seizures, coma, and renal failure (oliguria). The client's new hydrochlorothiazide prescription likely caused this episode, as thiazide diuretics reduce renal clearance of lithium. Monitor lithium levels closely in clients taking diuretics.",
