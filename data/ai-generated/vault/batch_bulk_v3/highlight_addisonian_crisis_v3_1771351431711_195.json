She states he has been unable to keep his oral hydrocortisone down for the past 24 hours due to nausea and vomiting. The client is difficult to arouse but responds to painful stimuli. He has complained of severe, diffuse abdominal pain. His surgical incision appears clean, dry, and intact with no erythema. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft but diffusely tender. Skin is cool and clammy with delayed capillary refill. He has not voided in 8 hours.",
