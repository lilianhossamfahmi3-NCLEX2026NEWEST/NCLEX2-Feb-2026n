        "rationale": "The client's history of Addison's disease is a critical cue. Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency, leading to deficient cortisol and aldosterone production. Surgical stress increases cortisol demand. Without adequate replacement, an Addisonian crisis can occur, characterized by life-threatening hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and hypoglycemia.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Always consider adrenal insufficiency in patients with unexplained hypotension, especially those with a known history or recent steroid use. Stressful events like surgery significantly increase cortisol requirements."

        "index": 5,
        "rationale": "Inability to take oral hydrocortisone for 24 hours, especially post-surgery, is a major precipitating factor for Addisonian crisis. Hydrocortisone is essential for replacing deficient cortisol. Vomiting prevents absorption, leading to acute cortisol deficiency and subsequent hemodynamic instability.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Patients unable to take oral glucocorticoids require immediate parenteral administration to prevent adrenal crisis. Educate patients on the importance of having injectable glucocorticoids available for emergencies."

        "index": 7,
        "rationale": "Altered mental status indicates impaired cerebral perfusion and metabolic dysfunction. In Addisonian crisis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) compromise brain function, leading to confusion, lethargy, and potential coma.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess mental status frequently in patients at risk for adrenal crisis. Changes in mentation are early indicators of worsening condition and require prompt intervention."

      {
        "index": 9,
        "rationale": "Severe, diffuse abdominal pain is a common gastrointestinal manifestation of Addisonian crisis. It results from hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased mesenteric perfusion. This pain can mimic other acute abdominal conditions, requiring careful differentiation.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Consider Addisonian crisis in patients presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, especially those with a history of adrenal insufficiency or recent steroid withdrawal. Rule out other causes but initiate treatment promptly."

        "index": 13,
        "rationale": "Cool, clammy skin and delayed capillary refill are signs of hypovolemic shock. In Addisonian crisis, aldosterone deficiency leads to sodium and water loss, causing profound hypovolemia and hypotension. Reduced cardiac output results in poor peripheral perfusion and these characteristic skin findings.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess peripheral perfusion frequently in patients at risk for hypovolemic shock. Cool, clammy skin and delayed capillary refill indicate significant circulatory compromise and require immediate fluid resuscitation."

        "rationale": "Oliguria (decreased urine output) indicates decreased renal perfusion secondary to hypovolemia and hypotension. In Addisonian crisis, reduced blood volume compromises renal blood flow, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and reduced urine production. Prolonged oliguria can lead to acute kidney injury.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Monitor urine output closely in patients at risk for hypovolemic shock. Oliguria is a late sign of shock and indicates significant compromise of renal function. Prompt intervention is needed to prevent acute kidney injury."

    "background": "Client underwent a cholecystectomy three days ago and has been unable to keep down oral hydrocortisone for the past 24 hours due to nausea and vomiting.",
    "assessment": "Client is difficult to arouse, has severe abdominal pain, cool and clammy skin with delayed capillary refill, and has not voided in 8 hours. Vital signs are likely to show hypotension and tachycardia. These findings are consistent with Addisonian crisis and hypovolemic shock.",
    "recommendation": "STAT administration of IV fluids (e.g., normal saline bolus) and IV hydrocortisone (e.g., 100 mg bolus). Monitor vital signs closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Obtain STAT blood glucose and electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and cortisol. Consider transfer to ICU for closer monitoring and management. Anticipate the need for vasopressors if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone administration."
