  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Preoperative management of pheochromocytoma focuses on controlling hypertension and preventing hypertensive crisis by blocking the effects of excessive catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) released by the tumor. Alpha-adrenergic blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, prazosin) are administered to induce vasodilation, counteracting the vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines. Orthostatic hypotension is a common side effect of alpha-blockade, requiring careful monitoring. A high-sodium diet promotes plasma volume expansion, mitigating hypotension caused by vasodilation. Abdominal palpation is strictly avoided to prevent tumor manipulation and subsequent catecholamine release.",
    "incorrect": "Strenuous activity, fluid restriction, and beta-blocker administration before alpha-blockade are contraindicated. Strenuous activity can stimulate catecholamine release. Fluid restriction exacerbates hypotension. Beta-blockers administered before alpha-blockers can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing severe vasoconstriction and hypertensive crisis.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. Encouraging frequent ambulation can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially triggering catecholamine release and a hypertensive crisis. Rest in a low-stimulus environment is preferred.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Increased physical activity can exacerbate catecholamine release from the tumor, leading to a dangerous surge in blood pressure. The goal is to minimize any stimuli that could provoke the tumor."

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Correct. Alpha-adrenergic blockers are essential for controlling hypertension by blocking the effects of catecholamines on alpha receptors, leading to vasodilation. This helps prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Alpha-adrenergic blockade is the cornerstone of preoperative management. By blocking alpha receptors, these medications prevent the vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines, thus controlling blood pressure and reducing the risk of hypertensive crisis during surgery. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for nasal congestion as a common side effect."

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker before establishing adequate alpha-blockade is dangerous. It can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing severe vasoconstriction and a life-threatening hypertensive crisis.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Beta-blockers should only be initiated *after* adequate alpha-blockade has been achieved. Giving a beta-blocker first can result in unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, leading to severe vasoconstriction and a paradoxical hypertensive crisis. Clinical Pearl: The mnemonic 'Alpha before Beta' helps remember the correct sequence."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Correct. Palpating the abdomen can directly stimulate the adrenal tumor, causing a sudden release of catecholamines into the circulation, leading to a hypertensive crisis.",

        "rationale": "Direct palpation of the abdomen can mechanically stimulate the tumor, causing a massive release of catecholamines. This can trigger a severe hypertensive crisis, tachycardia, and potentially cardiovascular collapse. Clinical Pearl: Place a sign above the bed: 'Do not palpate abdomen'."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Patients with pheochromocytoma often have reduced blood volume due to the chronic vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines. Alpha-blockers cause vasodilation, which further increases the capacity of the vascular system. Therefore, intravascular volume needs to be expanded, not restricted, to prevent severe hypotension. Clinical Pearl: Monitor urine output closely as an indicator of fluid status."

        "label": "F",
        "content": "Correct. Alpha-adrenergic blockade causes vasodilation, which can lead to orthostatic hypotension. Monitoring blood pressure in different positions is crucial to assess the degree of orthostatic hypotension and prevent falls.",

        "rationale": "Vasodilation induced by alpha-adrenergic blockers can cause significant orthostatic hypotension. Monitoring blood pressure in lying, sitting, and standing positions helps assess the severity of orthostatic hypotension and allows for appropriate interventions to prevent falls. Clinical Pearl: Educate the patient to change positions slowly."

        "label": "G",
        "content": "Correct. A high-sodium diet promotes plasma volume expansion, which helps counteract the vasodilation caused by alpha-blockers and prevents profound hypotension.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "After alpha-blockade is initiated, a high-sodium diet is encouraged to promote plasma volume expansion. This helps to counteract the vasodilation from the medication and prevent the profound hypotension that can occur both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Clinical Pearl: Monitor serum sodium levels to ensure adequate sodium intake."
