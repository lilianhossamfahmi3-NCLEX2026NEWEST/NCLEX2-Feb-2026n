        "correct": "The primary goals for preoperative management of pheochromocytoma are to control hypertension and prevent a hypertensive crisis, expand blood volume, and avoid activities that could trigger catecholamine release. This is achieved through the administration of alpha-adrenergic blockers to control blood pressure, followed by careful monitoring for the side effect of orthostatic hypotension. A high-sodium diet is then initiated to promote volume expansion to counteract the vasodilation caused by the alpha-blockade. Educating the client to avoid abdominal palpation is a critical safety measure to prevent manual stimulation of the tumor and a subsequent surge in catecholamines.",
        "incorrect": "Actions that are contraindicated include those that may precipitate a hypertensive crisis, such as strenuous activity or palpating the abdomen. Placing the client on fluid restriction is incorrect because volume expansion is needed to prevent severe hypotension after alpha-blockade is initiated. Administering a beta-blocker before an alpha-blocker is a critical error that can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing severe vasoconstriction and a life-threatening hypertensive crisis.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. Strenuous physical activity can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal tumor, leading to a massive release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and precipitating a life-threatening hypertensive crisis.

It can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation from circulating catecholamines, resulting in severe peripheral vasoconstriction and a paradoxical, life-threatening hypertensive crisis.
