  "answerBreakdown": {
    "condition": {
      "pc1": "Incorrect. Septic shock is a systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to vasodilation and hypotension. While the client exhibits fever and hypotension, the profound hypoglycemia (48 mg/dL), hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L) are more indicative of adrenal insufficiency. The client's history of Addison's disease and recent stressors (half-marathon, gastroenteritis) strongly suggest Addisonian crisis.",
      "pc2": "Correct. Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening condition caused by acute adrenal insufficiency, resulting in a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone. The client's presentation aligns with this diagnosis: history of Addison's disease, recent stressors, hypotension (84/52 mmHg), lethargy/confusion, hypoglycemia (48 mg/dL), hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L). The gastroenteritis exacerbated the condition by causing dehydration and electrolyte loss.",
      "pc3": "Incorrect. Hypovolemic shock results from decreased intravascular volume, leading to decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion. While the client is hypovolemic due to vomiting and diarrhea, the electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) and hypoglycemia are not typical findings in hypovolemic shock alone. Addisonian crisis explains the electrolyte and glucose abnormalities in the setting of hypovolemia.",
      "pc4": "Incorrect. Myxedema coma is a severe form of hypothyroidism characterized by decreased metabolic rate. Typical findings include hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and altered mental status. This client presents with fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, making myxedema coma unlikely.",
      "pc5": "Incorrect. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. The client's blood glucose is critically low (48 mg/dL), ruling out DKA."
    },
    "actions": {
      "att1": "Correct. IV hydrocortisone is the priority intervention for Addisonian crisis. Hydrocortisone replaces the deficient cortisol, addressing hypotension, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. It has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects, helping to restore fluid balance and blood pressure. Administer 100 mg IV bolus immediately. Clinical Pearl: Stress dosing of steroids is critical in Addisonian patients during illness or surgery.",
      "att2": "Incorrect. Administering insulin would further decrease the client's already critically low blood glucose (48 mg/dL), potentially leading to seizures, coma, and death. Insulin is contraindicated in this situation.",
      "att3": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, vasopressors like norepinephrine are not the first-line treatment. The priority is to address the underlying adrenal insufficiency with hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation. Vasopressors may be considered if the client remains hypotensive despite these interventions.",
      "att4": "Correct. The client's blood glucose is critically low (48 mg/dL), posing a significant risk of neurological damage. A bolus of 50% dextrose (D50) is necessary to rapidly increase the blood glucose level and prevent further complications. Administer D50 IV push per protocol. Clinical Pearl: Always check blood glucose in altered mental status patients.",
      "att5": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist. Administering spironolactone would worsen the client's hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L), potentially leading to life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. It is contraindicated in this situation."
    },
    "parameters": {
      "ptm1": "Correct. Blood pressure is a critical parameter to monitor. The client is hypotensive (84/52 mmHg), indicating impaired tissue perfusion. Monitoring blood pressure frequently (e.g., every 15 minutes initially) allows the nurse to assess the client's response to fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone therapy. An increasing blood pressure indicates improved hemodynamic stability.",
      "ptm2": "Incorrect. While electrolyte balance is important, calcium is not the primary electrolyte affected in Addisonian crisis. The priority is monitoring sodium, potassium, and glucose levels.",
      "ptm3": "Incorrect. Urine specific gravity reflects hydration status and kidney concentrating ability. While useful for assessing overall fluid balance, it is not as critical as monitoring blood pressure and serum potassium levels in the acute management of Addisonian crisis.",
      "ptm4": "Correct. The client has hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L), which can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Treatment with IV fluids and hydrocortisone will help shift potassium back into the cells and promote its excretion. Frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels (e.g., every 1-2 hours initially) is essential to ensure it is decreasing toward a normal range (3.5-5.0 mEq/L) and to prevent cardiac complications. Monitor ECG for changes.",
      "ptm5": "Incorrect. The client's respiratory rate is elevated (24/min), likely as a compensatory mechanism for shock. However, unless the client develops signs of respiratory failure (e.g., decreased oxygen saturation, increased work of breathing), monitoring respiratory effort is not as high a priority as monitoring blood pressure and potassium levels."
