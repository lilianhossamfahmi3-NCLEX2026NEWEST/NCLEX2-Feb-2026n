    "answerBreakdown": {
        "condition": {
            "pc1": "Incorrect. While the client has fever and hypotension, which are signs of septic shock, the specific constellation of symptoms including severe hypoglycemia (48 mg/dL), hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L) in a client with a history of Addison's disease following significant physical and illness-related stress makes Addisonian crisis the most specific and primary diagnosis.",
            "pc2": "Correct. This client's presentation is a classic Addisonian crisis, which is a life-threatening adrenal insufficiency. The key features are a history of Addison's disease, a recent stressor (half-marathon and gastroenteritis), profound hypotension, lethargy/confusion, and the characteristic lab triad of hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. These are direct results of cortisol and aldosterone deficiency.",
            "pc3": "Incorrect. The client is certainly hypovolemic due to vomiting and diarrhea. However, hypovolemic shock alone does not typically cause the severe hypoglycemia or the significant hyperkalemia seen in this client. The underlying adrenal insufficiency is the root cause of the shock state being so severe and producing these specific electrolyte abnormalities.",
            "pc4": "Incorrect. Myxedema coma is a severe form of hypothyroidism and typically presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoventilation, which are opposite to this client's tachycardia, fever, and tachypnea.",
            "pc5": "Incorrect. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by hyperglycemia, not the profound hypoglycemia (48 mg/dL) this client is experiencing. DKA also involves metabolic acidosis with ketonemia."
        },
        "actions": {
            "att1": "Correct. The immediate, life-saving treatment for an Addisonian crisis is the replacement of glucocorticoids. IV hydrocortisone is the drug of choice as it has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid properties, which will help stabilize blood pressure, correct hypoglycemia, and aid in resolving electrolyte imbalances.",
            "att2": "Incorrect. Administering insulin would be extremely dangerous for this client, as their blood glucose is already critically low at 48 mg/dL. Insulin would cause further, potentially fatal, hypoglycemia.",
            "att3": "Incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, vasopressors like norepinephrine are not the first-line treatment. The priority is to correct the underlying causes: volume depletion and cortisol deficiency. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone administration should be initiated first, as vasopressors will be less effective without correcting these issues.",
            "att4": "Correct. The client's blood glucose is critically low (48 mg/dL), and they have an altered mental status. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate correction. A bolus of 50% dextrose is necessary to rapidly raise the blood glucose level and prevent further neurological damage.",
            "att5": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and an aldosterone antagonist. Administering this medication would be harmful, as it would worsen the client's already dangerous hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L)."
        },
        "parameters": {
            "ptm1": "Correct. Blood pressure is a critical parameter to monitor. The client is in shock with a BP of 84/52 mmHg. Monitoring the blood pressure indicates the client's response to fluid resuscitation and IV hydrocortisone therapy. A rising blood pressure is a key indicator of successful treatment.",
            "ptm2": "Incorrect. While electrolyte balance is important, calcium is not the primary electrolyte affected in an Addisonian crisis. The priority is monitoring sodium, potassium, and glucose.",
            "ptm3": "Incorrect. Urine specific gravity reflects hydration status and kidney concentration ability. While useful, it is not as immediate or critical for monitoring the life-threatening hemodynamic and metabolic derangements of the crisis as blood pressure and serum potassium.",
            "ptm4": "Correct. The client has significant hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L), which can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Treatment with IV fluids and hydrocortisone will help shift potassium back into the cells and promote its excretion. Frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential to ensure it is decreasing toward a normal range and to prevent cardiac complications.",
            "ptm5": "Incorrect. The client's respiratory rate is elevated (24/min), likely as a compensatory mechanism for shock. However, unless the client develops signs of respiratory failure, monitoring respiratory effort is not as high a priority as monitoring the direct indicators of treatment response, such as blood pressure and potassium levels."
