The clear lung sounds also make PE more likely than conditions that cause fluid or consolidation in the alveoli.",

Atelectasis typically does not cause such sharp pleuritic pain or severe hypoxemia.

Pneumonia has a more insidious onset and is usually accompanied by fever and productive cough, with lung auscultation revealing crackles or rhonchi.",
