    "correct": "The client's presentation is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). Post-operative immobility significantly increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to PE. The sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain (exacerbated by inspiration), tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia are classic signs. The absence of adventitious lung sounds further supports PE over conditions like pneumonia. In PE, a blood clot obstructs pulmonary arteries, impairing gas exchange. This leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, causing hypoxemia and triggering compensatory mechanisms like increased respiratory rate and heart rate. The pleuritic chest pain arises from inflammation and irritation of the pleura due to the pulmonary infarction.",
    "incorrect": "Atelectasis, while common post-operatively, typically doesn't cause such severe, sudden pleuritic pain or hypoxemia, and lung sounds would likely be diminished. Myocardial infarction presents with crushing, substernal pain, often radiating, and is not typically pleuritic. Pneumonia usually develops more gradually with fever, productive cough, and abnormal lung sounds (crackles/rhonchi).",
