                "rationale": "Correct. Administering a high dose of an IV loop diuretic like furosemide is a priority intervention. It rapidly promotes diuresis, reducing circulating blood volume (preload) and alleviating pulmonary congestion, which is the primary cause of the client's dyspnea and hypoxemia."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is an immediate, non-pharmacological intervention that improves oxygenation. This position uses gravity to reduce venous return to the heart (preload) and allows for maximum diaphragmatic excursion and lung expansion, easing the work of breathing."
            },

                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While daily weights are essential for monitoring fluid status in heart failure, obtaining a weight is not an immediate life-saving action. The priority is to stabilize the client's respiratory and hemodynamic status. This can be done once the client is more stable."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. In acute decompensated heart failure, especially when administering high-dose IV diuretics, precise monitoring of urine output is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. An indwelling urinary catheter allows for accurate, hourly measurement, which is necessary for guiding treatment."
            },

                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's SpO2 of 89% indicates significant hypoxemia despite being on 2 L/min of oxygen. Increasing the oxygen delivery is a critical immediate action to improve tissue oxygenation, reduce the work of breathing, and decrease myocardial oxygen demand."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While an ACE inhibitor like lisinopril is a cornerstone of chronic HFrEF management, its administration is not an immediate priority during acute decompensation. The focus is on diuresis and preload/afterload reduction with IV medications. Oral medications have a slower onset, and there is a risk of hypotension or worsening renal function in the acute phase."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. Initiating an IV nitroglycerin infusion is an immediate priority for a client with ADHF and elevated blood pressure. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that reduces both preload (venous return) and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), which decreases the workload on the failing heart and helps resolve pulmonary edema."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Client education is a vital component of heart failure management but is not appropriate when the client is in acute respiratory distress. The nurse's immediate priority is to implement life-saving physiological interventions. Education can be provided once the client is stable and able to participate."
