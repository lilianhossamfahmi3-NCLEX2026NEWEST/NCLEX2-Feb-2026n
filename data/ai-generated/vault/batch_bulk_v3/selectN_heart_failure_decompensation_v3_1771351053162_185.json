        "rationale": "**Correct.** Administering furosemide 80 mg IV push is a priority. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, leading to rapid diuresis. This reduces circulating blood volume (preload), alleviating pulmonary congestion and improving oxygenation. In ADHF, the failing heart cannot effectively pump blood forward, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs. Diuretics like furosemide are crucial to remove excess fluid and ease the workload on the heart. The rapid onset of IV furosemide (typically within 5-10 minutes) makes it ideal for acute situations. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor potassium levels closely, as furosemide can cause hypokalemia, which can exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias.",

        "rationale": "**Correct.** Placing the client in high-Fowler's position is an immediate, non-pharmacological intervention to improve oxygenation. This position uses gravity to reduce venous return to the heart (preload), decreasing pulmonary congestion. It also allows for maximum diaphragmatic excursion and lung expansion, easing the work of breathing. In heart failure, the increased preload overwhelms the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to fluid back-up into the lungs. High-Fowler's position helps to alleviate this pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Ensure the client's comfort and prevent skin breakdown by repositioning frequently and using pressure-reducing devices.",

The priority is to stabilize the client's respiratory and hemodynamic status. This can be done once the client is more stable. Weighing the client at this moment will not provide immediate relief from the acute symptoms. **Clinical Pearl:** Consistent daily weights should be obtained at the same time each day, using the same scale, and with the client wearing similar clothing.",

An indwelling urinary catheter allows for accurate, hourly measurement, which is necessary for guiding treatment. Monitoring urine output helps the nurse titrate the diuretic dose and prevent over-diuresis or under-diuresis. Inadequate urine output may indicate renal hypoperfusion, while excessive output can lead to electrolyte imbalances. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and practice strict aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance.",

Increasing the oxygen delivery is a critical immediate action to improve tissue oxygenation, reduce the work of breathing, and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Hypoxemia in heart failure is primarily due to pulmonary edema, which impairs gas exchange in the alveoli. Increasing the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) helps to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, driving more oxygen into the bloodstream. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client's respiratory status closely after increasing oxygen, and be prepared to escalate oxygen delivery methods (e.g., non-rebreather mask, BiPAP) if needed.",

The focus is on diuresis and preload/afterload reduction with IV medications. Oral medications have a slower onset, and there is a risk of hypotension or worsening renal function in the acute phase. In ADHF, the priority is to stabilize the client's hemodynamics and respiratory status quickly. Oral medications are less predictable in their absorption and onset of action compared to IV medications. **Clinical Pearl:** ACE inhibitors should be initiated or adjusted cautiously in the acute setting, especially if the client is hypotensive or has impaired renal function.",

Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that reduces both preload (venous return) and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), which decreases the workload on the failing heart and helps resolve pulmonary edema. By dilating veins, nitroglycerin reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart (preload), decreasing pulmonary congestion. By dilating arteries, it reduces the resistance the heart has to pump against (afterload), improving cardiac output. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood pressure closely during nitroglycerin infusion, as hypotension is a common side effect. Titrate the infusion rate carefully to achieve the desired hemodynamic effect.",

The nurse's immediate priority is to implement life-saving physiological interventions. Education can be provided once the client is stable and able to participate. The client's ability to comprehend and retain information is significantly impaired when they are experiencing acute respiratory distress. **Clinical Pearl:** Tailor education to the client's individual needs and learning style, and provide written materials for reinforcement.",
