    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of lithium toxicity. A serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L is significantly above the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L), indicating toxicity. The neurological assessment reveals confusion, ataxia, and coarse hand tremors, which are classic signs of lithium-induced neurotoxicity. The client's report of severe nausea and blurred vision further supports this diagnosis, as blurred vision can result from lithium's effects on the central nervous system. Hyponatremia (serum sodium of 129 mEq/L) exacerbates lithium toxicity because the kidneys compensate by reabsorbing more lithium, leading to increased serum levels. Gastroenteritis-induced dehydration contributes to this process by reducing renal clearance of lithium. Immediate interventions include withholding lithium, notifying the provider, administering IV fluids to promote lithium excretion, and monitoring neurological status closely. Hemodialysis may be necessary in severe cases.",
    "incorrect": "While hypotension (blood pressure 102/64 mmHg) and elevated heart rate (104/min) are concerning, they are likely secondary to dehydration from gastroenteritis and are less specific indicators of lithium toxicity than the neurological and laboratory findings. A low-grade fever (99.0°F or 37.2°C) is also likely related to the gastroenteritis. The serum creatinine and heart rate values from Day 1 represent the client's baseline and are not indicative of the current acute situation. The focus should be on the cluster of cues on Day 3 that point directly to severe neurotoxicity and its underlying cause.",
