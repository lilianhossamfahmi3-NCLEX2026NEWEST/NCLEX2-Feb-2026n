    "correct": "The client presents with severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Na+ 118 mEq/L) secondary to SIADH, a common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer. In SIADH, excessive ADH leads to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. The priority is client safety due to the high risk of cerebral edema, which can lead to seizures; therefore, seizure precautions are essential to prevent injury. The primary treatment for SIADH is fluid restriction (typically 500-1000 mL/day) to correct the dilutional hyponatremia by preventing further free water intake and allowing the body to excrete excess water. To actively and safely raise the serum sodium in a symptomatic patient, a hypertonic solution like 3% sodium chloride is administered cautiously (typically at a rate of 0.5-1 mEq/L/hour) to shift fluid out of the brain cells, reducing cerebral edema. Rapid correction can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. Demeclocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is used to inhibit the effect of ADH on the renal tubules, which induces a state of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and promotes free water excretion. This is typically used for chronic SIADH management.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options reflect a misunderstanding of SIADH pathophysiology and management. Droplet or bleeding precautions are irrelevant as SIADH is an endocrine, not infectious or hematologic, disorder. Sodium restriction or encouraging fluids would worsen the hyponatremia. Hypotonic (0.45% NaCl) or free-water solutions (D5W) are contraindicated as they would exacerbate cerebral edema and lower sodium levels further. Desmopressin is a synthetic ADH and would worsen SIADH by increasing water retention. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and not the primary agent for antagonizing ADH effects. While diuretics like furosemide may be used in conjunction with hypertonic saline, they are not the first-line treatment and require careful monitoring of electrolytes.",
