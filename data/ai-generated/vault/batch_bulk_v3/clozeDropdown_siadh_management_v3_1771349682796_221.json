        "correct": "The client presents with severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Na+ 118 mEq/L) secondary to SIADH, a common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer. The priority is safety due to the high risk of cerebral edema, which can lead to seizures; therefore, seizure precautions are essential. The primary treatment for SIADH is fluid restriction to correct the dilutional hyponatremia by preventing further free water intake. To actively and safely raise the serum sodium in a symptomatic patient, a hypertonic solution like 3% sodium chloride is administered cautiously to shift fluid out of the brain cells. Demeclocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is used to inhibit the effect of ADH on the renal tubules, which induces a state of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and promotes free water excretion.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options reflect misunderstanding of SIADH pathophysiology and management. Droplet or bleeding precautions are irrelevant as SIADH is an endocrine, not infectious or hematologic, disorder. Sodium restriction or encouraging fluids would worsen the hyponatremia. Hypotonic (0.45% NaCl) or free-water solutions (D5W) are contraindicated as they would exacerbate cerebral edema and lower sodium levels further. Desmopressin is a synthetic ADH and would worsen SIADH. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and not the primary agent for antagonizing ADH effects.",
