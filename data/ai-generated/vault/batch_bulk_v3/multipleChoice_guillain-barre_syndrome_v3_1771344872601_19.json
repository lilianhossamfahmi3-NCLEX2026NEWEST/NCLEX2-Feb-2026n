      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "This statement describes the hallmark presentation of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS): acute, ascending, and relatively symmetrical paresthesia (tingling) and weakness. The syndrome typically begins in the distal lower extremities and progresses proximally (ascending) over hours to days. This pattern is caused by an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. This demyelination disrupts nerve signal transmission, leading to muscle weakness and sensory disturbances. The preceding gastroenteritis is a common trigger, as molecular mimicry can occur where antibodies developed against the infectious agent cross-react with nerve tissue.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Early recognition of ascending weakness is crucial. Monitor respiratory function closely as ascending paralysis can affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to respiratory failure. Assess cranial nerve function, especially swallowing, to prevent aspiration.",

    "B": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "This statement describes fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, particularly involving ptosis (drooping eyelids). This pattern is characteristic of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, not the peripheral nerve myelin as in GBS. In MG, antibodies block or destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing muscle contraction. The fluctuating weakness is due to the depletion of available acetylcholine receptors with repeated muscle use.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Myasthenia Gravis weakness often improves with rest and worsens with repetitive movements. Edrophonium (Tensilon) test can be used to diagnose MG by temporarily improving muscle strength.",

    "C": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "This statement describes a descending pattern of paralysis, starting with cranial nerves (vision, swallowing) and moving downward. This is the classic presentation of botulism, a neurotoxic illness, which is a key differential diagnosis to GBS but has an opposite progression. Botulism is caused by the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, which blocks the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to flaccid paralysis. The descending pattern is due to the toxin affecting cranial nerves first.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Botulism often presents with the '4 Ds': Diplopia (double vision), Dysarthria (difficulty speaking), Dysphonia (hoarse voice), and Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Antitoxin administration is crucial in botulism treatment.",

    "D": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "This statement describes the acute, unilateral onset of neurological deficits, including facial numbness, arm weakness, and slurred speech. This is highly suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), which involves a focal lesion in the central nervous system (brain), not the diffuse, symmetrical peripheral neuropathy seen in GBS. A stroke occurs when blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted, leading to neuronal damage and neurological deficits. The specific symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Remember the acronym FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) to quickly assess for stroke symptoms. Immediate medical attention is crucial in stroke to minimize brain damage.",
