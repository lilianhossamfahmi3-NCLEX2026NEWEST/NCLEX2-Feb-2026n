The child has a productive cough with thick, yellow-green sputum, diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Which nursing interventions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The appropriate plan of care for a child with a CF exacerbation focuses on airway clearance, nutritional support, and management of malabsorption. This includes performing CPT before meals to prevent vomiting, providing a high-calorie/protein/fat diet to meet increased metabolic needs and counteract malabsorption, administering pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion, and using mucolytics like dornase alfa to thin secretions.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that would be detrimental include administering cough suppressants, which would lead to retained secretions, and restricting fluids, which would thicken secretions. Both actions would worsen the child's respiratory status.",

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. The cough in a client with CF is a protective, productive mechanism to clear thick, tenacious mucus from the airways. Suppressing the cough would lead to retained secretions, increased risk of infection, and worsening airway obstruction."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is correct. CPT is a cornerstone of airway clearance therapy in CF. Performing it before meals is crucial because the percussion and postural changes can induce nausea and vomiting if done on a full stomach. This timing maximizes secretion clearance while minimizing the risk of aspiration and discomfort."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is correct. Pancreatic insufficiency in CF causes malabsorption of fats, proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins. Clients have increased metabolic demands, especially during an exacerbation. A diet high in calories (110-200% of RDA), protein, and fat is essential to promote adequate growth, maintain weight, and fight infection."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is correct. Due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, clients with CF cannot digest food properly without supplemental enzymes. These enzymes must be taken with every meal and snack to facilitate the absorption of nutrients, particularly fats and proteins, and prevent steatorrhea and malnutrition."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. Clients with CF, especially during a pulmonary exacerbation, require increased fluid intake. Adequate hydration helps to decrease the viscosity of respiratory secretions, making them easier to mobilize and expectorate with CPT and coughing."

                "explanation": "This is correct. Dornase alfa is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) that specifically cleaves the extracellular DNA from neutrophils found in purulent CF sputum. This action decreases the viscoelasticity of the sputum, improving airway clearance and lung function."
