  "question": "The nurse is developing the plan of care for a 10-year-old child admitted at 1400 with a cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbation. The child has a productive cough with thick, yellow-green sputum, diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Which nursing interventions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The plan of care for a CF exacerbation prioritizes airway clearance, nutritional support, and managing malabsorption. CPT before meals prevents vomiting. A high-calorie, high-protein, high-fat diet addresses increased metabolic needs and malabsorption. Pancreatic enzymes aid digestion. Dornase alfa thins secretions.",
    "incorrect": "Cough suppressants worsen respiratory status by preventing expectoration of secretions. Fluid restriction thickens secretions, hindering airway clearance.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Administer cough suppressants as needed for persistent coughing.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Cough suppressants are contraindicated. In CF, the cough is vital for clearing thick mucus. Suppressing it leads to mucus plugging, increasing infection risk and airway obstruction. This can cause atelectasis and further compromise gas exchange. Clinical Pearl: Never suppress a productive cough in CF unless specifically ordered by the provider for a specific reason (e.g., severe sleep disruption)."

        "label": "B",
        "content": "Perform chest physiotherapy (CPT) 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. CPT is essential for airway clearance. Performing it 30 minutes before meals prevents nausea and vomiting. The percussion and postural drainage help mobilize secretions from the lungs into the larger airways for expectoration. Bedtime CPT helps clear secretions accumulated during the day. Pathophysiology: CFTR gene mutation causes abnormal chloride transport, leading to thick, sticky mucus in the lungs. CPT helps dislodge this mucus. Clinical Pearl: Coordinate CPT with nebulizer treatments for optimal airway clearance. Administer bronchodilators before CPT to open airways."

        "content": "Ensure the child receives a high-calorie, high-protein, and high-fat diet.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. CF causes pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption, especially of fats. Clients with CF have increased metabolic demands due to chronic infection and inflammation. A high-calorie (110-200% of RDA), high-protein, and high-fat diet is crucial for growth, weight maintenance, and fighting infection. Pathophysiology: Pancreatic enzyme deficiency prevents proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. Clinical Pearl: Consult a registered dietitian for individualized nutritional recommendations. Consider supplemental tube feedings if oral intake is insufficient."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Administer pancreatic enzymes with all meals and snacks.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Pancreatic enzymes are essential for digesting food due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. They must be taken with every meal and snack to facilitate nutrient absorption, particularly fats and proteins, and prevent steatorrhea (fatty stools) and malnutrition. Pathophysiology: CFTR mutation affects pancreatic enzyme production and secretion. Clinical Pearl: Adjust enzyme dosage based on stool consistency and fat content. If steatorrhea persists, the dosage may need to be increased (within safe limits)."

        "label": "E",
        "content": "Restrict oral fluid intake to 1000 mL per 24 hours.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Fluid restriction is harmful. Clients with CF, especially during exacerbations, need increased fluid intake to thin respiratory secretions, making them easier to mobilize and expectorate. Dehydration worsens mucus viscosity. Clinical Pearl: Encourage frequent sips of water or electrolyte-containing fluids. Monitor urine output and hydration status. Pathophysiology: Adequate hydration reduces the viscosity of mucus by increasing the water content, facilitating mucociliary clearance."

        "label": "F",
        "content": "Administer dornase alfa via nebulizer as prescribed.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is a mucolytic that breaks down extracellular DNA in CF sputum, thinning secretions and improving airway clearance. It reduces sputum viscosity and improves lung function. Pathophysiology: Neutrophils release DNA into the airways during infection and inflammation, contributing to the thickness of CF sputum. Dornase alfa cleaves this DNA. Clinical Pearl: Administer dornase alfa after bronchodilators and CPT for optimal effect. Monitor for voice alterations and pharyngitis."
