    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 58-year-old client who is 24 hours postoperative following a bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome. The client suddenly becomes confused, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 82/48 mmHg, and tachycardic with a heart rate of 122/min. The nurse notes cool, clammy skin. The nurse should perform the following actions in what order of priority? Drag and drop the options below into the correct sequence, with the highest priority action at the top.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of an acute adrenal crisis (Addisonian crisis), a life-threatening complication following bilateral adrenalectomy. This condition is characterized by a profound deficiency of glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), leading to circulatory collapse, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The priority of actions follows the principle of treating the most life-threatening problems first. The sequence is: 1) Administer IV hydrocortisone to correct the underlying hormonal deficiency. 2) Infuse isotonic fluids to treat hypovolemic shock. 3) Administer dextrose to reverse life-threatening hypoglycemia causing neurologic changes. 4) Notify the RRT to bring critical care expertise to the bedside. 5) Place on a cardiac monitor to detect lethal arrhythmias. 6) Check potassium to guide further electrolyte management.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect sequence of actions could delay life-saving treatment. For instance, checking potassium or notifying the provider before administering hydrocortisone and fluids fails to immediately address the root cause of the shock and the circulatory collapse. While all actions are important, delaying the administration of steroids, fluids, and glucose in favor of diagnostic measures or less direct interventions can result in irreversible organ damage or death.",
