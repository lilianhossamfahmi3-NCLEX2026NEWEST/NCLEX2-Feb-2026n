    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of an acute adrenal crisis (Addisonian crisis), a life-threatening complication following bilateral adrenalectomy. This condition is characterized by a profound deficiency of glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), leading to circulatory collapse, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The priority of actions follows the principle of treating the most life-threatening problems first. The sequence is: 1) Administer IV hydrocortisone to correct the underlying hormonal deficiency. 2) Infuse isotonic fluids to treat hypovolemic shock. 3) Administer dextrose to reverse life-threatening hypoglycemia causing neurologic changes. 4) Notify the RRT to bring critical care expertise to the bedside. 5) Place on a cardiac monitor to detect lethal arrhythmias. 6) Check potassium to guide further electrolyte management.",
    "incorrect": "An incorrect sequence of actions could delay life-saving treatment. For instance, checking potassium or notifying the provider before administering hydrocortisone and fluids fails to immediately address the root cause of the shock and the circulatory collapse.

        "correctRationale": "Administer IV hydrocortisone 100 mg as prescribed. This is the highest priority because it is the definitive treatment for acute adrenal crisis. Replacing the deficient cortisol addresses the underlying cause of vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and metabolic dysfunction, and is essential for stabilizing the client. Glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone bind to intracellular receptors, modulating gene expression and increasing the synthesis of proteins involved in glucose metabolism, immune function, and blood pressure regulation. In adrenal crisis, the lack of cortisol leads to unopposed vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, resulting in hypotension and shock.",
        "incorrectRationale": "Delaying hydrocortisone administration will prolong the adrenal crisis and worsen the client's condition. Without cortisol replacement, the client's vasodilation and capillary permeability will continue, leading to worsening hypotension and potential organ damage."

Rapid volume expansion is critical to restore tissue perfusion and prevent multi-organ system failure. In adrenal crisis, the deficiency of mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) leads to sodium and water loss, contributing to hypovolemia. Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) replaces the lost volume and helps to restore blood pressure.",

Cortisol is necessary for gluconeogenesis. Reversing severe hypoglycemia is a critical priority to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver, ensuring adequate glucose supply to the brain. In adrenal crisis, the lack of cortisol leads to impaired gluconeogenesis and hypoglycemia, which can cause neurological dysfunction.",

The RRT can provide advanced airway management, vasopressor support, and continuous monitoring to stabilize the client.",

This is the next priority because adrenal crisis can cause hyperkalemia (due to aldosterone deficiency), and severe hemodynamic instability can precipitate life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous monitoring is a crucial safety measure for early detection. Aldosterone promotes potassium excretion in the kidneys. In adrenal crisis, the lack of aldosterone leads to potassium retention and hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias.",
        "incorrectRationale": "Delaying cardiac monitoring will delay detection of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia can cause peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and widened QRS complex, which can progress to ventricular fibrillation or asystole."

The potassium level will help guide further treatment decisions, such as the need for potassium-lowering medications or dialysis.",
        "incorrectRationale": "Checking potassium level before stabilizing the client's hemodynamics and hormone levels will delay critical interventions. While important, the potassium level is not the immediate priority in this life-threatening situation. Stabilizing the client's blood pressure, hormone levels, and glucose are more critical."

  "clinicalPearl": "Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate treatment with IV glucocorticoids, fluid resuscitation, and glucose administration. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage and death. Remember the 'Rule of 100s': 100mg hydrocortisone, 1000mL NS, and blood glucose <100mg/dL, give D50.  Also, consider the time of day.  Cortisol levels are normally highest in the morning (around 0800) and lowest at night (around 2400).  This diurnal variation is lost in Cushing's syndrome, and its absence post-adrenalectomy contributes to the crisis.",
