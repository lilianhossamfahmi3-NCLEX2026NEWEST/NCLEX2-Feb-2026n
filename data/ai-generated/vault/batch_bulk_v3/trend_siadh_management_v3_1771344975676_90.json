An increase in serum sodium (from 121 to 128 mEq/L) demonstrates a reduction in free water retention and a move towards normalization. A decrease in urine specific gravity (from 1.032 to 1.018) indicates the urine is becoming less concentrated, meaning the kidneys are appropriately excreting free water. A decrease in daily weight (from 78.5 kg to 77.0 kg) directly reflects the loss of excess retained fluid. These three trends together confirm that the prescribed fluid restriction is effective.",

Persistent lethargy is a negative neurologic sign associated with hyponatremia and cerebral edema, not an improvement. The initial blood pressure of 148/90 mmHg is a sign of the fluid volume excess present on admission, not an indicator of improvement.",
