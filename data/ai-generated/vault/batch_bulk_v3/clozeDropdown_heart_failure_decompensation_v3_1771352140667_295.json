        "correct": "The correct plan of care addresses the life-threatening issues of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the proper sequence. The priority is correcting hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) with supplemental oxygen, following the Airway-Breathing-Circulation (ABC) framework. Next, intravenous furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is administered to rapidly reduce the severe fluid overload (preload) causing pulmonary congestion. Intravenous nitroglycerin is the appropriate choice to decrease both preload and afterload in a client with ADHF and hypertension, thereby reducing the workload on the heart. Aggressive diuresis with furosemide necessitates vigilant monitoring of serum potassium due to the high risk of life-threatening hypokalemia. Finally, placing the client in a High-Fowler's position with legs dependent uses gravity to reduce venous return to the heart (preload) and maximize thoracic expansion, which eases the work of breathing.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices reflect actions that are either not the immediate priority, are contraindicated, or are less effective for managing ADHF. For instance, oral medications have a slower onset than IV medications required in an acute setting. Administering fluids or beta-blockers can worsen the decompensation. While monitoring weight and glucose are important aspects of care, preventing acute electrolyte imbalances that can cause cardiac dysrhythmias is a higher priority. Positioning the client flat or with legs elevated would increase venous return, exacerbating pulmonary edema and dyspnea.",
