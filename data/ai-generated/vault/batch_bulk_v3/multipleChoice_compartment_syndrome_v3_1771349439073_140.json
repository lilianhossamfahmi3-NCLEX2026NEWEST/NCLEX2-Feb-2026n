  "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the medical-surgical unit following a motorcycle accident that resulted in a closed comminuted fracture of the right tibia. A fiberglass cast was applied in the emergency department. Eight hours after cast application, the nurse performs an assessment. The client reports a deep, throbbing pain in the right lower leg, rating it a 10/10, stating, 'The morphine isn't touching it at all.' The nurse observes that the client's right toes are pale, swollen, and cool to the touch. Passive dorsiflexion of the right ankle elicits an extreme pain response from the client. Based on this cluster of findings, which condition should the nurse suspect is developing?",

      "rationale": "The nurse should suspect compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure within a muscle compartment increases, compromising circulation and nerve function. In this case, the fracture and cast application have likely caused swelling within the confined space of the lower leg. The '6 Ps' are classic signs: Pain (severe, unrelieved by analgesics), Paresthesia (numbness/tingling), Pallor (paleness), Pulselessness (weak or absent pulse - a late sign), Paralysis (weakness or inability to move - a late sign), and Pressure (tense compartment). The extreme pain with passive dorsiflexion (pain with passive stretch) is a highly sensitive indicator. The pathophysiology involves increased pressure exceeding capillary perfusion pressure, leading to ischemia, muscle and nerve damage, and potentially irreversible tissue necrosis if untreated. Immediate intervention, such as fasciotomy, is crucial to relieve the pressure and restore blood flow. ClinicalPearl: Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by opioids is the HALLMARK early sign of compartment syndrome.",
      "sbar": "S: 45-year-old male, post motorcycle accident with right tibia fracture and cast application. Reports severe pain (10/10) unrelieved by morphine. O: Right toes pale, swollen, cool. Extreme pain with passive dorsiflexion. A: Suspect acute compartment syndrome. R: Notify the physician immediately for potential fasciotomy. Monitor neurovascular status every hour. Keep the leg at heart level. Do NOT elevate above heart level or apply ice, as this can further reduce arterial perfusion. 1600: Notified physician of findings. Orders received for STAT surgical consult and pain management. 1615: Surgical team evaluating patient. 1630: Patient prepped for OR."

        "rationale": "DVT is less likely given the pallor and coolness. DVT typically presents with unilateral edema, warmth, erythema, and calf pain due to venous obstruction and inflammation. While pain may be present, it's usually a dull ache, not the severe, unrelenting pain described. The pathophysiology of DVT involves thrombus formation in a deep vein, obstructing venous return and causing inflammation. ClinicalPearl: Assess for Homan's sign (pain on dorsiflexion of the foot) in DVT, although this is not a reliable indicator.",

        "rationale": "FES is unlikely as the symptoms are localized, not systemic. FES typically occurs 24-72 hours post-injury and presents with respiratory distress (hypoxemia), neurological changes (confusion, restlessness), and a petechial rash. The pathophysiology involves fat globules released from the bone marrow entering the circulation, causing capillary blockage and inflammation in the lungs and brain. ClinicalPearl: Petechiae are a key distinguishing feature of FES.",

        "rationale": "Acute osteomyelitis is less likely given the rapid onset and neurovascular compromise. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection, usually caused by bacteria. While it can cause severe pain, swelling, and warmth, it typically develops over days, not hours. Systemic signs of infection (fever, chills) are also expected. The pathophysiology involves bacterial invasion of the bone, leading to inflammation, bone destruction, and potentially abscess formation. ClinicalPearl: Bone biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis.",
