    "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the medical-surgical unit following a motorcycle accident that resulted in a closed comminuted fracture of the right tibia. A fiberglass cast was applied in the emergency department. Eight hours after cast application, the nurse performs an assessment. The client reports a deep, throbbing pain in the right lower leg, rating it a 10/10, stating, 'The morphine isn't touching it at all.' The nurse observes that the client's right toes are pale, swollen, and cool to the touch. Passive dorsiflexion of the right ankle elicits an extreme pain response from the client. Based on this cluster of findings, which condition should the nurse suspect is developing?",

            "rationale": "The nurse is analyzing a cluster of cues that are the cardinal signs of acute compartment syndrome. These include: 1) Pain out of proportion to the injury and unrelieved by opioids (a key early sign). 2) Paresthesia (not explicitly stated but often follows severe pain). 3) Pallor and coolness, indicating decreased arterial perfusion. 4) Pulselessness (a late sign). 5) Paralysis (a late sign). 6) Pressure, indicated by the swelling within the cast. The pain on passive stretch (dorsiflexion of the ankle) is a classic and highly specific finding. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent permanent muscle and nerve damage."

                "rationale": "While DVT is a risk after a lower extremity fracture, the clinical presentation is different. DVT typically presents with unilateral edema, warmth, erythema (redness), and a dull, aching pain or cramping in the calf. The client's findings of coolness and pallor are inconsistent with the inflammatory response seen in DVT."

                "rationale": "Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is a systemic complication of long bone fractures, typically occurring 24-72 hours post-injury. Its classic triad of symptoms includes respiratory distress (hypoxemia), neurological changes (confusion, restlessness), and a petechial rash on the chest, axillae, and conjunctiva. The client's symptoms are localized to the injured limb, not systemic."

                "rationale": "Acute Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. While it can cause severe pain, swelling, and warmth at the site, its onset is typically not as rapid (within 8 hours). It is more common with open fractures. Furthermore, systemic signs of infection like fever and chills would be expected. The neurovascular compromise signs (pallor, coolness, pain with passive stretch) are not characteristic of a primary bone infection but rather of increased compartmental pressure."
