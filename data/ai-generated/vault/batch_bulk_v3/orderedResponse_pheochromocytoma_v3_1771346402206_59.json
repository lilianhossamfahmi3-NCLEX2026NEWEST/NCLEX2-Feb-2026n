        "introduction": "The client is experiencing severe hypotension and compensatory tachycardia, a common and life-threatening complication following the removal of a pheochromocytoma. The sudden withdrawal of excessive catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) leads to vasodilation and a sharp drop in blood pressure. The nurse must prioritize actions to restore hemodynamic stability.",

            {
                "optionId": "opt_1",
                "text": "Place the client in a modified Trendelenburg position.",
                "explanation": "This is the first and most immediate action. It is a rapid, non-pharmacological intervention that uses gravity to increase venous return to the central circulation and improve perfusion to vital organs, particularly the brain. This can be done while other interventions are being prepared and is a key initial step in managing severe hypotension."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "text": "Increase the rate of the 0.9% sodium chloride infusion.",
                "explanation": "After immediate positioning, the next step is to address the underlying cause of hypotension, which is vasodilation and potential fluid shifts. Increasing the rate of an isotonic IV fluid bolus, as per standing orders, helps to expand intravascular volume and increase blood pressure. This is a foundational treatment for hypovolemic and distributive shock states."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "text": "Administer a prescribed vasopressor medication intravenously.",
                "explanation": "Following fluid resuscitation, if the client remains severely hypotensive, pharmacological support is necessary. The removal of the pheochromocytoma has caused a precipitous drop in catecholamines, leading to vasodilation. A vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine) is required to mimic the effect of these catecholamines, induce vasoconstriction, and raise the mean arterial pressure to an acceptable level."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "text": "Obtain a point-of-care blood glucose level.",
                "explanation": "Once immediate hemodynamic instability is being addressed, the nurse must assess for another critical post-operative complication: hypoglycemia. The high levels of catecholamines from the tumor suppressed insulin secretion. After tumor removal, insulin levels can rebound sharply, leading to a rapid drop in blood glucose. While hypotension is the more immediate life threat, hypoglycemia must be identified and treated promptly to prevent neurological damage."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "text": "Reassess the client's blood pressure and heart rate.",
                "explanation": "This is the final step in the sequence and represents the evaluation phase of the nursing process. After implementing multiple interventions (positioning, fluids, vasopressors), the nurse must continuously monitor the client's response to determine if the actions were effective and if further intervention is required. This is crucial for ongoing management and titration of therapies."
