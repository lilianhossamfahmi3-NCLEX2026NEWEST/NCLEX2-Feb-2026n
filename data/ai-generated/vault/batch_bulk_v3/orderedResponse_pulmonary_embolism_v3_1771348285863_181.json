The first action is to place the client in a high-Fowler's position to maximize lung expansion and ease the work of breathing. The second priority is to apply high-flow oxygen to correct the severe hypoxemia caused by the ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Once these initial stabilizing actions are taken, the nurse must immediately activate the Rapid Response Team to bring critical care resources to the bedside. Following this, obtaining a full set of vital signs provides a crucial baseline for the responding team. Finally, establishing IV access is necessary to prepare for the administration of anticoagulants, fluids, or other emergency medications that will be ordered.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence delays critical interventions. For example, obtaining vital signs or establishing IV access before positioning the client and applying oxygen would prolong the period of severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress, potentially leading to respiratory arrest. While activating the RRT is vital, it is performed after the nurse has initiated the two quickest interventions (positioning and oxygen) that can immediately benefit the client's oxygenation status.",
