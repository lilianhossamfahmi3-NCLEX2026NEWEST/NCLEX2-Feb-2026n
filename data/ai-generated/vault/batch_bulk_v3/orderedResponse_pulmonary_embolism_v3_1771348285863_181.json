    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions for a client experiencing a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Placing the client in high-Fowler's position maximizes lung expansion, reducing the work of breathing. Applying high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask addresses the severe hypoxemia caused by ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to areas of the lung being ventilated but not perfused, thus decreasing oxygen uptake. Activating the Rapid Response Team (RRT) brings critical care expertise to the bedside. Obtaining vital signs provides a baseline for the RRT. Establishing IV access prepares for administering anticoagulants (e.g., heparin), fluids, or thrombolytics.",
    "incorrect": "Any other sequence delays critical interventions. Obtaining vital signs or establishing IV access before positioning and oxygenating prolongs hypoxemia and respiratory distress, potentially leading to respiratory arrest. While activating the RRT is vital, it follows the quickest interventions (positioning and oxygen) that immediately benefit oxygenation. Delaying high-flow oxygen can lead to worsening hypoxemia, cellular hypoxia, and potential organ damage. Delaying high-Fowler's can increase the work of breathing and exacerbate respiratory distress.",

A non-rebreather mask delivers the highest possible concentration of supplemental oxygen (up to 100%), increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and driving more oxygen into the blood."

The client will require IV access for administering an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin bolus and infusion) to prevent further clot propagation, fluids to support blood pressure if hypotensive, or potentially thrombolytic therapy to dissolve the clot. This is performed once immediate stabilization and escalation have been addressed."
