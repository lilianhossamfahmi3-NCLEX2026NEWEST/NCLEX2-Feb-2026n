The underlying cause is shallow breathing due to significant incisional pain (7/10), which prevents full lung expansion. Therefore, the priority nursing actions are to manage the pain (administer morphine) to enable effective respiratory exercises and to physically facilitate lung expansion by positioning the client in high-Fowler's. The nurse must monitor for improvement in gas exchange (oxygen saturation) and work of breathing (respiratory rate and effort). If atelectasis is not reversed, retained secretions can lead to pneumonia, and progressive alveolar collapse can result in acute respiratory failure.",

Incorrect parameters to monitor are not direct indicators of respiratory status in this context (incisional drainage, blood pressure, bowel sounds). Incorrect complications are either less likely based on the specific cues (pulmonary embolism), a more distant consequence (sepsis), or unrelated to the respiratory system (wound dehiscence).",
