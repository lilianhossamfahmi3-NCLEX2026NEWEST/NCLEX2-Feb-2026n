Shallow breathing from incisional pain (7/10) prevents full lung expansion. Administering morphine manages pain, enabling respiratory exercises. High-Fowler's position facilitates lung expansion. Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory rate/effort for improvement. Untreated atelectasis can lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Atelectasis occurs when alveoli collapse due to hypoventilation, often post-surgery due to pain, anesthesia, and immobility. This collapse impairs gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia. Retained secretions further exacerbate the condition, increasing the risk of infection.",

Incorrect parameters aren't direct indicators of respiratory status (incisional drainage, blood pressure, bowel sounds).
