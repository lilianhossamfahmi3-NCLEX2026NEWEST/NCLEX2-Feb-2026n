            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "While BPH is a significant risk factor for urinary retention and subsequent urinary tract infections (a common source of sepsis), it is a chronic condition and part of the client's past medical history. It is not an acute clinical cue that indicates the client is currently septic."

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20/min) is a SIRS criterion. It represents the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis by blowing off carbon dioxide and is a sign of systemic distress associated with sepsis."

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "A MAP below 70 mmHg indicates inadequate tissue and organ perfusion. This finding suggests the client is developing shock, a life-threatening component of severe sepsis (septic shock)."

        "Cloudy, malodorous urine in catheter bag": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "This finding is highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is the likely source of infection. However, it indicates a localized infection, not the systemic response of sepsis itself. A client can have a UTI without being septic. The question asks for cues of sepsis, not the source of infection."

        "Temperature 36.1°C (97.0°F)": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "While fever is common in sepsis, hypothermia (temperature < 36°C) is also a significant SIRS criterion. It often occurs in older adults or immunocompromised individuals and indicates a severe, dysregulated immune response. This is a crucial cue for sepsis."

        "Recent onset of confusion": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "An acute change in mental status is a hallmark of sepsis-induced end-organ dysfunction. It indicates that the brain is not receiving adequate perfusion or is being affected by systemic inflammation and toxins. This is a critical sign of worsening sepsis."
