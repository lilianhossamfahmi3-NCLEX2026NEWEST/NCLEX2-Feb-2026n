  "stem": "The nurse is reviewing the admission data for a 68-year-old male client brought from a long-term care facility. The client has an indwelling urinary catheter. The nurse is concerned about the client developing sepsis. Which of the following findings should the nurse recognize as most concerning for sepsis? Select all that apply.",

    "Heart rate 118/min": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Tachycardia (heart rate > 90/min) is a key criterion for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and a common compensatory mechanism for hypotension and hypovolemia in sepsis. In sepsis, the body attempts to increase cardiac output to maintain tissue perfusion. The release of inflammatory mediators and activation of the sympathetic nervous system contribute to the elevated heart rate. This finding is a critical cue for sepsis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Sepsis often presents with tachycardia as the body attempts to compensate for decreased perfusion. Monitor heart rate trends closely.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "History of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "While BPH is a significant risk factor for urinary retention and subsequent urinary tract infections (a common source of sepsis), it is a chronic condition and part of the client's past medical history. It is not an acute clinical cue that indicates the client is currently septic. BPH predisposes to UTIs due to incomplete bladder emptying, but the presence of BPH alone doesn't indicate current sepsis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "While BPH increases the risk of UTI, it's not a direct indicator of current sepsis. Focus on acute changes in vital signs and mental status.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "Respiratory rate 24/min": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20/min) is a SIRS criterion. It represents the body's attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis by blowing off carbon dioxide and is a sign of systemic distress associated with sepsis. Sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production, causing metabolic acidosis. The increased respiratory rate is a compensatory mechanism to reduce CO2 levels and raise pH.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Elevated respiratory rate in the context of other concerning signs should prompt immediate assessment for sepsis.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) 67 mmHg": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "A MAP below 70 mmHg indicates inadequate tissue and organ perfusion. This finding suggests the client is developing shock, a life-threatening component of severe sepsis (septic shock). In sepsis, vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, driven by inflammatory mediators like nitric oxide and cytokines, lead to decreased systemic vascular resistance and hypotension. Reduced MAP compromises oxygen delivery to vital organs.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Maintain a MAP of at least 65 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion in sepsis. Intervene promptly if MAP is trending downward.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "Cloudy, malodorous urine in catheter bag": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "This finding is highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is the likely source of infection. However, it indicates a localized infection, not the systemic response of sepsis itself. A client can have a UTI without being septic. The question asks for cues of sepsis, not the source of infection. While the urine suggests infection, sepsis requires a systemic inflammatory response.",
      "clinicalPearl": "While cloudy, malodorous urine suggests a UTI, it doesn't automatically mean the patient is septic. Look for systemic signs of infection.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "Temperature 36.1°C (97.0°F)": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "While fever is common in sepsis, hypothermia (temperature < 36°C) is also a significant SIRS criterion. It often occurs in older adults or immunocompromised individuals and indicates a severe, dysregulated immune response. In sepsis, the body's thermoregulatory center can be overwhelmed, leading to hypothermia. This is a crucial cue for sepsis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Hypothermia in older adults or immunocompromised patients can be a subtle but critical sign of sepsis. Don't overlook it.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "Recent onset of confusion": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "An acute change in mental status is a hallmark of sepsis-induced end-organ dysfunction. It indicates that the brain is not receiving adequate perfusion or is being affected by systemic inflammation and toxins. Sepsis can cause cerebral hypoperfusion due to hypotension and microvascular dysfunction. Inflammatory mediators can also directly affect neuronal function, leading to altered mental status. This is a critical sign of worsening sepsis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Any new onset of confusion, especially in the elderly, should raise suspicion for sepsis. Investigate promptly.",

I recommend immediate initiation of sepsis protocol per hospital policy, including blood cultures, urine culture, antibiotics (after cultures drawn), and fluid resuscitation.

Consider vasopressors if fluid resuscitation is not effective in maintaining MAP > 65 mmHg."
