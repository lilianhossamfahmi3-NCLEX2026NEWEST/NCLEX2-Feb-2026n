These findings indicate increased preload and impaired cardiac output. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, promoting rapid diuresis. This reduces circulating blood volume, decreasing preload and afterload on the heart, and alleviating pulmonary congestion. The rapid onset of action (within minutes via IV route) makes it crucial in managing acute respiratory distress associated with ADHF.",

However, in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the heart's ability to compensate is already compromised. Administering a beta-blocker during this phase can further reduce cardiac output due to its negative inotropic effects (decreased contractility) and negative chronotropic effects (decreased heart rate). This can precipitate or worsen cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Beta-blockers are typically held or the dose is significantly reduced during ADHF until the patient is stabilized with diuretics and other supportive measures.",

In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), pulmonary edema impairs gas exchange, leading to decreased oxygen levels in the blood. Applying oxygen via a non-rebreather mask at 10 L/min delivers a high concentration of oxygen (60-80%), increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and driving more oxygen into the bloodstream. This improves oxygen saturation, reduces the work of breathing, and decreases myocardial oxygen demand, which is crucial in preventing further cardiac damage.",

It also allows for maximum lung expansion by lowering the diaphragm and increasing thoracic space, which can immediately ease the work of breathing and improve gas exchange.
