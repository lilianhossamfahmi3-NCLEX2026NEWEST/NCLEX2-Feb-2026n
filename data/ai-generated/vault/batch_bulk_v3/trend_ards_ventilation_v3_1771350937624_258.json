While the initial goal of increasing PEEP was to improve oxygenation (which it did transiently, raising SpO2 and PaO2 at 1200), this intervention has led to significant negative consequences. The client has become hemodynamically unstable, as shown by the progressive drop in blood pressure and rise in heart rate, indicating that the increased intrathoracic pressure from the high PEEP is impairing venous return and cardiac output. This is further supported by the declining urine output. Additionally, the plateau pressure has risen above the safe limit of 30 cm H2O, signaling decreased lung compliance and a high risk of barotrauma. The worsening respiratory acidosis (falling pH, rising PaCO2) also indicates that overall gas exchange is failing. The combination of hemodynamic compromise, risk of lung injury, and worsening acidosis demonstrates a clear deteriorating trend.",

The term 'Improving' is incorrect because the mild oxygenation benefit is far outweighed by the life-threatening hemodynamic instability and increasing risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

'Stabilizing' is incorrect because the client is moving away from homeostasis, not towards it; key vital signs and lab values are actively deteriorating.",
