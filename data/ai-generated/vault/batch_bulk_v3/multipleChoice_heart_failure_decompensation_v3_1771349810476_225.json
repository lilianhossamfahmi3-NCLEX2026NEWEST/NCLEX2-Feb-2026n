    "questionText": "A 68-year-old male with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. The client’s spouse reports a 10 lb (4.5 kg) weight gain over the last 4 days and mentions, 'He ran out of his water pill prescription and we couldn't get a refill until today.' The nurse assesses bibasilar crackles, jugular venous distention (JVD) at 45 degrees, and 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Vital signs are: BP 158/96 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, RR 26/min, SpO2 90% on room air, Temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F). Based on this information, which hypothesis about the cause of the client's acute decompensation should the nurse prioritize?",

        "correct": "The most likely cause of the client's acute decompensated heart failure is nonadherence to diuretic therapy. The spouse's statement that the client ran out of his 'water pill' (furosemide, a loop diuretic) 4 days ago directly correlates with the onset of symptoms and the significant 10 lb (4.5 kg) weight gain, which represents fluid retention. The clinical signs of volume overload, including worsening dyspnea, bibasilar crackles, JVD, and significant pitting edema, are the classic manifestations of discontinuing essential diuretic medication in a patient with HFrEF.",
        "incorrect": "While an acute myocardial infarction (MI), pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis can all precipitate heart failure decompensation, the available clinical data do not support these as the primary cause. An MI typically presents with chest pain, which is absent. Pneumonia is unlikely given the afebrile state and lack of other infectious signs. While the client's blood pressure is elevated, it does not meet the criteria for a hypertensive crisis, and the profound fluid overload is more directly explained by the missed medication than by the elevated blood pressure alone.",

While an MI can trigger acute heart failure, the client does not report chest pain, diaphoresis, or other classic signs of acute coronary syndrome. The subacute onset of symptoms over several days is more consistent with gradual fluid accumulation than an acute ischemic event.",
