GBS causes demyelination of peripheral nerves, disrupting nerve impulse transmission to respiratory muscles. This leads to weakened contraction and impaired gas exchange. Immediate intervention (e.g., intubation) may be needed.",

While monitoring is needed, this range isn't immediately life-threatening compared to respiratory failure.
