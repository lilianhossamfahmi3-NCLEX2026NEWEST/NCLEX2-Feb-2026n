    "scenario": "A 38-year-old client is admitted to the neurological intensive care unit with a new diagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which developed two weeks after a gastrointestinal infection. The nurse's initial assessment reveals ascending bilateral weakness, now affecting the upper extremities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. The client is receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy.",
    "question": "During a routine assessment four hours later, which finding is most critical for the nurse to recognize and report to the healthcare provider immediately?",
    "options": [
        {
            "id": "opt_04",
            "text": "The client is unable to lift their arms off the bed."
        },

            "text": "The client's heart rate is fluctuating between 55 and 95 beats per minute."
        }
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "opt_02",
    "answerBreakdown": {
        "correct": "Difficulty counting to 10 in a single breath is a simple bedside test that indicates a significant decrease in vital capacity. This is a critical cue for impending respiratory failure due to the ascending paralysis affecting the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which is the most life-threatening complication of GBS. This finding requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory arrest.",
        "distractors": [
            {
                "optionId": "opt_01",
                "rationale": "A mild headache can be a side effect of IVIG infusion or related to meningeal irritation sometimes seen in GBS. While it should be assessed and managed, a 3/10 headache is not as immediately life-threatening as acute respiratory compromise."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_03",
                "rationale": "Heart rate fluctuations (bradycardia and tachycardia) are common in GBS due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. While this requires close monitoring, the range of 55 to 95 bpm does not indicate an immediate life-threatening dysrhythmia compared to the acute threat of respiratory failure."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "rationale": "The inability to lift the arms off the bed indicates the expected progression of ascending paralysis in GBS. While this finding is significant and should be documented as part of tracking the disease's course, it does not represent an immediate threat to life. Respiratory muscle weakness is the priority concern."
