However, for the past few days, I've had several episodes of loose stools. I also feel like my hands are shaking more than usual, which makes it hard to button my shirt. I am always thirsty, but that's nothing new. I have also been feeling unsteady on my feet, almost like the room is spinning a little. My thinking has been feeling a bit foggy, which is frustrating. I've been sleeping about 7 hours a night and my appetite has been fair.\"",

Diarrhea (loose stools), coarse tremors (shaking more than usual), ataxia (feeling unsteady), and confusion (feeling foggy) are classic manifestations of elevated lithium levels. These findings require immediate intervention, including holding the next dose of lithium and obtaining a stat serum lithium level, as toxicity can rapidly progress to a life-threatening state.",
        "incorrect": "Expected side effects of therapeutic lithium use, such as polydipsia (thirst), should not be highlighted as they do not typically indicate toxicity unless accompanied by other signs. Normal or non-specific findings like sleep patterns, appetite, and statements about adherence, while part of a comprehensive assessment, are not direct cues for acute toxicity in this context.",
