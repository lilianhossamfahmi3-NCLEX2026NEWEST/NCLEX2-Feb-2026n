    "body": "A 45-year-old client is brought to the emergency department after being stung by a bee. Initially, the client had localized swelling and urticaria on the chest. Fifteen minutes later, the nurse assesses the client and notes the following: widespread urticaria, swollen lips, audible inspiratory stridor, and the client reports feeling dizzy. Vital signs are BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 28/min, and SpO2 91% on room air. The nurse has established IV access and has standing orders. Which medication should the nurse prioritize for immediate administration?",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction. The key findings are hypotension (BP 88/50), upper airway compromise (swollen lips, inspiratory stridor), and tachycardia (HR 128). Intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line, life-saving intervention. Its alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure and reduces angioedema. Its beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, relieving respiratory distress. It acts rapidly and addresses the most immediate threats to life.",
        "incorrect": "While other medications are used in the management of anaphylaxis, they are considered second-line or adjunctive therapies and do not have the rapid, multi-system effects of epinephrine. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that primarily treats cutaneous symptoms like hives but does not reverse hypotension or airway obstruction. Albuterol addresses lower airway bronchospasm but will not treat the laryngeal edema causing the stridor or the systemic vasodilation causing hypotension. Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, has a slow onset of action (4-6 hours) and is used to prevent a delayed biphasic reaction, not for immediate life support.",
