  "body": "A 45-year-old client is brought to the emergency department (ED) at 1400 after being stung by a bee. Initially, the client had localized swelling and urticaria on the chest. At 1415, the nurse assesses the client and notes the following: widespread urticaria, swollen lips, audible inspiratory stridor, and the client reports feeling dizzy. Vital signs are BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 28/min, and SpO2 91% on room air. The nurse has established IV access and has standing orders. Which medication should the nurse prioritize for immediate administration?",

    "correct": "Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM is the priority. The client is experiencing anaphylactic shock, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. The signs (hypotension, stridor, angioedema, dizziness, urticaria) indicate rapid systemic vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and upper airway obstruction. Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist. Its alpha-1 effects cause vasoconstriction, increasing BP and reducing angioedema. Beta-1 effects increase cardiac output. Beta-2 effects cause bronchodilation, relieving respiratory distress. This multi-system effect makes it the first-line treatment. Clinical Pearl: Administer epinephrine in the mid-outer thigh; absorption is faster and more reliable than subcutaneous administration. Repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed.",
    "incorrect": "Diphenhydramine, albuterol, and methylprednisolone are adjunctive therapies but do not address the immediate life-threatening issues of hypotension and upper airway obstruction as rapidly as epinephrine. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that targets histamine-mediated symptoms like urticaria but does not reverse hypotension or stridor. Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist that treats bronchospasm (lower airway), not the laryngeal edema causing stridor (upper airway). Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid with a delayed onset (hours) and is used to prevent a biphasic reaction, not for acute resuscitation.",

In anaphylaxis, mast cells and basophils release mediators causing vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and inflammation. Epinephrine reverses these effects.
