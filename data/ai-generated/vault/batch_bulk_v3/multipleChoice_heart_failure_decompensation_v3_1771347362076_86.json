            "opt_1"
        ],
        "rationales": {
            "opt_1": "Correct. The client is experiencing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with severe fluid volume overload, evidenced by profound dyspnea, labored breathing (RR 32), hypoxia (SpO2 88%), widespread crackles, JVD, and significant peripheral edema. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that will rapidly promote diuresis, reduce preload and pulmonary congestion, and improve gas exchange. This is the priority action to alleviate the life-threatening respiratory distress.",
            "opt_2": "Incorrect. While a BNP level is a key diagnostic marker for heart failure and helps to quantify the degree of ventricular stretch and heart failure severity, it is a diagnostic test. Obtaining a blood sample does not resolve the client's immediate, life-threatening problem of pulmonary edema and hypoxia. Therapeutic interventions to improve oxygenation and reduce fluid overload take precedence over diagnostic testing.",
            "opt_3": "Incorrect. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for chronic management of heart failure. However, in the setting of acute decompensation with hemodynamic instability and significant fluid overload, initiating or increasing a beta-blocker is contraindicated. Its negative inotropic effects (decreasing contractility) can worsen cardiac output and precipitate cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers are typically held or have their doses reduced during an acute exacerbation.",
            "opt_4": "Incorrect. Sodium and fluid restrictions are crucial components of long-term heart failure management to prevent future exacerbations. While this order should be implemented, it is not the priority action. Dietary restrictions will not provide the rapid relief needed to address the client's acute pulmonary congestion and severe respiratory distress. The immediate need is for pharmacological intervention to remove excess fluid."
