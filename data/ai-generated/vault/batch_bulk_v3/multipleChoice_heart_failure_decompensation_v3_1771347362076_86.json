    ],
    "rationales": {
      "opt_1": "Correct. The client is experiencing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) secondary to non-adherence to furosemide, leading to severe fluid volume overload. The pathophysiology involves increased preload and afterload, causing pulmonary congestion and impaired gas exchange. The elevated blood pressure (162/98 mmHg) reflects increased systemic vascular resistance due to fluid retention and sympathetic nervous system activation. The hypoxia (SpO2 88%) and respiratory distress (RR 32, labored breathing, crackles) indicate pulmonary edema. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, promoting rapid diuresis. This reduces preload, pulmonary congestion, and improves oxygenation, addressing the immediate life-threatening respiratory distress. Clinical Pearl: Monitor potassium levels closely after furosemide administration, as hypokalemia can occur and exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias.",
      "opt_2": "Incorrect. While a BNP level is a key diagnostic marker for heart failure and helps to quantify the degree of ventricular stretch and heart failure severity, it is a diagnostic test. BNP is released from ventricular myocytes in response to increased wall stress. Elevated BNP levels confirm heart failure but do not address the immediate respiratory distress. Obtaining a blood sample does not resolve the client's immediate, life-threatening problem of pulmonary edema and hypoxia. Therapeutic interventions to improve oxygenation and reduce fluid overload take precedence over diagnostic testing. Clinical Pearl: BNP levels can be falsely low in obese patients.",
      "opt_3": "Incorrect. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for chronic management of heart failure to reduce heart rate and blood pressure, thereby decreasing myocardial workload and improving cardiac remodeling. However, in the setting of acute decompensation with hemodynamic instability and significant fluid overload, initiating or increasing a beta-blocker is contraindicated. Its negative inotropic effects (decreasing contractility) can worsen cardiac output and precipitate cardiogenic shock. The client's heart rate is already elevated (118 bpm), and further slowing it down could compromise cardiac output. Beta-blockers are typically held or have their doses reduced during an acute exacerbation. Clinical Pearl: Beta-blockers should be initiated at low doses and titrated slowly in stable heart failure patients.",
      "opt_4": "Incorrect. Sodium and fluid restrictions are crucial components of long-term heart failure management to prevent future exacerbations by reducing fluid retention and preload. While this order should be implemented as part of the overall care plan, it is not the priority action. Dietary restrictions will not provide the rapid relief needed to address the client's acute pulmonary congestion and severe respiratory distress. The immediate need is for pharmacological intervention to remove excess fluid. Clinical Pearl: Educate patients on hidden sources of sodium in processed foods."
