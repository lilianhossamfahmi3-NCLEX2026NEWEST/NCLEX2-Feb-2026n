It does not lower the serum potassium level but is a temporizing measure that prevents cardiac arrest, buying time for other treatments to work."

Insulin temporarily shifts potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space, lowering the serum potassium level. However, this action takes about 20-30 minutes to begin. The immediate priority is protecting the heart from the current level of potassium, which is achieved faster with calcium gluconate."

However, arranging for dialysis (e.g., placing a temporary catheter, preparing the machine, coordinating with the dialysis unit) takes significant time. The nurse must first implement immediate, life-saving measures to stabilize the client's cardiac status before initiating preparations for dialysis."
