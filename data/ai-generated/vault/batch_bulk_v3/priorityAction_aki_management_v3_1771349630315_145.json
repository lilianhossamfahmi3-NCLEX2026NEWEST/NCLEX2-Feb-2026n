        "rationale": "The client is experiencing life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ 6.8 mEq/L) with ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS). These findings indicate significant myocardial irritability and increased risk of fatal arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, asystole). Calcium gluconate directly antagonizes the effects of potassium on the cardiac cell membrane, stabilizing it and reducing the risk of arrhythmia. It does NOT lower the potassium level but provides immediate cardioprotection, buying time for other interventions to reduce serum potassium. The pathophysiology involves hyperkalemia-induced depolarization of cardiac cells, leading to impaired repolarization and increased excitability. Calcium increases the threshold potential, making the cells less excitable and preventing arrhythmias. Clinical Pearl: Always prioritize interventions that address immediate threats to life. ECG changes in the context of hyperkalemia are a critical finding requiring immediate action."

        "rationale": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is a cation exchange resin that binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract and promotes its excretion in the feces. While appropriate for hyperkalemia, its onset of action is slow (1-2 hours or more). It is not suitable for treating acute, life-threatening hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The pathophysiology involves the exchange of sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, reducing potassium absorption. Clinical Pearl: Kayexalate is not a first-line treatment for severe hyperkalemia due to its slow onset and potential for sodium overload and constipation."

        "rationale": "Insulin and dextrose are used to temporarily shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space, thereby lowering the serum potassium level. Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, increasing potassium uptake by cells. Dextrose is given to prevent hypoglycemia from the insulin. While this is a correct intervention for hyperkalemia, it takes approximately 20-30 minutes to begin working. The immediate priority is to protect the heart from the current level of potassium, which is achieved faster with calcium gluconate. Clinical Pearl: Monitor blood glucose closely when administering insulin and dextrose for hyperkalemia, as hypoglycemia can occur.",
        "pathophysiology": "Insulin increases cellular uptake of potassium by stimulating the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which moves potassium into cells. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin can lower blood glucose levels."

        "rationale": "Hemodialysis is the most effective method for removing potassium from the body in a client with AKI. However, arranging for dialysis (e.g., placing a temporary catheter, preparing the machine, coordinating with the dialysis unit) takes significant time. The nurse must first implement immediate, life-saving measures to stabilize the client's cardiac status before initiating preparations for dialysis. Clinical Pearl: Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for hyperkalemia in AKI but requires preparation and is not an immediate intervention.",
        "pathophysiology": "Hemodialysis removes potassium from the blood by diffusion across a semipermeable membrane. The dialysate fluid has a lower potassium concentration than the blood, creating a concentration gradient that drives potassium removal."
