    "textToHighlight": "A 16-year-old male with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy presents for a scheduled clinic visit. He is confined to a powered wheelchair for all mobility. Bilateral calf pseudohypertrophy noted. He is receiving daily corticosteroid therapy as prescribed. The client's mother states he reports increased difficulty clearing secretions with his cough-assist machine over the past week. Vital signs: T 37.1 C, HR 98, RR 24, BP 102/68, SpO2 93% on room air. Lungs have decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally. The client also reports food 'sticking' in his throat during meals recently. A moderate thoracolumbar scoliosis is present. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm. Chart review shows an ejection fraction of 45% on recent echocardiogram.",

Increased difficulty clearing secretions, a borderline low SpO2 (93%), reports of dysphagia ('food sticking'), and a reduced ejection fraction (45%) all signal significant disease progression and increased risk for respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and heart failure. These findings require immediate follow-up, further assessment, and potential intervention.",

Being wheelchair-dependent, having calf pseudohypertrophy, receiving standard corticosteroid therapy, and the presence of scoliosis are all common and anticipated manifestations of the disease.
