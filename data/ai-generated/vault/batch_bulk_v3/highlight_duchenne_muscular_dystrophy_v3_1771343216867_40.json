Bilateral calf pseudohypertrophy noted. He is receiving daily corticosteroid therapy as prescribed. The client's mother states he reports increased difficulty clearing secretions with his cough-assist machine over the past week. Vital signs: T 37.1 C, HR 98, RR 24, BP 102/68, SpO2 93% on room air. Lungs have decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally. The client also reports food 'sticking' in his throat during meals recently. A moderate thoracolumbar scoliosis is present. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm. Chart review shows an ejection fraction of 45% on recent echocardiogram.",

    "correct": "The nurse should recognize cues indicating worsening cardiorespiratory function and dysphagia, which are life-threatening complications of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in adolescence. Increased difficulty clearing secretions, a borderline low SpO2 (93%), reports of dysphagia ('food sticking'), and a reduced ejection fraction (45%) all signal significant disease progression and increased risk for respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and heart failure. These findings require immediate follow-up, further assessment, and potential intervention. In DMD, progressive muscle weakness affects respiratory muscles, leading to ineffective cough and secretion clearance. Reduced oxygen saturation indicates impaired gas exchange due to weakened respiratory muscles and potential atelectasis. Dysphagia results from bulbar muscle weakness, increasing aspiration risk. Cardiomyopathy, a common complication, reduces the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to decreased ejection fraction and potential heart failure.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings, while relevant to the client's overall condition, represent expected or baseline characteristics of advanced DMD. Being wheelchair-dependent, having calf pseudohypertrophy, receiving standard corticosteroid therapy, and the presence of scoliosis are all common and anticipated manifestations of the disease. They do not indicate an acute change or an immediate, life-threatening problem that requires urgent intervention during this specific visit. Wheelchair dependence is a result of progressive muscle weakness. Calf pseudohypertrophy is a characteristic sign of muscle replacement with fat and connective tissue. Corticosteroids are used to slow disease progression. Scoliosis develops due to weakened paraspinal muscles.",

This borderline oxygen saturation, combined with an elevated respiratory rate of 24, suggests worsening restrictive lung disease and impending respiratory insufficiency.

The weakened respiratory muscles in DMD lead to decreased lung compliance and vital capacity, resulting in hypoventilation and reduced oxygen saturation.
