        "correct": "The comprehensive plan for a client in an acute manic episode prioritizes safety first, as their poor judgment, impulsivity, and potential for agitation pose a risk to themselves and others. Physiological needs are addressed next, focusing on nutrition and hydration with high-energy, portable foods because the client cannot sit still. Communication must be structured, calm, and direct to avoid overstimulation and set clear boundaries. Finally, managing psychomotor agitation involves providing safe, non-competitive outlets for physical energy to prevent escalation.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that are inappropriate for a client in acute mania include those that can increase stimulation (group therapy, caffeine), require concentration (reading, complex rules), or challenge the client's impaired reality testing (confronting delusions). While medication and therapeutic relationships are important, they are not the absolute first priority over immediate physical safety of the client and the environment. Using restrictive measures like seclusion is a last resort, not a primary strategy for energy management.",
