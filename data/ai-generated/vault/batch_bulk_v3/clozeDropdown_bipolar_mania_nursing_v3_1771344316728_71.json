    "correct": "The priority for a client in an acute manic episode is ensuring safety due to impaired judgment, impulsivity, and potential for agitation, which can pose a risk to themselves and others. This aligns with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where safety is paramount. Following safety, addressing physiological needs, such as nutrition and hydration, is crucial. High-calorie, high-protein finger foods are ideal because the client is unlikely to sit for a structured meal. Clear, calm, and direct communication is essential to minimize overstimulation and set boundaries. Finally, managing psychomotor agitation involves providing safe, non-competitive outlets for physical energy to prevent escalation. This approach helps to de-escalate the client and promote a safe environment.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that increase stimulation (group therapy, caffeine) or require concentration (reading, complex rules) are inappropriate for a client in acute mania. Confronting delusions can escalate agitation. While medication and therapeutic relationships are important, they are secondary to immediate safety. Seclusion is a last resort, not a primary strategy for energy management. Open-ended questions can overwhelm the client, and therapeutic silence may be ineffective due to the client's hyperactivity. A well-balanced meal requires the client to sit still, which is unlikely during a manic episode. A low-fat, low-sodium diet is not indicated based on the information provided.",
