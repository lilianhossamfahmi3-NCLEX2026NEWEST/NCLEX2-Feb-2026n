        "correct": "A sudden, severe headache is a primary symptom of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the most life-threatening complication of alteplase therapy. This finding suggests a potential bleed in the brain, which can rapidly increase intracranial pressure and lead to herniation. This constitutes a neurological emergency requiring immediate cessation of tPA infusion (if still running), notification of the healthcare provider, and preparation for an emergent head CT scan.",
        "incorrect": "The other findings, while requiring attention, do not represent the same level of immediate life threat. Permissive hypertension (A) is often maintained to ensure cerebral perfusion post-stroke. Right-sided hemiparesis (B) is an expected finding for a left-sided stroke. Mild hyperglycemia (D) is common due to the stress response and is managed with insulin as per protocol, but it is not an acute emergency.",
