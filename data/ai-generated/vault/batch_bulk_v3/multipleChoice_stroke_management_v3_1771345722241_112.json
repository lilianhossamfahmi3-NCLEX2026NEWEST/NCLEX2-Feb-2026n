  "rationale": {
    "correct": "A sudden, severe headache (8/10) post-alteplase is a critical indicator of potential intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a life-threatening complication. Alteplase, a thrombolytic, increases the risk of bleeding. ICH can rapidly elevate intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to brain herniation and death. Immediate intervention is crucial: stop alteplase (if infusing), notify the provider STAT, prepare for emergent head CT, and anticipate orders for reversal agents (e.g., cryoprecipitate). ClinicalPearl: Time is brain; rapid response is paramount.",
    "incorrect": "Right-sided hemiparesis (B) is expected with a left-sided stroke and doesn't indicate acute deterioration. Permissive hypertension (A) (SBP <180 mmHg, DBP <105 mmHg) is often allowed post-alteplase to maintain cerebral perfusion. Hyperglycemia (D) is common post-stroke due to stress hormones; manage per protocol, but it's not as urgent as ICH.",
