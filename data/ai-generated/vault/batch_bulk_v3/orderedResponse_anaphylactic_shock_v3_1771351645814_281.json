    "stem": "A 52-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department after being stung by a bee. The client reports a 'lump in their throat,' appears anxious, and has widespread urticaria. Vital signs are: BP 82/46 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO2 90% on room air. The nurse hears audible stridor. The healthcare provider has prescribed several interventions. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order of priority? \n\nDrag and drop the nursing actions from the left to the right, arranging them in the correct order of priority from top (first action) to bottom (last action).",

    "correct": "The client is experiencing anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening emergency characterized by severe airway compromise (stridor, dyspnea) and cardiovascular collapse (hypotension, tachycardia). The priority of interventions follows a sequence of addressing the most immediate threats to life. The correct order is: \n1. Administer epinephrine IM: This is the first-line, life-saving intervention. It rapidly reverses bronchoconstriction, counteracts vasodilation to increase blood pressure, and reduces further mediator release. \n2. Apply high-flow oxygen: Stridor and low SpO2 indicate severe respiratory distress and hypoxia. Immediate oxygenation is critical to prevent respiratory arrest. \n3. Initiate rapid IV fluid resuscitation: Profound vasodilation and capillary leakage lead to severe hypotension. Rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids (0.9% NaCl) is essential to restore intravascular volume and blood pressure. \n4. Administer IV diphenhydramine: This H1-antihistamine is a second-line treatment that helps manage cutaneous symptoms like urticaria and pruritus but does not reverse life-threatening respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. It is administered after stabilizing the airway and circulation. \n5. Administer IV methylprednisolone: This corticosteroid is a second-line agent used to prevent a delayed or biphasic anaphylactic reaction. Its onset of action is 4-6 hours, making it the lowest priority in the acute management phase.",

        "content": "**Correct (+)** Epinephrine is the *FIRST* priority. Anaphylaxis causes mast cell and basophil degranulation, releasing histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. This leads to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and laryngeal edema. Epinephrine, a non-selective adrenergic agonist, reverses these effects. Alpha-1 agonism causes vasoconstriction, increasing BP and decreasing edema. Beta-1 agonism increases heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output. Beta-2 agonism causes bronchodilation, relieving airway obstruction.  *Clinical Pearl:* Always administer epinephrine first in anaphylaxis, even if the patient is hypotensive. Delaying epinephrine increases the risk of mortality.",

        "content": "**Correct (+)** The *SECOND* priority is oxygenation. Stridor indicates upper airway obstruction, and SpO2 of 90% signifies hypoxemia.  Anaphylaxis-induced bronchospasm and laryngeal edema impair gas exchange. High-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask delivers the highest possible FiO2, maximizing oxygen delivery to tissues. *Clinical Pearl:* Monitor SpO2 continuously and be prepared to assist with intubation if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates despite oxygen administration.",

        "content": "**Correct (+)** The *THIRD* priority is fluid resuscitation. Anaphylaxis causes massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to intravascular fluid loss and hypotension. Rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline), an isotonic crystalloid, expands the intravascular volume, increasing preload and improving cardiac output. This helps to restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion. *Clinical Pearl:* Monitor the patient closely for signs of fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema, during rapid fluid resuscitation.",

        "content": "**Correct (+)** The *FOURTH* priority is diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that blocks H1 receptors. Histamine, released during anaphylaxis, binds to H1 receptors, causing vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and bronchoconstriction. By blocking H1 receptors, diphenhydramine helps to reduce these effects, alleviating symptoms such as urticaria, pruritus, and angioedema. However, it does not directly reverse bronchospasm or hypotension. *Clinical Pearl:* Diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness. Educate the patient about this side effect and advise them to avoid activities that require alertness.",

        "content": "**Correct (+)** The *FIFTH* priority is methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune system. In anaphylaxis, it helps to prevent a delayed or biphasic reaction by reducing the late-phase inflammatory response. However, corticosteroids have a slow onset of action (4-6 hours) and do not provide immediate relief of acute symptoms. Therefore, it is administered after epinephrine, oxygen, and fluid resuscitation. *Clinical Pearl:* Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose levels. Monitor the patient's blood glucose and administer insulin as needed.",
