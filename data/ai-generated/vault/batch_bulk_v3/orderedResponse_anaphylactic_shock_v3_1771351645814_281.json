        "stem": "A 52-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department after being stung by a bee. The client reports a 'lump in their throat,' appears anxious, and has widespread urticaria. Vital signs are: BP 82/46 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO2 90% on room air. The nurse hears audible stridor. The healthcare provider has prescribed several interventions. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order of priority? \n\nDrag and drop the nursing actions from the left to the right, arranging them in the correct order of priority from top (first action) to bottom (last action).",

        "correct": "The client is experiencing anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening emergency characterized by severe airway compromise (stridor, dyspnea) and cardiovascular collapse (hypotension, tachycardia). The priority of interventions follows a sequence of addressing the most immediate threats to life. The correct order is: \n1. Administer epinephrine IM: This is the first-line, life-saving intervention. It rapidly reverses bronchoconstriction, counteracts vasodilation to increase blood pressure, and reduces further mediator release. \n2. Apply high-flow oxygen: Stridor and low SpO2 indicate severe respiratory distress and hypoxia. Immediate oxygenation is critical to prevent respiratory arrest. \n3. Initiate rapid IV fluid resuscitation: Profound vasodilation and capillary leakage lead to severe hypotension. Rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids (0.9% NaCl) is essential to restore intravascular volume and blood pressure. \n4. Administer IV diphenhydramine: This H1-antihistamine is a second-line treatment that helps manage cutaneous symptoms like urticaria and pruritus but does not reverse life-threatening respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. It is administered after stabilizing the airway and circulation. \n5. Administer IV methylprednisolone: This corticosteroid is a second-line agent used to prevent a delayed or biphasic anaphylactic reaction. Its onset of action is 4-6 hours, making it the lowest priority in the acute management phase.",

Its alpha-adrenergic effects reverse vasodilation and decrease edema, while its beta-adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation and increase myocardial contractility.
