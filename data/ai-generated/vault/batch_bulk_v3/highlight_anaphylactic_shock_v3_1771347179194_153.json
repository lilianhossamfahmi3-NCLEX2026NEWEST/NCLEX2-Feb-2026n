  "transcript": "A 45-year-old male presents to the ED after he was stung by a bee on his right forearm approximately 20 minutes ago while gardening. He states he removed the stinger immediately. He has a known allergy to bee stings but does not have his prescribed epinephrine auto-injector with him. He complains of a 'lump' in his throat and feeling very dizzy and lightheaded. Upon assessment, there is audible inspiratory stridor. His blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg. There is diffuse urticaria and flushing across his chest and back. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pain at the sting site is a 3/10. Temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F).",

    "correct": "The selected findings are the cardinal signs of anaphylactic shock, a severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Bee stings can trigger this in sensitized individuals. The combination of airway compromise (lump in throat, stridor), circulatory collapse (hypotension, dizziness), and cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, flushing) confirms the diagnosis. The underlying pathophysiology involves IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators. These mediators cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus production. Immediate interventions, such as epinephrine administration, are crucial to reverse these effects and prevent respiratory and cardiovascular arrest. Epinephrine acts as a vasopressor, bronchodilator, and mast cell stabilizer.",
    "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either part of the patient's history, an expected local reaction, or a normal finding. While the bee sting is the trigger, it is not a current clinical sign of shock. Localized pain is expected from the sting but does not indicate a systemic reaction. A normal temperature is not indicative of the severity of the allergic reaction.",

  "clinicalPearl": "Anaphylactic shock is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Remember the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and administer epinephrine promptly (typically 0.3-0.5 mg IM in adults).  Repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed. Always assess for a history of allergies and ensure patients with known allergies have access to and understand how to use their epinephrine auto-injector. Educate patients on avoidance strategies and the importance of carrying emergency medication. Consider a biphasic reaction, where symptoms recur hours later, requiring observation.",
