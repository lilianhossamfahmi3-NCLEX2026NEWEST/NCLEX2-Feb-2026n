    "transcript": "A 45-year-old male presents to the ED after he was stung by a bee on his right forearm approximately 20 minutes ago while gardening. He states he removed the stinger immediately. He has a known allergy to bee stings but does not have his prescribed epinephrine auto-injector with him. He complains of a 'lump' in his throat and feeling very dizzy and lightheaded. Upon assessment, there is audible inspiratory stridor. His blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg. There is diffuse urticaria and flushing across his chest and back. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pain at the sting site is a 3/10. Temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F).",

        "correct": "The selected findings are the cardinal signs of anaphylactic shock, a systemic, life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. The combination of airway compromise (lump in throat, stridor), circulatory collapse (hypotension, dizziness), and cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, flushing) confirms the diagnosis and necessitates immediate administration of epinephrine and other emergency interventions to prevent respiratory and cardiovascular arrest.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either part of the patient's history, an expected local reaction, or a normal finding. While the bee sting is the trigger, it is not a current clinical sign of shock. Localized pain is expected from the sting but does not indicate a systemic reaction. A normal temperature is not indicative of the severity of the allergic reaction.",
