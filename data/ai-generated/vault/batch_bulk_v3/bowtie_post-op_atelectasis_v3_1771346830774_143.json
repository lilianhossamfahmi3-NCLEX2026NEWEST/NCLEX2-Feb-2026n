        "correct": "The client's presentation of shallow breathing due to pain, diminished breath sounds at the bases, fine crackles, low-grade fever, tachypnea, and mild hypoxemia following abdominal surgery strongly indicates post-operative atelectasis. This condition is caused by the collapse of alveoli, often due to inadequate lung expansion. The priority nursing actions are to manage the underlying cause (pain) and promote lung re-expansion. Administering the prescribed morphine will alleviate the pain, allowing the client to breathe more deeply. Using the incentive spirometer and ambulating are direct interventions to open collapsed alveoli and mobilize secretions. To evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions, the nurse must monitor parameters directly related to respiratory function (oxygen saturation, breath sounds) and the precipitating factor (pain rating).",
        "incorrect": "Conditions like pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or heart failure are less likely. A PE typically presents more acutely with pleuritic chest pain and may not have localized diminished breath sounds. Pneumonia is a possibility but atelectasis is the more common and immediate precursor. There are no signs of heart failure (e.g., JVD, peripheral edema). Placing the client supine would worsen atelectasis. A CT scan is not an initial nursing action; basic nursing interventions should be performed first. Monitoring urine output and incisional drainage are important for general post-operative care but are not specific to assessing the resolution of atelectasis.",
