  "prompt": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old male client who is 2 days post-operative from an open cholecystectomy. The nurse performs an assessment and documents the findings in the electronic health record. Based on the client's assessment findings, what condition is the client most likely experiencing? What actions should the nurse take? What parameters should the nurse monitor to assess for improvement?",

    "correct": "The client's presentation (shallow breathing due to pain, diminished breath sounds at the bases, fine crackles, low-grade fever (38.1°C), tachypnea (24/min), and mild hypoxemia (SpO2 92%)) following abdominal surgery strongly indicates post-operative atelectasis. Atelectasis is the collapse of alveoli, often due to hypoventilation, pain, and immobility post-surgery. The inflammatory process and reduced surfactant production contribute to alveolar collapse. The priority nursing actions are to manage pain and promote lung re-expansion. Morphine (prescribed analgesic) will alleviate pain, enabling deeper breaths. Incentive spirometry and ambulation promote alveolar expansion and secretion mobilization. Monitoring oxygen saturation, breath sounds, and pain rating assesses intervention effectiveness.",
    "incorrect": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) typically presents with acute pleuritic chest pain and may not have localized diminished breath sounds. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is possible, but atelectasis is a more common immediate precursor. HAP usually presents with productive cough and higher fever. Heart failure exacerbation signs (JVD, edema) are absent. Placing the client supine worsens atelectasis. A CT scan is not the initial nursing action; basic interventions should be tried first. Monitoring urine output and incisional drainage are important for post-operative care but not specific to atelectasis resolution.",
