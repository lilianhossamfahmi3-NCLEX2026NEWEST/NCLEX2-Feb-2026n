The ventilator is set to assist-control/volume control (AC/VC) mode. The nurse hears the high-pressure alarm sound continuously. The client appears agitated, is tachycardic at 130/min, and the SpO2 has dropped from 94% to 88%. The nurse must intervene immediately. Drag and drop the following actions into the correct order the nurse should perform them. All steps are required.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate patient assessment and intervention for life-threatening conditions before involving other team members or performing diagnostic tests. The first step is to rapidly assess the patient (auscultate lungs, check chest rise) to identify potential causes like pneumothorax or mainstem intubation. The second step is to attempt to clear the most common reversible cause of a high-pressure alarm: a mucous plug. If these actions fail and the client remains unstable, the third step is to disconnect the client from the ventilator and provide manual ventilation to ensure oxygenation and determine if the problem is with the client or the machine. Only after initiating these critical life-saving measures should the nurse proceed to the fourth step of notifying the interprofessional team (RT, provider). Subsequently, after managing airway and breathing, the fifth step is to address potential patient-ventilator asynchrony with PRN sedation. Finally, the last step is to obtain a definitive diagnostic image to rule out underlying pathology.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order of actions fails to prioritize immediate life threats and proper troubleshooting. For example, sedating the client first could mask a serious underlying issue like a tension pneumothorax or completely obstruct the airway if a mucous plug is the cause. Calling the provider before performing a basic assessment wastes critical time. Obtaining a chest x-ray is important, but it is not a direct intervention and should not precede stabilizing the client's oxygenation and ventilation. Troubleshooting must follow a logical, prioritized sequence from patient assessment to direct intervention to escalation and diagnostics.",
