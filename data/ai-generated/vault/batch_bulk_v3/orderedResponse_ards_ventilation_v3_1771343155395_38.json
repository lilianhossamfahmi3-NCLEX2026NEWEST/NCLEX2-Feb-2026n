  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) who was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation 4 hours ago. The ventilator is set to assist-control/volume control (AC/VC) mode. The nurse hears the high-pressure alarm sound continuously. The client appears agitated, is tachycardic at 130/min, and the SpO2 has dropped from 94% to 88%. The nurse must intervene immediately. Drag and drop the following actions into the correct order the nurse should perform them. All steps are required.",

    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate assessment and intervention for life-threatening conditions before involving other team members or performing diagnostic tests. Rapid assessment (auscultating lungs, checking chest rise) identifies potential causes like pneumothorax or mainstem intubation. Attempting to clear a mucous plug addresses a common reversible cause of a high-pressure alarm. If these actions fail and the client remains unstable, manual ventilation ensures oxygenation and helps determine if the problem is with the client or the machine. Only after these critical measures should the nurse notify the interprofessional team (RT, provider). Subsequently, after managing airway and breathing, PRN sedation can address potential patient-ventilator asynchrony. Finally, a diagnostic image rules out underlying pathology.",
    "incorrect": "Any other order fails to prioritize immediate life threats and proper troubleshooting. Sedating the client first could mask a serious underlying issue or obstruct the airway if a mucous plug is the cause. Calling the provider before a basic assessment wastes critical time. A chest x-ray is important but shouldn't precede stabilizing oxygenation and ventilation. Troubleshooting follows a logical, prioritized sequence.",
