        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions follows the 'Airway, Breathing, Circulation' (ABC) framework for managing a client with a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who is in respiratory distress. The first priority is to maximize ventilation and oxygenation. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position immediately facilitates lung expansion. Applying high-flow oxygen directly addresses the hypoxemia caused by the V/Q mismatch. Once these immediate life-sustaining actions are initiated, the nurse must activate the Rapid Response Team to bring advanced care to the bedside. While awaiting the RRT, gathering baseline vital signs is crucial for trending the client's condition. Finally, establishing IV access prepares the client for the definitive treatment of anticoagulation, which is a critical but subsequent step after immediate stabilization.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence would delay critical life-saving interventions. For example, notifying the RRT before positioning the client and applying oxygen delays direct treatment for hypoxemia. Establishing IV access or obtaining vital signs before addressing the compromised breathing pattern is incorrect prioritization, as the most immediate threat to life is respiratory failure.",
