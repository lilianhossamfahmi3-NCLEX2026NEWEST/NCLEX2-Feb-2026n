    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate respiratory support and rapid escalation of care. Placing the client in high-Fowler's (04) maximizes lung expansion, addressing dyspnea. Administering oxygen via non-rebreather (02) directly combats hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) caused by ventilation-perfusion mismatch in PE. Notifying the RRT (01) brings critical care expertise for advanced interventions. Obtaining vital signs (03) establishes a baseline for monitoring. Establishing IV access (05) prepares for anticoagulation, a crucial but later step.",

    "pathophysiology": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a thrombus (blood clot) lodges in a pulmonary artery, obstructing blood flow to the lungs. This obstruction causes a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, where alveoli are ventilated but not perfused, leading to hypoxemia. The sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain. Severe PE can cause hemodynamic instability, shock, and death. The pleuritic chest pain arises from inflammation of the pleura due to pulmonary infarction. Tachypnea is a compensatory mechanism to increase oxygen uptake. Anxiety is a common response to dyspnea and the feeling of impending doom.",
