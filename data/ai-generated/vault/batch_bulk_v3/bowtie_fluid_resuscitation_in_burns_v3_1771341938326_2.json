        "correct": "The client has sustained full-thickness burns to approximately 27% of their total body surface area (TBSA) (entire left arm = 9%, anterior trunk = 18%). This major burn injury causes a massive fluid shift from the intravascular to the interstitial space, leading to burn shock. The priority action is to restore circulating volume by establishing large-bore IV access and initiating aggressive fluid resuscitation, typically with lactated Ringer's solution, using a formula like the Parkland formula. The most reliable indicator of adequate end-organ perfusion and successful resuscitation during the emergent phase is hourly urine output, with a target of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr (35-70 mL/hr for this client). Due to the circumferential full-thickness burn on the arm, the eschar can become restrictive as edema develops from the injury and fluid resuscitation. This can constrict blood flow and lead to compartment syndrome, a limb-threatening emergency.",
        "incorrect": "Initial actions should prioritize circulation and perfusion (preventing burn shock) over wound care or pain management, although those are important secondary interventions. Monitoring parameters must be sensitive to volume status; while vital signs are monitored, urine output is the gold standard for assessing resuscitation adequacy. Potential conditions must be considered based on the specific injury pattern; while hypovolemic shock is the underlying problem being treated, compartment syndrome is a direct and immediate potential complication of the circumferential burn and the subsequent edema from fluid resuscitation.",
