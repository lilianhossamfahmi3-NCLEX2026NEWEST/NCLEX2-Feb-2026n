Splinting reduces tidal volume and impairs the cough mechanism, leading to retained secretions and alveolar collapse. This is a primary cause of post-operative atelectasis. **Clinical Pearl:** Proactive pain management is crucial to prevent respiratory complications.",
        "rationale": "Postoperative pain, especially after abdominal surgery, can lead to splinting, where the client consciously or unconsciously limits chest wall expansion to minimize pain. This reduces tidal volume and impairs the cough mechanism, leading to retained secretions and alveolar collapse.",

Administer pain medication as prescribed, and assess its effectiveness regularly. Consider non-pharmacological pain management techniques, such as relaxation and guided imagery."

        "feedback": "**Correct (+):** Shallow respirations and mild tachypnea (normal rate is 12-20/min) are classic signs of atelectasis. The body attempts to compensate for poor gas exchange in collapsed alveoli by increasing the breathing rate. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor respiratory rate and depth closely in post-operative clients.",
        "rationale": "Shallow respirations indicate reduced tidal volume, meaning less air is moving in and out of the lungs. Tachypnea is a compensatory mechanism to maintain adequate oxygenation when tidal volume is reduced. This combination suggests impaired gas exchange.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "feedback": "**Correct (+):** This is a hallmark physical assessment finding for atelectasis. The collapse of alveoli, most commonly in the dependent lung bases, prevents normal air movement, resulting in decreased or absent breath sounds. **Clinical Pearl:** Auscultate breath sounds in all lung fields, comparing side to side, to detect areas of decreased air entry.",
        "rationale": "Diminished breath sounds indicate reduced airflow to that area of the lung. In atelectasis, the collapsed alveoli prevent air from entering, leading to decreased sound transmission during auscultation. The lower lobes are most commonly affected due to gravity and the client's supine position.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Reposition the client frequently to promote lung expansion in different areas. Encourage the client to cough effectively to clear secretions."

Collapsed alveoli are still perfused with blood but are not ventilated with air, leading to a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and a decrease in oxygen saturation. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor oxygen saturation continuously or intermittently, and titrate supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain target SpO2.",
        "rationale": "In atelectasis, blood passes through the collapsed alveoli without picking up oxygen, resulting in a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. This means that some areas of the lung are perfused but not ventilated, leading to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation.",
