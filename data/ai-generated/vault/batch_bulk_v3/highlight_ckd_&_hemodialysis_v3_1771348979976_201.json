    "correct": "The nurse must immediately follow up on the client's disorientation, dizziness upon sitting, and bleeding from the access sites. Disorientation can signal dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by rapid shifts in cerebral fluid and urea. Dizziness upon sitting is a key symptom of orthostatic hypotension, which is a significant risk after large-volume fluid removal during dialysis and can lead to falls. Any bleeding from the access sites, especially bright red blood, is a major concern for hemorrhage, as the client received heparin during dialysis and the high-pressure fistula can bleed profusely.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings are expected after a hemodialysis session. Feeling tired is a very common side effect. A weight decrease of 2.8 kg reflects the successful and intended removal of excess fluid. The vital signs are within normal limits and stable. A continuous bruit over the AV fistula is a positive finding, indicating that the fistula is patent and has adequate blood flow.",

        "label": "is disoriented to time and place",
        "content": "**Rationale:** Disorientation post-dialysis can indicate Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS). Rapid urea removal during dialysis creates an osmotic gradient, drawing fluid into the brain, causing cerebral edema and neurological symptoms. This is more common in patients new to dialysis or with pre-existing neurological conditions. **Clinical Pearl:** DDS can progress rapidly. Immediate intervention includes slowing or stopping dialysis, administering hypertonic saline or mannitol to reduce cerebral edema, and notifying the nephrologist.",

        "label": "Complains of dizziness when sitting up",
        "content": "**Rationale:** Dizziness upon sitting indicates orthostatic hypotension, a common complication after hemodialysis due to rapid fluid removal (2.8L in this case). This reduces circulating blood volume, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion upon positional changes. The body's compensatory mechanisms (e.g., vasoconstriction) may be insufficient to maintain blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Implement safety measures immediately (e.g., assist with position changes, have client sit on the edge of the bed before standing). Assess orthostatic vital signs (BP and HR supine, sitting, and standing). Consider administering IV fluids as prescribed.",

        "label": "are covered with a dressing that has two quarter-sized spots of bright red blood",
        "content": "**Rationale:** Bright red blood indicates active bleeding from the AV fistula access sites. Hemodialysis requires systemic heparinization to prevent clotting within the dialysis circuit. The AV fistula is a high-pressure system, so even small disruptions can lead to significant blood loss, especially with impaired coagulation. **Clinical Pearl:** Apply direct pressure to the bleeding sites immediately for at least 10-15 minutes. Monitor vital signs for signs of hypovolemia (tachycardia, hypotension). Notify the healthcare provider if bleeding persists despite direct pressure. Assess the client's coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT).",

        "label": "Reports feeling tired",
        "content": "**Rationale:** Fatigue is a common post-dialysis symptom due to the physiological stress of the procedure, electrolyte shifts, and removal of uremic toxins. While it requires monitoring, it's not an immediate threat. **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage rest and monitor for worsening symptoms. Assess hemoglobin levels as anemia is common in ESKD and contributes to fatigue.",

        "label": "a decrease of 2.8 kg",
        "content": "**Rationale:** This weight decrease reflects the intended fluid removal during dialysis, indicating effective ultrafiltration. The goal is to remove excess fluid accumulated between dialysis sessions to prevent fluid overload complications. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor) if excessive fluid is removed.",

        "label": "BP 130/78 mmHg",
        "content": "**Rationale:** This blood pressure is within an acceptable range post-dialysis, especially considering the client's history of ESKD, where hypertension is common. It suggests adequate fluid removal without causing significant hypotension (unless the pre-dialysis BP was significantly higher). **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor trends in blood pressure. A sudden drop could indicate hypovolemia, while a sustained elevation could indicate fluid overload or uncontrolled hypertension.",

        "content": "**Rationale:** A continuous bruit over the AV fistula is a normal and expected finding. It indicates patency and adequate blood flow through the fistula, which is essential for effective dialysis. The bruit is caused by the turbulent blood flow through the surgically created connection between an artery and a vein. **Clinical Pearl:** Palpate for a thrill (vibration) over the fistula as well. Absence of a bruit or thrill may indicate thrombosis or stenosis of the fistula, requiring immediate evaluation.",
