The client <mark>is disoriented to time and place</mark>, stating it is 'morning in 1999'. Auscultation of the left arm AV fistula reveals a continuous bruit. <mark>Complains of dizziness when sitting up</mark>. The two needle access sites on the AV fistula <mark>are covered with a dressing that has two quarter-sized spots of bright red blood</mark>. Reports mild fatigue but denies headache or nausea."

        "correct": "The nurse must immediately follow up on the client's disorientation, dizziness upon sitting, and bleeding from the access sites. Disorientation can signal dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by rapid shifts in cerebral fluid and urea. Dizziness upon sitting is a key symptom of orthostatic hypotension, which is a significant risk after large-volume fluid removal during dialysis and can lead to falls. Any bleeding from the access sites, especially bright red blood, is a major concern for hemorrhage, as the client received heparin during dialysis and the high-pressure fistula can bleed profusely.",
        "incorrect": "The other findings are expected after a hemodialysis session. Feeling tired is a very common side effect. A weight decrease of 2.8 kg reflects the successful and intended removal of excess fluid. The vital signs are within normal limits and stable. A continuous bruit over the AV fistula is a positive finding, indicating that the fistula is patent and has adequate blood flow.",
