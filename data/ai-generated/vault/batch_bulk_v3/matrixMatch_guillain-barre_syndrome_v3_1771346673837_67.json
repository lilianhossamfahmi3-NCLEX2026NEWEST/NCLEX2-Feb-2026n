        "rationale": "Correct. Ascending, symmetrical paresthesia and weakness are hallmark neurological manifestations of GBS. The pathophysiology involves an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. This demyelination disrupts nerve signal transmission, leading to sensory disturbances (paresthesia) and motor weakness. The ascending pattern reflects the typical progression of the disease, starting distally and moving proximally.",

        "columnId": "col2",
        "rationale": "Correct. A forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 15-20 mL/kg is a critical respiratory finding, indicating severe weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. GBS-induced paralysis affects the respiratory muscles, reducing the client's ability to generate adequate inspiratory and expiratory pressures. This leads to decreased FVC, impaired gas exchange, and ultimately, respiratory failure. The reduced FVC signifies a significant compromise in the client's ventilatory capacity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Monitor FVC closely in GBS clients. A declining FVC indicates impending respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation."

        "rowId": "row3",
        "columnId": "col3",
        "rationale": "Correct. Labile blood pressure (wide fluctuations between hypertension and hypotension) is a classic cardiovascular sign of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in GBS. The demyelination process in GBS can affect autonomic nerve fibers, leading to dysregulation of vascular tone and heart rate. This dysautonomia results in unpredictable swings in blood pressure, increasing the risk of end-organ damage and cardiovascular instability. The fluctuating blood pressure reflects the impaired ability of the ANS to maintain hemodynamic stability.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Be vigilant for signs of autonomic dysfunction, such as labile blood pressure and arrhythmias, as they can be life-threatening in GBS."

        "rationale": "Correct. The inability to lift the head or shoulders is a direct measure of severe, widespread muscle weakness affecting the neck and trunk muscles. This is a significant neurological finding that indicates advanced progression of the paralysis. The pathophysiology involves the progressive demyelination affecting motor nerves, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. The inability to perform basic motor functions like lifting the head signifies significant neurological impairment.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess motor strength regularly, focusing on proximal muscle groups, to track the progression of paralysis in GBS."

        "rationale": "Correct. Unexplained swings between bradycardia and tachycardia are cardiovascular manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in GBS. This dysautonomia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and requires continuous cardiac monitoring. The autonomic nervous system controls heart rate and rhythm. Demyelination of autonomic fibers disrupts this control, leading to unpredictable heart rate fluctuations. Bradycardia can result from vagal nerve involvement, while tachycardia can be caused by sympathetic overactivity.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage potentially life-threatening arrhythmias associated with autonomic dysfunction in GBS."

        "rowId": "row6",
        "columnId": "col1",
        "rationale": "Correct. Facial droop (cranial nerve VII) and dysphagia (cranial nerves IX, X, XII) are serious neurological findings indicating the progression of GBS to involve the cranial nerves. This increases the risk for aspiration and requires airway protection measures. Cranial nerve involvement occurs when the demyelination process extends to the cranial nerves, affecting their function. Facial droop indicates weakness of the facial muscles, while dysphagia indicates difficulty swallowing due to impaired function of the pharyngeal muscles.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess cranial nerve function regularly, especially swallowing ability, to prevent aspiration and ensure airway safety."
