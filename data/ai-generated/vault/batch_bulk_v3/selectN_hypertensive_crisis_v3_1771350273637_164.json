He reports running out of his lisinopril and amlodipine one week ago. The client is agitated and disoriented to time and place.\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n*   Blood Pressure: 224/138 mmHg\n*   Heart Rate: 112 beats/minute\n*   Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute\n*   Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air\n*   Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)",

        {
            "optionId": "opt_1",
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing a hypertensive emergency with evidence of end-organ damage (neurological symptoms). A potent, titratable intravenous vasodilator like nitroprusside is the standard of care to allow for controlled, rapid reduction of blood pressure."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering a large, rapid fluid bolus would increase intravascular volume and preload, which would further elevate the client's already critically high blood pressure and worsen cardiac strain. Fluid management must be cautious in this client, especially with a history of CKD."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's presenting symptoms of severe headache, blurred vision, and confusion are indicative of hypertensive encephalopathy. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., every 15 minutes) are critical to monitor for improvement or deterioration in mental status, which reflects cerebral perfusion and response to treatment."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "rationale": "Correct. A blood pressure of 224/138 mmHg places immense strain on the myocardium, increasing the risk of acute myocardial ischemia, infarction, or life-threatening arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect these complications promptly."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client's medication non-adherence is the likely cause, oral antihypertensives are not appropriate for an emergency. Their onset of action is too slow and unpredictable for the precise blood pressure control needed. IV medications are required."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "rationale": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage from the brain, which can help lower intracranial pressure associated with hypertensive encephalopathy. It also improves chest expansion and reduces the work of breathing."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_7",
            "rationale": "Correct. An indwelling urinary catheter is necessary for strict, accurate monitoring of urine output. This is a crucial indicator of renal perfusion and function, especially important given the client's pre-existing CKD and the risk of acute kidney injury from the hypertensive crisis."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_8",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The client is confused, agitated, and has blurred vision, making them a significant fall risk. Ambulation is unsafe. Furthermore, physical exertion can increase blood pressure. Strict bed rest is indicated to ensure safety and minimize cardiovascular stress."
