      "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, evidenced by a BP of 224/138 mmHg and neurological symptoms (headache, blurred vision, confusion), indicating end-organ damage. Nitroprusside, a potent and rapidly acting vasodilator, is indicated for controlled BP reduction in hypertensive emergencies.  **Pathophysiology:** Nitroprusside reduces preload and afterload by directly relaxing arteriolar and venous smooth muscle, decreasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and blood pressure.  **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for cyanide toxicity (metabolic acidosis, altered mental status) with prolonged nitroprusside use, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Titrate carefully to avoid precipitous drops in BP.",

      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Rapid fluid boluses are contraindicated in hypertensive emergencies, especially in patients with CKD.  Increasing intravascular volume can exacerbate hypertension and lead to pulmonary edema and heart failure. **Pathophysiology:**  Increased fluid volume raises preload, increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. In CKD, the kidneys' ability to excrete excess fluid is impaired, further contributing to volume overload. **Clinical Pearl:**  Carefully assess fluid status and administer fluids cautiously, if at all, in hypertensive emergencies, particularly in patients with renal or cardiac compromise.",

      "rationale": "Correct. The client's neurological symptoms suggest hypertensive encephalopathy, a life-threatening complication. Frequent neurological assessments (LOC, pupillary response, motor function) are crucial to monitor for worsening cerebral edema or ischemia. **Pathophysiology:**  Hypertensive encephalopathy occurs when severely elevated BP overwhelms the brain's autoregulatory mechanisms, leading to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and neurological dysfunction. **Clinical Pearl:**  Document neurological findings meticulously and report any changes immediately.  Rapid intervention is essential to prevent permanent neurological damage.",

      "rationale": "Correct.  Extreme hypertension places significant stress on the heart, increasing the risk of myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and treat these complications promptly. **Pathophysiology:**  Elevated afterload increases myocardial oxygen demand.  If oxygen supply is insufficient, ischemia can occur, leading to arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. **Clinical Pearl:**  Monitor for signs of myocardial ischemia (ST-segment changes, chest pain) and arrhythmias.  Have emergency medications and equipment readily available.",

      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Oral antihypertensives are not appropriate for hypertensive emergencies. Their onset of action is too slow and unpredictable to achieve the rapid and controlled BP reduction required. **Pathophysiology:**  Oral medications require absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which can be delayed or impaired in critically ill patients.  Intravenous medications provide immediate and predictable effects. **Clinical Pearl:**  Intravenous antihypertensives are the preferred route for hypertensive emergencies, allowing for precise titration and rapid response.",

      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed promotes venous drainage from the brain, which can help reduce intracranial pressure associated with hypertensive encephalopathy. It also improves respiratory effort. **Pathophysiology:**  Elevating the head of the bed decreases venous return from the brain, reducing cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure. **Clinical Pearl:**  Maintain a semi-Fowler's position (30 degrees) unless contraindicated. Avoid Trendelenburg position, which increases intracranial pressure.",

      "rationale": "Correct.  An indwelling urinary catheter is necessary for accurate monitoring of urine output, a crucial indicator of renal perfusion and function. This is especially important given the client's pre-existing CKD and the risk of acute kidney injury from the hypertensive crisis. **Pathophysiology:**  Severe hypertension can damage the kidneys, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and reduced urine output.  Monitoring urine output helps assess renal function and guide fluid management. **Clinical Pearl:**  Report any significant decrease in urine output (oliguria) immediately.  This may indicate acute kidney injury requiring further intervention.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's altered mental status and blurred vision increase the risk of falls. Furthermore, physical exertion can elevate blood pressure. Strict bed rest is indicated to ensure safety and minimize cardiovascular stress. **Pathophysiology:**  Physical activity increases sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to vasoconstriction and increased heart rate, both of which elevate blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:**  Implement fall precautions and provide assistance with all activities.  Ensure a safe and quiet environment to minimize agitation.",
