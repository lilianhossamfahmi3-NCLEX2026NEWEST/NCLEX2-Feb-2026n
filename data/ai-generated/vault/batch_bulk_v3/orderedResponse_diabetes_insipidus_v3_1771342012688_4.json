        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia) secondary to massive polyuria from diabetes insipidus. This is compounded by life-threatening hypernatremia. The priority is to first address the hemodynamic instability by restoring circulating volume. The second priority is to administer desmopressin to treat the underlying cause of the fluid loss. Concurrently, the nurse must implement safety and monitoring interventions for the severe electrolyte imbalance (cardiac monitoring, seizure precautions). Finally, establishing precise output measurement is necessary for ongoing management and titration of therapy.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order fails to properly prioritize the immediate life threats. Delaying IV fluids fails to address the client's hypovolemic shock. Delaying desmopressin allows the massive, uncontrolled fluid loss to continue. Neglecting to initiate cardiac monitoring or seizure precautions early puts the client at risk for fatal dysrhythmias or injury from a seizure caused by severe hypernatremia. While urine output monitoring is vital, it does not take precedence over life-saving resuscitation and safety measures.",

                "explanation": "The client's tachycardia (128 bpm) and hypotension (88/52 mmHg) indicate severe hypovolemia and impending circulatory collapse. According to airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles, restoring intravascular volume is the immediate priority. Using a hypotonic solution (0.45% NaCl) begins to correct both the fluid volume deficit and the hypernatremia by providing free water."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Immediately after starting fluid resuscitation, the nurse must administer the medication that treats the underlying cause. Desmopressin is a synthetic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that will act on the renal tubules to increase water reabsorption, thereby decreasing urine output and stopping the massive ongoing fluid loss."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "The client's serum sodium is critically high at 162 mEq/L. Severe hypernatremia alters the electrical potential of cardiac cells, increasing the risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is a crucial safety intervention to detect any EKG changes or arrhythmias promptly."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Severe hypernatremia causes water to move out of brain cells, leading to cellular shrinkage and increased central nervous system irritability. This significantly lowers the seizure threshold. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside) is a critical safety measure to protect the client from injury."

                "explanation": "While this action is essential, it is the last priority among these immediate interventions. Accurate, hourly measurement of urine output and specific gravity is required to effectively titrate IV fluid rates and evaluate the client's response to desmopressin. However, the life-saving interventions of fluid resuscitation, medication administration, and safety precautions must be performed first."
