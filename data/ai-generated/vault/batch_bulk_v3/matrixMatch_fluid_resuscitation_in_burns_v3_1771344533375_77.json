        "correct": "The management of burn injuries requires a dynamic approach to fluid therapy that changes based on the physiological phase of recovery. Initially (first 24-48 hours), massive fluid shifts from the intravascular to the interstitial space necessitate resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid, like Lactated Ringer's, to maintain organ perfusion. After this initial phase, as capillary integrity is restored (around 24-48 hours), colloids like albumin may be used to increase plasma oncotic pressure and pull fluid back into the vascular space, especially if the patient is hypoalbuminemic. Later in recovery (diuretic phase, ~72 hours), electrolyte imbalances like hypernatremia may develop due to insensible water loss, requiring hypotonic solutions to correct the free water deficit. Complications such as rhabdomyolysis also demand aggressive crystalloid resuscitation to prevent acute kidney injury.",
