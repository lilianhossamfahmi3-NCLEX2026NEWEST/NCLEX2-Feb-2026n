    "correct": "The management of burn injuries requires a dynamic approach to fluid therapy that changes based on the physiological phase of recovery. Initially (first 24-48 hours), massive fluid shifts from the intravascular to the interstitial space necessitate resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid, like Lactated Ringer's (LR), to maintain organ perfusion. LR closely resembles the body's extracellular fluid and helps to expand the intravascular volume without causing significant electrolyte imbalances. After this initial phase, as capillary integrity is restored (around 24-48 hours), colloids like albumin may be used to increase plasma oncotic pressure and pull fluid back into the vascular space, especially if the patient is hypoalbuminemic. Albumin, a protein, increases the oncotic pressure in the blood vessels, drawing fluid from the interstitial space back into the circulation, thus reducing edema and improving blood pressure. Later in recovery (diuretic phase, ~72 hours), electrolyte imbalances like hypernatremia may develop due to insensible water loss, requiring hypotonic solutions to correct the free water deficit. Hypernatremia occurs when there is a relative excess of sodium compared to water in the body. Hypotonic solutions like D5 0.45% NaCl provide free water to dilute the sodium concentration. Complications such as rhabdomyolysis also demand aggressive crystalloid resuscitation to prevent acute kidney injury. Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue, releasing myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can damage the kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids helps to flush myoglobin out of the kidneys and prevent damage.",

The client's severe edema and very low albumin (normal range 3.5-5.0 g/dL) indicate a significant loss of oncotic pressure. Administering a colloid solution like Albumin 5% will help pull interstitial fluid back into the intravascular space, increasing blood pressure and reducing edema. Albumin works by increasing the oncotic pressure within the blood vessels, drawing fluid from the interstitial space where edema is present."

While Lactated Ringer's is used for initial resuscitation, administering more crystalloids at this stage without addressing the low oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia would be less effective and could worsen the generalized edema.

Administering colloids like albumin during the first 24 hours is generally avoided because the capillaries are still highly permeable ('leaky') due to the inflammatory response. The albumin would leak into the interstitial space, pulling more fluid with it and worsening edema.
