    "sbar": {
      "situation": "A 48-year-old male client is admitted at 1400 with acute pancreatitis.",
      "background": "The client has a history of cholelithiasis and reports consuming 2-3 beers on weekends. He reports a pain level of 9/10 in the epigastric area, described as constant and boring, radiating to his back. He has experienced multiple episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis over the past 12 hours.",
      "assessment": "The client is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His abdomen is tender to palpation with guarding. Bowel sounds are hypoactive in all quadrants. A faint bluish discoloration is noted around the umbilicus (Cullen's sign). Respiratory assessment reveals shallow respirations with crackles noted in the bilateral lung bases. His skin is cool and clammy to the touch. The client expresses significant anxiety about his condition. Vital signs: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 28, SpO2 92% on room air.",
      "recommendation": "Initiate immediate interventions: fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy, and pain management. Anticipate potential transfer to ICU. Immediately notify the healthcare provider of critical findings, including Cullen's sign, respiratory distress, and signs of shock. Prepare for potential complications such as ARDS or pseudocyst formation."

      "rationale": "Incorrect. While severe epigastric pain (9/10) is a primary symptom of acute pancreatitis due to pancreatic inflammation and autodigestion, it's an expected finding. The pain results from the release of pancreatic enzymes that irritate nerve endings. While aggressive pain management is crucial, it's not the most immediate concern compared to signs of hemorrhage, respiratory failure, or shock.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Nausea and vomiting are common in acute pancreatitis due to gastric hypomotility and chemical peritonitis caused by the leakage of pancreatic enzymes into the abdominal cavity. While these symptoms require management (NPO status, antiemetics, NG tube if severe), they are not as critical as signs of systemic collapse or internal bleeding.",

      "optionId": "opt_4",
      "rationale": "Correct. A faint bluish discoloration around the umbilicus (Cullen's sign) is a late and ominous sign indicative of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. This occurs when pancreatic enzymes erode blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate notification of the provider, preparation for aggressive resuscitation (blood products, fluid replacement), and potential surgical intervention to stop the bleeding.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Shallow respirations indicate respiratory distress, which can be caused by severe pain limiting chest excursion or, more critically, by the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a major cause of mortality in severe pancreatitis, resulting from systemic inflammation and capillary leak in the lungs. This finding requires immediate further assessment of oxygenation (ABGs, SpO2) and respiratory effort, and potential intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

In acute pancreatitis, this is a significant indicator of systemic inflammation leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability. This complication carries a high mortality rate and requires immediate intervention, including oxygen therapy, diuretics (if appropriate), and potential mechanical ventilation.",

In acute pancreatitis, this can result from profound hypovolemia due to third-spacing of fluid into the retroperitoneal space (caused by increased capillary permeability from inflammation) or from Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) leading to distributive shock. This indicates circulatory collapse and requires immediate fluid resuscitation (crystalloids, colloids), hemodynamic monitoring (BP, HR, CVP), and vasopressors if fluid resuscitation is insufficient.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. While anxiety is an expected psychosocial response to severe illness, pain, and hospitalization, it does not take priority over the immediate life-threatening physiological complications of hemorrhage, shock, and respiratory failure. The nurse should address the client's anxiety after stabilizing the client's physiological status.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Address anxiety with calm reassurance and clear explanations, but prioritize life-saving interventions first."
