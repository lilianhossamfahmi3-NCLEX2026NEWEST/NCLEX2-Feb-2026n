    "scenario": "A 48-year-old male client is admitted with acute pancreatitis. History of cholelithiasis and reports drinking 2-3 beers on weekends. The client reports a pain level of 9/10 in the epigastric area, which he describes as constant and boring, radiating to his back. He has had multiple episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis over the past 12 hours. The client is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His abdomen is tender to palpation with guarding. Bowel sounds are hypoactive in all quadrants. A faint bluish discoloration is noted around the umbilicus. Respiratory assessment reveals shallow respirations with crackles noted in the bilateral lung bases. His skin is cool and clammy to the touch. The client expresses significant anxiety about his condition.",

            "rationale": "Incorrect. Severe epigastric pain (9/10) is a hallmark and expected symptom of acute pancreatitis due to auto-digestion and inflammation of the pancreas. While it requires aggressive pain management, it is not an indicator of a life-threatening complication requiring more immediate follow-up than signs of hemorrhage or respiratory failure."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Nausea and vomiting are classic, expected findings in acute pancreatitis, caused by gastric hypomotility and chemical peritonitis. This finding requires management (NPO status, antiemetics, NG tube) but is not as critical as signs of systemic collapse."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Abdominal tenderness and guarding are characteristic signs of peritoneal irritation from the inflamed pancreas. This is an expected physical assessment finding for acute pancreatitis and confirms the diagnosis but does not signify a new, immediate life-threatening complication."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "rationale": "Correct. A faint bluish discoloration around the umbilicus is known as Cullen's sign. This is a late and ominous finding indicative of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the inflamed pancreas, a life-threatening emergency. This requires immediate notification of the provider and preparation for aggressive resuscitation and potential surgical intervention."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "rationale": "Correct. Shallow respirations indicate respiratory distress. This can be caused by severe pain limiting chest excursion or, more critically, it can be an early sign of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a major cause of mortality in severe pancreatitis. This finding requires immediate further assessment of oxygenation and respiratory effort."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "rationale": "Correct. Crackles in the lung bases are an abnormal finding suggesting fluid accumulation in the alveoli. In the context of acute pancreatitis, this is a significant indicator of systemic inflammation leading to pulmonary edema or the onset of ARDS. This complication carries a high mortality rate and requires immediate intervention."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_7",
            "rationale": "Correct. Cool, clammy skin is a classic sign of shock. In acute pancreatitis, this can result from profound hypovolemia due to third-spacing of fluid into the retroperitoneal space or from Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). This indicates circulatory collapse and requires immediate fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic monitoring."

While the nurse must address the client's anxiety, it does not take priority over the immediate life-threatening physiological complications of hemorrhage, shock, and respiratory failure."
