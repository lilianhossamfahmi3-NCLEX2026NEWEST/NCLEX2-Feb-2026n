The root cause of the atelectasis is ineffective deep breathing and coughing due to uncontrolled incisional pain (rated 6/10), which is preventing adequate lung expansion. The priority action is to address this underlying cause. By administering the prescribed analgesic for moderate pain, the nurse can reduce the client's pain, enabling them to participate in essential pulmonary hygiene measures like deep breathing, coughing, and incentive spirometry, which will directly treat the atelectasis.",

This hypoventilation is the cause of the atelectasis. Treating the pain is the priority intervention as it is the barrier to effective treatment (pulmonary hygiene).
