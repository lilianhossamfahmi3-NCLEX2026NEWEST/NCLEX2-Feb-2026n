Intravenous calcium gluconate is the priority intervention because it rapidly stabilizes the myocardium by antagonizing the cardiotoxic effects of potassium. While it does not lower the serum potassium level, it provides immediate cardioprotection, allowing time for other therapies to take effect.",
        "incorrect": "While other options are valid treatments for hyperkalemia, they are not the first-line intervention in the presence of cardiac toxicity. Insulin and dextrose shift potassium into the cells, but this takes 20-30 minutes to begin working. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate works slowly in the gastrointestinal tract and is not for emergent situations. Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for potassium removal but requires time for preparation and initiation. The immediate, life-saving action is to stabilize the heart.",
