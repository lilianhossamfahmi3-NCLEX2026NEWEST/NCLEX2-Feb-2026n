    "correct": "The client's severe hyperkalemia (7.1 mEq/L) and associated ECG changes (tall, peaked T waves) indicate a critical risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole due to myocardial membrane instability. IV calcium gluconate is the priority as it rapidly stabilizes the myocardium by counteracting potassium's cardiotoxic effects. It doesn't lower potassium but provides immediate cardioprotection, allowing time for other treatments. The peaked T waves are caused by the effect of hyperkalemia on cardiac myocyte repolarization, shortening the refractory period and increasing the risk of arrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "While other options treat hyperkalemia, they aren't first-line with cardiac toxicity. Insulin and dextrose shift potassium intracellularly, taking 20-30 minutes. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate works slowly in the GI tract and isn't for emergencies. Hemodialysis removes potassium but requires preparation. Immediate myocardial stabilization is key.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate removes potassium via the GI tract. Its slow onset (hours) makes it unsuitable for life-threatening hyperkalemia with ECG changes.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the large intestine, leading to potassium excretion in the feces. This process is relatively slow and unpredictable, making it inappropriate for acute, severe hyperkalemia where rapid potassium reduction is needed. The onset of action can be delayed by several hours, and its effectiveness can be affected by factors such as bowel motility and the presence of other medications."

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Incorrect. IV regular insulin and dextrose shift potassium intracellularly, lowering serum levels. However, its onset (20-30 minutes) is too slow for the immediate risk of cardiac arrest. Myocardial stabilization is the first priority.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which promotes the movement of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin can lower blood glucose levels. While effective in reducing serum potassium, the onset of action is not immediate, and it does not directly address the myocardial instability caused by hyperkalemia. Calcium gluconate provides immediate cardioprotection while awaiting the effects of insulin and dextrose."

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. Peaked T waves with potassium of 7.1 mEq/L signify a high risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. Calcium gluconate directly antagonizes hyperkalemia's effect on the cardiac cell membrane, providing immediate stabilization and preventing fatal arrhythmias. This is the most critical first intervention.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential of cardiac cells, making them less excitable and less susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia. This helps to stabilize the myocardium and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Calcium gluconate does not lower serum potassium levels but provides immediate cardioprotection, buying time for other interventions to reduce potassium levels."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Incorrect. Hemodialysis is effective for removing potassium and correcting metabolic acidosis in AKI, but it's not the most immediate intervention. Preparing for dialysis takes time. The client needs immediate intervention to prevent cardiac arrest while awaiting dialysis.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Hemodialysis is the most effective method for removing potassium from the body and correcting electrolyte imbalances in patients with AKI. However, it requires specialized equipment, trained personnel, and vascular access, which can take time to establish. In the setting of severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes, immediate interventions such as calcium gluconate are necessary to stabilize the myocardium while preparing for dialysis."
