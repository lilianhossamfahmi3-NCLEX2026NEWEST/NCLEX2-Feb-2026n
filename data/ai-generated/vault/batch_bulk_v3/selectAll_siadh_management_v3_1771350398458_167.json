    "correctReason": "The management of severe, symptomatic SIADH focuses on patient safety, correcting the underlying cause of water retention, and carefully increasing the serum sodium level. Key nursing actions include implementing seizure precautions due to cerebral edema from severe hyponatremia, restricting fluid intake to prevent further water retention, administering hypertonic saline cautiously to raise serum sodium, and performing frequent neurological assessments to monitor for changes in condition or complications of treatment.",

      {
        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "**Correct.** The client's serum sodium is critically low at 116 mEq/L, and they have a history of seizure. This indicates cerebral edema, placing them at very high risk for further seizure activity. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside, oxygen readily available) is a critical safety intervention to prevent injury during a seizure. Hyponatremia causes neuronal swelling and increased excitability, leading to seizures.",

        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "**Incorrect.** SIADH is a state of dilutional hyponatremia caused by excessive water retention due to the overproduction or inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Encouraging the intake of free water, which is hypotonic, would worsen fluid retention, further dilute the serum sodium, and increase cerebral edema, potentially leading to catastrophic neurological outcomes. The pathophysiology involves the kidneys retaining excessive water, leading to decreased serum osmolality and hyponatremia.",

        "rationale": "**Correct.** For clients with severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L with neurological symptoms like seizures or coma), the slow and controlled infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is indicated to gradually increase the serum sodium level. It must be administered slowly and via an infusion pump to prevent rapid sodium correction, which could cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). ODS occurs when rapid correction of hyponatremia causes fluid to shift out of brain cells, leading to myelin damage.",

        "rationale": "**Correct.** Fluid restriction is a cornerstone of treatment for SIADH. By limiting free water intake (e.g., to 800-1000 mL/day), the body can begin to excrete excess water through insensible losses and urination, allowing the serum sodium concentration to gradually increase. This reduces the dilutional effect of excess fluid volume on serum sodium.",

The kidneys in a client with SIADH will excrete the sodium from the saline while retaining the water, which can paradoxically worsen the hyponatremia and fluid overload. A rapid bolus would be especially dangerous, exacerbating the fluid overload and potentially leading to pulmonary edema and further neurological compromise.",

Frequent and thorough neurological assessments (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale, level of consciousness, orientation, pupillary response, motor strength) are essential to monitor for deterioration or improvement and to detect early signs of complications like ODS during treatment. These assessments help to identify changes in neurological status that may require immediate intervention.",
