The client is lethargic and oriented only to person. The nurse notes intermittent muscle twitching in the upper extremities. There is no peripheral edema, and lung sounds are clear. The healthcare provider has diagnosed the client with SIADH.\n\n**Admission Laboratory Results:**\n*   Serum Sodium: 116 mEq/L (1.16 mmol/L)\n*   Serum Osmolality: 258 mOsm/kg\n*   Urine Specific Gravity: 1.028\n*   Urine Osmolality: 450 mOsm/kg",

        "correctReason": "The management of severe, symptomatic SIADH focuses on patient safety, correcting the underlying cause of water retention, and carefully increasing the serum sodium level. Key nursing actions include implementing seizure precautions due to cerebral edema from severe hyponatremia, restricting fluid intake to prevent further water retention, administering hypertonic saline cautiously to raise serum sodium, and performing frequent neurological assessments to monitor for changes in condition or complications of treatment.",

            {
                "optionId": "opt_1",
                "correct": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's serum sodium is critically low at 116 mEq/L and they have already had a seizure. This indicates cerebral edema, placing them at very high risk for further seizure activity. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside) is a critical safety intervention."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. SIADH is a state of dilutional hyponatremia caused by excessive water retention, not dehydration. Encouraging the intake of free water, which is hypotonic, would worsen fluid retention, further dilute the serum sodium, and increase cerebral edema, potentially leading to catastrophic neurological outcomes."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "correct": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. For clients with severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L with neurological symptoms like seizures or coma), the infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is indicated. It must be administered slowly and via an infusion pump to prevent rapid sodium correction, which could cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "correct": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. Fluid restriction is the cornerstone of treatment for SIADH. By limiting free water intake (e.g., to 800-1000 mL/day), the body can begin to excrete excess water through insensible losses and urination, allowing the serum sodium concentration to gradually increase."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering isotonic saline (0.9% NS) is contraindicated in SIADH. The kidneys in a client with SIADH will excrete the sodium from the saline while retaining the water, which can paradoxically worsen the hyponatremia and fluid overload. A rapid bolus would be especially dangerous."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "correct": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's lethargy, confusion, and seizure activity are direct results of cerebral edema from hyponatremia. Frequent and thorough neurological assessments (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale, level of consciousness, orientation, pupillary response) are essential to monitor for deterioration or improvement and to detect early signs of complications like ODS during treatment."

                "correct": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic form of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It is used to treat Diabetes Insipidus, a condition characterized by a *deficiency* of ADH. Administering it to a client with SIADH, a condition of *excess* ADH, would severely worsen the fluid retention and hyponatremia."
