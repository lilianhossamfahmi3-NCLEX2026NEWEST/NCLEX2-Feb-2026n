During a scheduled neurological assessment at 1430, the client reports a new, severe headache and appears increasingly lethargic.

    "correct": "The client's presentation (Situation) of a new, severe headache, increased lethargy, and significant hypertension (BP 190/105 mmHg) 30 minutes after alteplase administration strongly suggests a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (Background). Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain. The sudden onset of these symptoms indicates a potential life-threatening complication (Assessment). The priority nursing action (Recommendation) is to immediately stop the alteplase infusion to prevent further bleeding and notify the primary healthcare provider STAT. This allows for immediate intervention, including an emergent CT scan to confirm the ICH and potential neurosurgical consultation. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs when blood vessels in the brain rupture, leading to blood accumulation within the skull. This increases intracranial pressure (ICP), causing further brain damage and neurological deficits. Prompt intervention is crucial to minimize brain damage and improve patient outcomes. Clinical Pearl: Always suspect ICH in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy who develop sudden neurological changes, headache, or hypertension.",
    "incorrect": "Administering labetalol, preparing for a CT scan, or providing comfort measures are not the priority actions. These actions do not address the underlying cause of the client's deterioration, which is the potential intracranial hemorrhage caused by alteplase. Continuing the infusion while addressing other symptoms would worsen the hemorrhage. Comfort measures are inappropriate as they delay life-saving interventions.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. While controlling blood pressure is important, it is secondary to stopping the alteplase infusion. The elevated blood pressure is likely a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion in the setting of increased intracranial pressure. Administering an antihypertensive without addressing the underlying cause could worsen the situation.",
