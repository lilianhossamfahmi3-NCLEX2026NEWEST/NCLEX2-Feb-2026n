During a scheduled neurological assessment, the client reports a new, severe headache and appears increasingly lethargic. Vital signs are: BP 190/105 mmHg, HR 58 bpm, RR 14/min, SpO2 96% on room air.

The immediate, priority nursing action is to stop the infusion of alteplase to prevent further bleeding. After stopping the infusion, the nurse must urgently notify the provider to facilitate emergency intervention, including an emergent CT scan and potential neurosurgical consultation.",
        "incorrect": "While controlling blood pressure is crucial during and after stroke treatment, and a CT scan will be needed, these are not the first actions. The root cause of the client's deterioration is likely the thrombolytic agent causing a brain bleed. Continuing the infusion while addressing other symptoms would worsen the hemorrhage. Comfort measures are inappropriate as they delay life-saving interventions.",

While the blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg is critically high and requires treatment, it is likely a symptom of increased intracranial pressure from a hemorrhage caused by the alteplase. Administering an antihypertensive without first stopping the causative agent (alteplase) fails to address the primary life-threatening problem and could delay definitive care.",
