  "passage": "A 62-year-old male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of a severe, 'blinding' headache. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He states he ran out of his lisinopril a week ago. On assessment, the client appears anxious and restless. His skin is flushed and warm. He is slurring his words and reports substernal chest pressure that started 30 minutes ago. Vital signs are: BP 224/130 mmHg, HR 112, RR 22, SpO2 95% on room air. The client reports feeling nauseous. The provider performed a fundoscopic exam, which revealed papilledema. The Foley catheter placed on arrival has drained 15 mL of urine in the past hour.",

    "correct": "A hypertensive emergency, defined as SBP >180 mmHg and/or DBP >120 mmHg with end-organ damage, requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible harm. The selected findings indicate acute damage. Severe headache and papilledema suggest hypertensive encephalopathy (cerebral edema). Slurred speech indicates potential stroke (CVA). Substernal chest pressure suggests myocardial ischemia due to increased cardiac workload. Oliguria (15 mL/hr) signifies acute kidney injury (AKI) from reduced renal perfusion. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality.",
    "incorrect": "While the elevated BP confirms hypertensive crisis, the question asks for *evidence* of end-organ damage. BP is the *cause*, not the effect. History of diabetes, CKD, and medication non-adherence are contributing factors but not acute signs of organ damage. Focus on identifying *new* physiological changes indicating organ dysfunction. Failing to recognize end-organ damage can lead to delayed treatment and worsened outcomes.",

        "label": "severe, 'blinding' headache",
        "content": "CORRECT: Severe headache, especially described as 'blinding,' is a key symptom of hypertensive encephalopathy. The extreme BP overwhelms cerebral autoregulation, leading to vasogenic edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This manifests as headache, altered mental status, and potentially seizures.",
