    "passage": "A 62-year-old male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of a severe, 'blinding' headache. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He states he ran out of his lisinopril a week ago. On assessment, the client appears anxious and restless. His skin is flushed and warm. He is slurring his words and reports substernal chest pressure that started 30 minutes ago. Vital signs are: BP 224/130 mmHg, HR 112, RR 22, SpO2 95% on room air. The client reports feeling nauseous. The provider performed a fundoscopic exam, which revealed papilledema. The Foley catheter placed on arrival has drained 15 mL of urine in the past hour.",

        "correct": "A hypertensive emergency is defined by severely elevated blood pressure accompanied by evidence of acute, ongoing end-organ damage. The selected findings are all direct indicators of such damage. The severe headache and papilledema suggest hypertensive encephalopathy with increased intracranial pressure. Slurred speech points to a potential cerebrovascular accident (stroke). Substernal chest pressure indicates myocardial ischemia from the extreme cardiac workload. Finally, the scant urine output (oliguria) signifies acute kidney injury. These cues collectively confirm a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention to carefully lower the blood pressure.",
        "incorrect": "While the blood pressure reading of 224/130 mmHg is critically high and defines the condition, the question asks to identify the *evidence of end-organ damage* resulting from it. The BP is the cause, not the effect. The client's past medical history and medication non-adherence are important contributing factors and provide context, but they are not acute findings of current organ damage. Recognizing the distinction between causative/historical factors and acute physiological consequences is crucial for prioritizing care.",
