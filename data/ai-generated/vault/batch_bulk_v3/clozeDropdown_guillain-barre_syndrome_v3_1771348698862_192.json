        "correct": "The correct plan of care for a client in the acute phase of Guillain-Barre Syndrome prioritizes airway, breathing, and circulation. The greatest threat is respiratory failure due to paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles; therefore, monitoring respiratory rate and vital capacity is the top priority. Autonomic dysfunction is common and can lead to cardiovascular instability, manifesting as orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, and various cardiac dysrhythmias. Interventions to prevent complications of immobility, such as passive range-of-motion exercises and repositioning, are crucial to prevent contractures, pressure injuries, and venous thromboembolism. Finally, because cranial nerve involvement can cause dysphagia and an inability to manage secretions, having suction equipment and a basic airway adjunct at the bedside is a critical safety precaution to prevent aspiration.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices reflect interventions that are either secondary in priority (e.g., monitoring sensory deficits), inappropriate for the acute phase (e.g., active exercises), or not directly related to immediate bedside safety (e.g., preparing for a G-tube). While many of the incorrect options are components of care for a GBS client, they do not represent the most critical priorities for preventing acute, life-threatening complications.",
