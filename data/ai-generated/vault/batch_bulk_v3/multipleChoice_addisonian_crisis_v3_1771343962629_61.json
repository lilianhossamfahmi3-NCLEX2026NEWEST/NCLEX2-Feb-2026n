    "stem": "A 45-year-old client with a known history of Addison's disease is brought to the emergency department at 14:30 with profound weakness, confusion, and abdominal pain. The client reports a 'stomach flu' for the past two days with vomiting and diarrhea. Vital signs are: BP 84/48 mmHg, HR 126 bpm, RR 24/min, and T 101.2°F (38.4°C). A point-of-care glucose is 58 mg/dL. An ECG monitor shows tall, peaked T-waves. Which action is the nurse's immediate priority?",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The immediate priority is administering IV hydrocortisone. This directly addresses the Addisonian crisis, characterized by acute cortisol deficiency. Cortisol is vital for maintaining vascular tone, BP, and glucose. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands don't produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. The 'stomach flu' acted as a stressor, precipitating the crisis. The profound weakness, confusion, hypotension, and hypoglycemia are all signs of cortisol deficiency. Replacing cortisol is life-saving, stabilizing hemodynamics and facilitating the effectiveness of other treatments. ClinicalPearl: Always consider Addisonian crisis in patients with known Addison's presenting with acute illness and hypotension.",
    "incorrect": "While fluid resuscitation, correcting hypoglycemia, and managing hyperkalemia are important, they address consequences, not the root cause. The circulatory collapse won't resolve without glucocorticoid replacement. Hydrocortisone is the critical first step. ClinicalPearl: Remember the 3 S's of Addison's: Sugar (hypoglycemia), Salt (hyponatremia), and Steroids (lack of cortisol).",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. While crucial for hypotension (84/48 mmHg) and hypovolemia due to aldosterone deficiency, it's not the immediate priority. The shock is primarily due to cortisol deficiency, needed for vascular tone. Without cortisol, fluid resuscitation is less effective. Aldosterone promotes sodium and water retention; its deficiency leads to fluid loss and hypotension. ClinicalPearl: Monitor for fluid overload during fluid resuscitation, especially in patients with cardiac or renal compromise.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Correct. The client is experiencing an Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening emergency due to acute adrenal insufficiency. Rapid IV hydrocortisone is the life-saving priority to replace deficient cortisol. This directly treats the underlying cause of circulatory collapse and stabilizes hemodynamics. Hydrocortisone acts as both a glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid, addressing both cortisol and aldosterone deficiencies. ClinicalPearl: Administer hydrocortisone before or concurrently with fluid resuscitation for optimal effect.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Incorrect. Correcting hypoglycemia (glucose 58 mg/dL) with IV dextrose is important, especially with confusion. However, the most immediate threat is cardiovascular collapse indicated by severe hypotension. Hydrocortisone will also help raise blood glucose by stimulating gluconeogenesis, in addition to its primary effect on blood pressure. ClinicalPearl: Monitor blood glucose closely after hydrocortisone administration, as hyperglycemia can occur.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Incorrect. Tall, peaked T-waves suggest hyperkalemia, common in Addisonian crisis due to aldosterone deficiency. While IV insulin and glucose is a standard treatment for severe hyperkalemia, it's not the initial priority. Hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation will help correct hyperkalemia by improving renal perfusion and restoring hormonal balance. Addressing the shock is the most urgent need. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion; its deficiency leads to hyperkalemia. ClinicalPearl: Obtain an ECG to monitor for hyperkalemia-related arrhythmias.",
