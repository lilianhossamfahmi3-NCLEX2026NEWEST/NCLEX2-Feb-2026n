        "stem": "A 45-year-old client with a known history of Addison's disease is brought to the emergency department with profound weakness, confusion, and abdominal pain. The client had a 'stomach flu' for the past two days with vomiting and diarrhea. Vital signs are: BP 84/48 mmHg, HR 126 bpm, RR 24/min, and T 101.2°F (38.4°C). A point-of-care glucose is 58 mg/dL. An ECG monitor shows tall, peaked T-waves. Which action is the nurse's immediate priority?",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The immediate priority in an Addisonian crisis is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone. This action directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology of the crisis: an acute deficiency of cortisol. Cortisol is essential for maintaining vascular tone, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. Replacing it is the definitive, life-saving intervention that will begin to correct the shock state, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.",
        "incorrect": "While fluid resuscitation, correction of hypoglycemia, and management of hyperkalemia are all critical components of managing an Addisonian crisis, they treat the consequences rather than the root cause. The profound circulatory collapse will not resolve without glucocorticoid replacement. Administering hydrocortisone is the most critical first step that facilitates the effectiveness of the other treatments.",

            {
                "label": "A",
                "content": "This is incorrect. While administering an IV fluid bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride is a crucial intervention to address the severe hypotension (84/48 mmHg) and hypovolemia caused by aldosterone deficiency, it is not the most immediate priority. The shock state is primarily driven by the lack of cortisol, which is needed to maintain vascular tone. Without cortisol replacement, fluid resuscitation alone will be less effective.",

            {
                "label": "B",
                "content": "This is correct. The client is experiencing an Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening emergency caused by an acute adrenal insufficiency. The immediate, life-saving priority is the rapid administration of IV hydrocortisone to replace the deficient cortisol. This action is paramount as it directly treats the underlying cause of the circulatory collapse and helps stabilize the client's hemodynamic status.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. Correcting the hypoglycemia (glucose 58 mg/dL) with IV dextrose is important, especially given the client's confusion. However, the most immediate threat to life is the profound cardiovascular collapse indicated by the severe hypotension. Administering hydrocortisone will also help raise blood glucose levels by stimulating gluconeogenesis, in addition to its primary effect on blood pressure.",

            {
                "label": "D",
                "content": "This is incorrect. The tall, peaked T-waves suggest hyperkalemia, a common finding in Addisonian crisis due to aldosterone deficiency. While IV insulin and glucose is a standard treatment for severe hyperkalemia, it is not the initial priority in this scenario. The primary interventions of IV hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation will help correct hyperkalemia by improving renal perfusion and restoring hormonal balance. Addressing the shock is the most urgent need.",
