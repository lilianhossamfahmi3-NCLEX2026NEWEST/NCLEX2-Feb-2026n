    "correct": "The client's sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia (122/min), tachypnea (30/min), and hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) strongly suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE). The priority is to address the impaired gas exchange immediately. Following the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, improving oxygenation is paramount. Administering high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask will increase the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), counteracting the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch caused by the PE. This reduces hypoxemia, decreases the work of breathing, and lowers myocardial oxygen demand. ClinicalPearl: Remember the classic triad of PE: sudden dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis (though hemoptysis is not always present).",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are important in managing a suspected PE, they are not the *first* priority. Diagnostic procedures (CT scan, labs) and therapeutic interventions (heparin, positioning) should follow after stabilizing the client's respiratory status. Sending a hypoxic client for a CT scan is unsafe. Anticoagulation is essential but doesn't provide immediate respiratory support. Positioning is supportive but secondary to oxygen administration.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. While a spiral CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosing PE, it's a diagnostic step. The client's SpO2 of 88% indicates instability. Stabilize respiratory status *before* transport.",

    "deepPathophysiologyRationale": "A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a thrombus (blood clot), often originating from the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), dislodges and travels to the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow to the lungs. This obstruction leads to a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. Alveoli are ventilated (receiving air) but not perfused (receiving blood), hindering gas exchange. The body attempts to compensate by increasing respiratory rate (tachypnea) and heart rate (tachycardia). However, the impaired gas exchange results in hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), leading to cellular hypoxia and potential organ damage. The pleuritic chest pain arises from inflammation and irritation of the pleura due to the pulmonary infarction or ischemia. The anxiety and restlessness are due to the hypoxemia and the body's stress response. Crackles may be present due to developing pulmonary edema from increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The cool, pale skin suggests poor perfusion due to the compromised cardiac output secondary to the PE.",
    "clinicalPearls": "Always consider PE in post-operative patients presenting with sudden dyspnea and chest pain. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications. Remember to assess for risk factors for DVT, such as prolonged immobilization, surgery, and hypercoagulable states. Use the Wells score or Geneva score to assess the probability of PE. Military Time Conversion: Not applicable in this scenario."
