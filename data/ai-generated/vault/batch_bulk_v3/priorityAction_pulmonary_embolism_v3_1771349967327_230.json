The most critical, life-saving priority is to address the impaired gas exchange. According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, correcting the client's breathing and oxygenation status is the first step. Administering high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask will help correct the hypoxemia caused by the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch from the embolism, reduce the work of breathing, and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.",

Diagnostic procedures (CT scan, labs) and therapeutic interventions (heparin, positioning) should only be performed after the client's life-threatening hypoxemia is addressed. Sending an unstable, hypoxic client for a CT scan is unsafe. Anticoagulation is a key treatment but does not provide the immediate respiratory support that oxygen does. Positioning is a supportive measure but is secondary to providing supplemental oxygen.",
