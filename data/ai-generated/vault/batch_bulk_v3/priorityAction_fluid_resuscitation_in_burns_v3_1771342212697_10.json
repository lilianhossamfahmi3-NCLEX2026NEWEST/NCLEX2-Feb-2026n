    "correct": "The priority action is to prepare for immediate endotracheal intubation. The client's hoarse voice, facial burns, soot around the nares, and stridor are critical indicators of inhalation injury and potential airway obstruction due to laryngeal edema. Inhalation injuries cause direct thermal damage and inflammation to the airway. This inflammation leads to mucosal edema, bronchospasm, and increased secretions, potentially causing complete airway obstruction. Securing the airway is paramount to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, following the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework. Delaying intubation can result in a 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' scenario, leading to hypoxia, brain damage, and death.",
