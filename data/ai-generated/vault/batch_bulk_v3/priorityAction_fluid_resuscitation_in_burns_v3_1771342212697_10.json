        "correct": "The highest priority action is to prepare for immediate endotracheal intubation. The client's hoarse voice, facial burns, and soot around the nares are classic signs of a significant inhalation injury. This indicates swelling of the upper airways (laryngeal edema), which can rapidly progress to complete airway obstruction. Securing the airway is the most critical intervention according to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework. Delay can make intubation difficult or impossible, leading to a life-threatening emergency.",
        "incorrect": "While fluid resuscitation, pain management, and cardiac monitoring are all essential components of burn care, they are secondary to securing a patent airway. The client is exhibiting clear signs of impending airway compromise, which is the most immediate threat to life. Applying wet dressings is contraindicated as it can induce severe hypothermia.",
