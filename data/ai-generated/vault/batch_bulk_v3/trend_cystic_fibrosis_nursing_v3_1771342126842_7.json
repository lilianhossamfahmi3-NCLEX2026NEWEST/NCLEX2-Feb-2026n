Increased RR (26 to 32/min), increased O2 requirement (2 to 4 L/min), decreased SpO2 (92% to 91% despite increased O2), and diminished breath sounds indicate deteriorating gas exchange. Mucus plugging, atelectasis, or progression of the exacerbation are likely. While WBC count decreased, pulmonary function is the priority.",

    ],
    "pathophysiology": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes thick mucus accumulation in the lungs, leading to chronic infections and inflammation. Pulmonary exacerbations involve increased mucus production, airway obstruction, and bacterial colonization. Despite antibiotic therapy, inflammation and mucus plugging can worsen gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia and increased work of breathing. The body attempts to compensate by increasing respiratory rate, but eventually, respiratory muscle fatigue can occur, further compromising ventilation. Diminished breath sounds indicate reduced airflow to affected lung regions due to mucus plugging or atelectasis. Hyperglycemia can occur due to pancreatic insufficiency and insulin resistance, leading to CFRD.",
    "clinicalPearl": "In CF exacerbations, monitor respiratory status closely. Increased RR, decreased SpO2, increased work of breathing, and changes in breath sounds indicate worsening pulmonary function. Prompt intervention, including airway clearance techniques, oxygen therapy, and antibiotics, is crucial to prevent respiratory failure."
