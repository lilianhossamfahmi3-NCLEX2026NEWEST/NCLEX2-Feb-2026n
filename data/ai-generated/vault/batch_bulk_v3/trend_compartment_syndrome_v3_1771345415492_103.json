    "correct": "The combination of findings—pain out of proportion to the injury and unresponsive to opioids, the onset of paresthesia (numbness and tingling), and pain with passive muscle stretching—are hallmark signs of acute compartment syndrome. This condition involves swelling and increased pressure within a confined space (a muscle compartment), which compromises blood flow and nerve function. The increased pressure leads to ischemia and nerve compression. Muscle cells become ischemic and release inflammatory mediators, further exacerbating the swelling and pain. If left untreated, the sustained ischemia can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis, nerve damage, and potentially limb loss. It is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention (fasciotomy) to relieve the pressure and restore blood flow, preventing permanent limb damage, muscle necrosis, and nerve palsy.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings are either expected post-operative occurrences or are non-specific and less indicative of a limb-threatening emergency. While findings like mild tachycardia or slightly delayed capillary refill warrant continued monitoring, they do not carry the same immediate urgency as the classic signs of compartment syndrome which point directly to severe neurovascular compromise.",

Be vigilant for escalating pain, especially if it's unresponsive to analgesics.",
