        "correct": "The priority instruction relates to the most life-threatening adverse effect of desmopressin, which is water intoxication leading to dilutional hyponatremia. Desmopressin mimics antidiuretic hormone (ADH), causing renal tubules to reabsorb water. An excessive dose or failure to reduce fluid intake can lead to fluid volume excess and a dangerous drop in serum sodium. Early neurologic signs of hyponatremia include persistent headache, nausea, and confusion. These can progress to seizures, coma, and death. Therefore, teaching the client to immediately report these specific symptoms is the highest safety priority.",
        "incorrect": "While the other options are relevant aspects of care, they do not address the most immediate life-threatening risk. Monitoring for therapeutic effectiveness is important for dosage adjustments but is secondary to safety. Proper administration technique prevents local side effects but is not critical for immediate safety. Storage instructions are important for medication viability but do not supersede the need to monitor for a potentially fatal adverse reaction.",
