  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority instruction is to report persistent headache and confusion immediately. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analog of vasopressin, mimicking antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It enhances water reabsorption in the renal tubules, reducing urine output. However, excessive DDAVP or high fluid intake can lead to water intoxication and dilutional hyponatremia (low serum sodium). Hyponatremia causes cerebral edema, manifesting as headache, nausea, confusion, and, if untreated, seizures, coma, and death. Prompt reporting allows for immediate intervention (e.g., fluid restriction, sodium replacement) to prevent severe neurological sequelae.",
    "incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because while monitoring for decreased thirst and urinary frequency is important to assess the drug's effectiveness, it is not the priority. Addressing potential life-threatening adverse effects takes precedence. Option B is incorrect because alternating nostrils is a good practice to prevent local irritation, but it is not related to a life-threatening complication. Option D is incorrect because while proper storage is important for medication stability, it is not the priority instruction related to patient safety and a potentially fatal adverse effect. Some formulations of DDAVP do not require refrigeration.",
