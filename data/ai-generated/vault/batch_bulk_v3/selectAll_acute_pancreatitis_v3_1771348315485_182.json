    "stem": "A 45-year-old male is admitted to the medical-surgical unit from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The client reports a sudden onset of severe, boring epigastric pain that radiates to his back. Assessment findings include: temperature 100.8°F (38.2°C), heart rate 118/min, respiratory rate 24/min, blood pressure 98/68 mmHg, and SpO2 94% on room air. The abdomen is distended and tender to light palpation. Laboratory results show serum lipase of 1,200 U/L and amylase of 850 U/L. The nurse is developing the plan of care. Which interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The priority interventions for acute pancreatitis focus on resting the pancreas, managing pain, providing aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent shock, and monitoring for life-threatening systemic complications. Maintaining NPO status prevents the stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion. Aggressive IV hydration with an isotonic crystalloid like Lactated Ringer's is critical to combat third-spacing and hypovolemia. Severe pain is a hallmark symptom requiring potent IV analgesics like hydromorphone. Acute pancreatitis can cause a severe systemic inflammatory response, leading to complications like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS); therefore, frequent respiratory assessment is essential for early detection.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that stimulate the pancreas or could cause further harm are contraindicated. A high-fat diet would markedly increase pancreatic stimulation, worsening the condition. Pancreatic enzymes are used for exocrine insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis, not the acute phase. While observing for signs of hemorrhagic pancreatitis (like Cullen's sign) is important, frequent abdominal palpation is contraindicated as it can exacerbate pain and inflammation.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is correct. The pain associated with acute pancreatitis is severe due to chemical peritonitis and inflammation. IV opioids, such as hydromorphone, are essential for effective pain management, which reduces patient distress and decreases metabolic demand."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. Dietary fat is a potent stimulator of cholecystokinin (CCK) release, which in turn stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion. Introducing food, especially high-fat food, would exacerbate the pancreatitis. The client must be kept NPO."

                "explanation": "This is correct. A primary goal in treating acute pancreatitis is to suppress pancreatic exocrine secretion. Keeping the client NPO prevents the release of secretin and CCK from the duodenum, thereby resting the inflamed pancreas and promoting healing."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (e.g., pancrelipase) is indicated for chronic pancreatitis, where there is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is not used in acute pancreatitis, where the goal is to reduce pancreatic activity."

                "explanation": "This is incorrect. While the nurse should observe for signs of hemorrhagic pancreatitis such as Cullen's sign (periumbilical bruising), frequent or deep palpation of the abdomen is contraindicated. It can increase pain significantly and may worsen inflammation."

Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid is a cornerstone of therapy to maintain organ perfusion and prevent complications like acute kidney injury and shock."
