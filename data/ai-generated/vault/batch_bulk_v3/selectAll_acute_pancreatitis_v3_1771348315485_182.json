  "stem": "A 45-year-old male is admitted to the medical-surgical unit from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The client reports a sudden onset of severe, boring epigastric pain that radiates to his back. Assessment findings include: temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate 118/min, respiratory rate 24/min, blood pressure 98/68 mmHg, and SpO2 94% on room air. The abdomen is distended and tender to light palpation. Laboratory results show serum lipase of 1,200 U/L and amylase of 850 U/L. The nurse is developing the plan of care. Which interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority interventions for acute pancreatitis focus on resting the pancreas, managing pain, providing aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent hypovolemic shock, and monitoring for life-threatening systemic complications. Maintaining NPO status prevents the stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion. Aggressive IV hydration with an isotonic crystalloid like Lactated Ringer's is critical to combat third-spacing and hypovolemia. Severe pain is a hallmark symptom requiring potent IV analgesics like hydromorphone. Acute pancreatitis can cause a severe systemic inflammatory response, leading to complications like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS); therefore, frequent respiratory assessment is essential for early detection. The inflammatory process in acute pancreatitis can lead to increased capillary permeability and fluid shifts, resulting in hypovolemia and potential end-organ damage if not addressed promptly. Respiratory complications arise from diaphragmatic irritation and systemic inflammation affecting the pulmonary system.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that stimulate the pancreas or could cause further harm are contraindicated. A high-fat diet would markedly increase pancreatic stimulation, worsening the condition. Pancreatic enzymes are used for exocrine insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis, not the acute phase. While observing for signs of hemorrhagic pancreatitis (like Cullen's sign) is important, frequent abdominal palpation is contraindicated as it can exacerbate pain and inflammation. Palpation can increase intrapancreatic pressure and worsen the inflammatory response.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "Administer IV hydromorphone for pain control.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The severe pain in acute pancreatitis results from pancreatic inflammation, edema, and autodigestion. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid analgesic, is administered intravenously to provide rapid and effective pain relief. Pain management reduces patient distress and minimizes metabolic demands on the body, promoting healing. The pathophysiology involves the release of inflammatory mediators and the activation of pain receptors in the pancreas and surrounding tissues."

        "content": "Encourage a high-fat, high-protein diet as tolerated.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. A high-fat, high-protein diet stimulates the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), which in turn stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion. This exacerbates the inflammation and autodigestion of the pancreas. The client must be kept NPO to minimize pancreatic stimulation and allow the pancreas to rest and heal. The underlying pathophysiology involves the inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas itself, leading to tissue damage and inflammation. Introducing food, especially high-fat food, would worsen this process."

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Maintain strict Nothing Per Orem (NPO) status.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. A primary goal in treating acute pancreatitis is to suppress pancreatic exocrine secretion. Keeping the client NPO prevents the release of secretin and CCK from the duodenum, thereby resting the inflamed pancreas and promoting healing. This reduces the workload on the pancreas and allows it to recover from the inflammatory insult. The pathophysiology involves preventing further stimulation of pancreatic enzyme release, which contributes to the autodigestive process."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Administer pancreatic enzymes with meals.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (e.g., pancrelipase) is indicated for chronic pancreatitis, where there is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is not used in acute pancreatitis, where the goal is to reduce pancreatic activity. In acute pancreatitis, the pancreas is already inflamed and potentially leaking enzymes; administering more enzymes would not be beneficial and could worsen the condition. The underlying pathophysiology involves the inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas itself, leading to tissue damage and inflammation."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. While the nurse should observe for signs of hemorrhagic pancreatitis such as Cullen's sign (periumbilical bruising), frequent or deep palpation of the abdomen is contraindicated. It can increase pain significantly and may worsen inflammation. Palpation can increase intrapancreatic pressure and exacerbate the inflammatory response. Cullen's sign indicates retroperitoneal hemorrhage, but palpation will not aid in its detection and will cause unnecessary pain."

        "content": "Administer a bolus of Lactated Ringer's solution.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. The client is hypotensive (98/68 mmHg) and tachycardic (118/min), indicating hypovolemia due to third-spacing of fluid into the retroperitoneal space. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid like Lactated Ringer's is a cornerstone of therapy to maintain organ perfusion and prevent complications like acute kidney injury and shock. The inflammatory process increases capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts out of the intravascular space."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Acute pancreatitis can trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leading to serious complications like pleural effusions, atelectasis, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Frequent respiratory assessment is crucial for early detection of respiratory compromise. Pancreatic enzymes and inflammatory mediators can damage the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange."
