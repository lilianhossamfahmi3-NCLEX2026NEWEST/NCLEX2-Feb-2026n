    "scenario": "A 58-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of an acute anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The client has a history of hypertension and is a current smoker. Initial interventions included aspirin 324 mg chewed and oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. The client is now awaiting transport for an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During a reassessment, the nurse notes the client has become increasingly anxious and short of breath. The client is pale, and their skin is cool and clammy.\n\n**Current Vital Signs:**\n- Blood Pressure: 84/50 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 134 beats/minute, thready\n- Respiratory Rate: 28 breaths/minute\n- Oxygen Saturation: 89% on 2 L/min\n- Temperature: 36.8° C (98.2° F)\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n- Crackles are audible throughout the lower lung bases bilaterally.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, cool/clammy skin, pulmonary edema) secondary to a large MI. The oxygen saturation of 89% indicates significant hypoxemia, which is a life-threatening emergency that worsens myocardial ischemia and end-organ damage. According to airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles, addressing inadequate oxygenation is the immediate priority. Increasing the oxygen flow rate is a direct, non-invasive nursing action to improve tissue oxygenation and support vital organ function while other interventions are prepared."

        "B": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This action is incorrect and potentially harmful. While a fluid bolus is indicated for most types of shock (e.g., hypovolemic, septic), it is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock. The client's heart is failing as a pump, and adding more fluid volume (increasing preload) will overwhelm the ventricle, worsen the pulmonary edema (crackles), and precipitate acute respiratory failure."

        "C": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This action is incorrect as the immediate priority. While a high-Fowler's position can help ease the work of breathing by reducing venous return and allowing for better lung expansion, it can also exacerbate hypotension (BP 84/50 mmHg) by causing venous pooling. Correcting the life-threatening hypoxemia by increasing oxygen delivery is a more critical first step than repositioning."

        "D": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This action is incorrect and dangerous. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator used to relieve ischemic pain by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in clients with hypotension, specifically a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. Administering nitroglycerin to this client would cause a further, catastrophic drop in blood pressure and worsen cardiogenic shock."

        "E": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This action is incorrect as the immediate priority. Morphine is used in MI to relieve pain and anxiety, and its venodilating properties can reduce preload. However, a significant side effect is hypotension. Given the client's blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg, administering morphine is risky and could further compromise hemodynamic stability. The priority is to address the life-threatening hypoxia and hypotension."
