        "correct": "An MS relapse, or exacerbation, is defined as the appearance of new or the worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours and are not caused by fever or infection. The correct findings—worsening ataxia, new-onset diplopia, urinary incontinence, and new paresthesias (numbness/tingling)—are all hallmark neurological deficits caused by new inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). These acute or subacute changes reflect a new attack on the myelin sheath and are characteristic of a true relapse requiring potential intervention with corticosteroids.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent findings that do not fit the definition of an acute MS relapse. A fever suggests a 'pseudo-relapse,' where an underlying infection (e.g., a UTI) is causing a temporary worsening of symptoms without new CNS demyelination. Gradual cognitive decline over years is indicative of the chronic, progressive nature of the disease, not an acute relapse. Muscle rigidity and bradykinesia are classic signs of Parkinson's disease and are not characteristic of MS, which typically presents with spasticity.",
