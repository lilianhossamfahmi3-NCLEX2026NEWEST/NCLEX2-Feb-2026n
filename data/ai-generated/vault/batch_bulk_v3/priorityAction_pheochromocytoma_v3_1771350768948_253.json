This is a common and life-threatening complication following adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma due to the abrupt cessation of catecholamine secretion, which leads to sudden, widespread vasodilation and a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The immediate priority is to restore intravascular volume to improve blood pressure, cardiac output, and tissue perfusion. A rapid infusion of an isotonic fluid like 0.9% sodium chloride is the first-line intervention to combat this circulatory collapse.",

Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position would worsen hypotension. Delaying intervention to re-check vital signs is unsafe. While corticosteroid replacement may be necessary, it is not the priority intervention for acute hemodynamic instability.",
