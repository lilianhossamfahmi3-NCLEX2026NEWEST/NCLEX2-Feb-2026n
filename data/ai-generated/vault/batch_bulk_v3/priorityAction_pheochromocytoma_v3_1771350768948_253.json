    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hypotensive shock following adrenalectomy. The abrupt removal of the catecholamine-secreting tumor (pheochromocytoma) leads to a rapid decrease in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This causes widespread vasodilation and a significant drop in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The body, previously adapted to high catecholamine levels, can no longer maintain adequate blood pressure. The resulting hypotension leads to decreased tissue perfusion, triggering compensatory mechanisms like tachycardia (128 bpm) and increased respiratory rate (24/min). Oliguria (15 mL/hr) indicates decreased renal perfusion. Cool, clammy skin reflects peripheral vasoconstriction as the body attempts to shunt blood to vital organs. The immediate priority is to restore intravascular volume with a rapid infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride to increase preload, cardiac output, and blood pressure, thereby improving tissue perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they either worsen the client's condition or delay necessary treatment. Nitroprusside (a vasodilator) would further decrease blood pressure. High-Fowler's position exacerbates hypotension. Re-checking blood pressure delays critical intervention. While corticosteroids may be needed, they are not the immediate priority in managing acute hypotensive shock.",

      {
        "label": "A",
