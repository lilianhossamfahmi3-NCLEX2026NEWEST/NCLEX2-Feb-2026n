        "correct": "The client's presentation—including a history of HFrEF, orthopnea, labored breathing, bilateral crackles, S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and a markedly elevated BNP—is a classic picture of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) with pulmonary edema. The priority actions are to decrease preload and improve oxygenation. Administering IV furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, will rapidly promote diuresis and reduce the fluid volume overload causing pulmonary congestion. Applying BiPAP is critical to address the hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) and increased work of breathing; it improves oxygenation, decreases the work of breathing, and reduces both preload and afterload. To evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions, the nurse must monitor urine output to confirm diuresis from the furosemide and oxygen saturation to assess for improved gas exchange from both the diuretic and BiPAP.",
        "incorrect": "Other conditions are less likely. The normal troponin rules against ACS, and the afebrile status and cardiac signs make pneumonia less likely. While hypertensive, the fluid overload is the primary problem, not a hypertensive crisis itself. Interventions like administering a fluid bolus or a beta-blocker (metoprolol) are contraindicated as they would worsen the fluid overload and cardiac output, respectively. Monitoring parameters like daily weight are not sensitive enough for acute changes, and troponin/glucose levels are not directly related to the priority interventions for fluid management and oxygenation.",
