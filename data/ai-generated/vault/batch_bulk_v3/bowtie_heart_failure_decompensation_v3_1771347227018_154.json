    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) with pulmonary edema. The elevated BNP (1850 pg/mL) confirms significant cardiac strain and fluid overload. The priority is to reduce preload and improve oxygenation. Furosemide (A4) is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, promoting rapid diuresis and reducing fluid volume overload. BiPAP (A2) provides positive pressure ventilation, improving oxygenation by increasing alveolar recruitment and decreasing the work of breathing. It also reduces preload and afterload by decreasing venous return and left ventricular afterload. Monitoring urine output (P3) assesses the effectiveness of furosemide, while oxygen saturation (P1) evaluates the response to BiPAP and diuretic therapy. The goal is to achieve SpO2 > 90%.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a fluid bolus (A1) would exacerbate fluid overload and worsen pulmonary edema. Metoprolol (A3), a beta-blocker, is contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure due to its negative inotropic effects, which can further reduce cardiac output. While intubation (A5) may be necessary if the client's condition deteriorates, BiPAP is the preferred initial intervention. Hypertensive crisis (C2) is less likely as the primary issue is fluid overload. Anaphylaxis (C5) is ruled out by the absence of allergic symptoms. Normal troponin levels rule out Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) (C1). Community-Acquired Pneumonia (C4) is less likely given the absence of fever and the presence of clear signs of heart failure. Serum troponin levels (P2) and blood glucose (P5) are not relevant to the immediate management of ADHF. Daily weight (P4) is useful for long-term management but not for immediate assessment of treatment effectiveness.",
