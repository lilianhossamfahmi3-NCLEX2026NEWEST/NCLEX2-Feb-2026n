        "correct": "The priority in pre-operative myelomeningocele care is protecting the sac from injury and infection. Prone positioning minimizes pressure, preventing rupture and CSF leakage. Hip flexion, achieved with a small roll under the hips, reduces tension on the sac and exposed neural elements. Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through an opening in the vertebrae. This leaves the spinal cord exposed and vulnerable to trauma and infection, potentially leading to neurological deficits. Maintaining sac integrity is paramount to prevent further complications before surgical intervention. Clinical Pearl: Early surgical repair (within 24-48 hours) is crucial to minimize infection risk and optimize neurological outcomes. Question Trap: Students may choose options related to infection control, overlooking the immediate need to protect the sac from rupture.",

The infant is scheduled for surgery in 24 hours. There is a high risk of infection and neurological damage.\nAssessment: At 13:00, the infant is stable but requires pre-operative care to protect the sac from rupture and infection. The sac is intact, and there are no signs of CSF leakage or infection. Vital signs are within normal limits. The current dressing is clean and moist.\nRecommendation: Maintain prone positioning with slight hip flexion. Continue sterile, moist dressing changes every 2-4 hours using sterile saline. Monitor for any signs of sac leakage or infection (fever, irritability, redness). Avoid diapering. The next dressing change is due at 16:00. Notify the surgeon immediately of any concerns."
