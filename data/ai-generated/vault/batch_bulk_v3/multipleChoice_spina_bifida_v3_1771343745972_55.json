The infant is scheduled for surgical repair tomorrow morning.\nB: Born at 38 weeks gestation via scheduled C-section. Prenatal ultrasound identified the neural tube defect. Apgars were 8 and 9. The infant's parents are at the bedside and verbalize understanding of the diagnosis but appear anxious. They reside in a rural community, which presented a transportation barrier for prenatal specialist appointments.\nA: Vital signs are stable. A large, intact myelomeningocele sac (approx. 6 cm) is noted over the lumbosacral area, covered with a sterile, saline-moistened non-adherent dressing. No CSF leakage observed. Fontanelles are soft and flat. Good muscle tone and movement in upper extremities, with decreased spontaneous movement noted in lower extremities. Abdomen is soft, non-distended.\nR: Maintain strict prone positioning. Continue sterile, moist dressing changes every 2-4 hours. Initiate IV fluids and prepare for NPO status. Monitor vital signs and perform neurological checks, including head circumference measurement, every 2 hours. Provide emotional support and education to the parents."
