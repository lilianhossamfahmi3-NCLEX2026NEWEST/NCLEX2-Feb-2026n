    "correct": "The priority in pre-operative myelomeningocele care is protecting the sac from injury and infection. Prone positioning minimizes pressure, preventing rupture and CSF leakage. Hip flexion, achieved with a small roll under the hips, reduces tension on the sac and exposed neural elements. Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through an opening in the vertebrae. This leaves the spinal cord exposed and vulnerable to trauma and infection, potentially leading to neurological deficits. Maintaining sac integrity is paramount to prevent further complications before surgical intervention. ClinicalPearl: Early surgical repair (within 24-48 hours) is crucial to minimize infection risk and optimize neurological outcomes.",
