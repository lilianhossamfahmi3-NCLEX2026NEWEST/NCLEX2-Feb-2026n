A rapid bolus of isotonic saline can worsen hyponatremia due to dilution and may precipitate heart failure in a client with myxedema-related cardiac compromise. Fluid resuscitation should be done cautiously, and the primary issue of hyponatremia needs to be addressed.",
            "opt_2": "Correct. Myxedema coma is a state of severe hypothyroidism. The definitive treatment is rapid thyroid hormone replacement. Intravenous (IV) levothyroxine is the standard of care as oral absorption is unreliable in this critically ill state.",
            "opt_3": "Incorrect. The client is severely hypothermic, but active, rapid rewarming (like a forced-air warmer on high) must be avoided. Rapid rewarming can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a further drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse. Passive rewarming with standard blankets is the preferred and safer method.",
            "opt_4": "Correct. Myxedema coma causes profound cardiovascular and respiratory depression. The client exhibits bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory acidosis. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect life-threatening dysrhythmias, and continuous respiratory monitoring (including capnography if available) is needed to manage hypoventilation.",
            "opt_5": "Correct. Myxedema coma is a major physiologic stressor that can precipitate an adrenal crisis, especially in clients with autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's) who may have concurrent adrenal insufficiency. It is standard practice to administer IV glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone) until adrenal insufficiency can be ruled out, as administering thyroid hormone alone can worsen an adrenal crisis.",
            "opt_6": "Incorrect. Sedatives, opioids, and anesthetics are contraindicated in myxedema coma. These clients have an extremely heightened sensitivity to these medications, which can profoundly worsen the existing respiratory depression and carbon dioxide retention, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.",
            "opt_7": "Correct. The client has symptomatic hyponatremia (sodium 122 mEq/L with altered mental status). This is likely due to decreased free water clearance. Cautious administration of hypertonic saline is indicated to slowly correct the sodium level and improve neurological function. This is prioritized over isotonic fluids.",
            "opt_8": "Correct. The client is minimally responsive and critically ill, requiring strict monitoring of intake and output to guide fluid resuscitation and assess renal function. An indwelling urinary catheter is necessary for accurate hourly urine output measurement."
