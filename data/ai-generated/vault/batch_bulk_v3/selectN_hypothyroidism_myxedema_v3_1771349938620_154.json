IV levothyroxine (synthetic T4) provides immediate thyroid hormone replacement, which is crucial for reversing the hypometabolic state.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** IV levothyroxine is preferred over oral administration in myxedema coma due to unreliable gastrointestinal absorption in critically ill patients.

However, rapid rewarming with a forced-air warmer can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a further drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse. This is because the body's compensatory mechanisms are already severely compromised.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Passive rewarming with blankets is the preferred method for treating hypothermia in myxedema coma.

Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect life-threatening arrhythmias (e.g., bradycardia, atrial fibrillation), and continuous respiratory monitoring (including pulse oximetry and capnography) is needed to assess and manage hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Be prepared to provide ventilatory support (e.g., bag-valve-mask ventilation, intubation) if the client's respiratory status deteriorates.",

The stress of severe hypothyroidism can overwhelm the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol. Administering thyroid hormone alone can increase cortisol demand and worsen an underlying adrenal insufficiency, leading to shock.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** It is standard practice to administer IV glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone) empirically until adrenal insufficiency can be ruled out.
