This clinical picture is a classic presentation of optic neuritis, a common and hallmark sign of an MS relapse caused by inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve."

Although it is a slight increase from the previous week's measurement of 78/min, this minor change is not clinically significant and can be attributed to factors like anxiety or pain rather than being a direct indicator of an MS relapse."
