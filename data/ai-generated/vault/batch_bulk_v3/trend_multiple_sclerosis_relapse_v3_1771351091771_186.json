        "rationale": "Correct. A decrease in motor strength in the right upper extremity (4/5 to 3/5) signifies a new or worsening motor deficit, consistent with an MS relapse. This indicates active demyelination in the corticospinal tracts affecting motor control.",

Initiate referrals for speech therapy (dysphagia), occupational therapy (motor weakness), and physical therapy (ataxia). Implement fall precautions. Consider MRI to assess for new lesions."
