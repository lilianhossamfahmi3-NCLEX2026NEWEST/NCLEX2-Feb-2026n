    "scenario": "A school nurse is assessing an 8-year-old boy with a known history of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The teacher brought him to the office after lunch, stating, \"He seems very tired and has a cough that won't stop.\" The nurse observes the child is lethargic, has a weak, wet-sounding cough, and a respiratory rate of 28/min. The child's Individualized Healthcare Plan (IHP) is on file. This scenario is based on unique seed ID BATCH-300-184-1771350983829.",

Obtaining a pulse oximetry reading provides an immediate, objective measure of gas exchange to determine the severity of the situation."

Auscultating lung sounds helps the nurse identify adventitious sounds like crackles or rhonchi, indicating retained secretions or atelectasis, which is common in DMD due to ineffective cough. This information is vital for the next steps and for reporting."

Accurate charting of assessments, interventions, and notifications must occur after the child's immediate needs are addressed."
