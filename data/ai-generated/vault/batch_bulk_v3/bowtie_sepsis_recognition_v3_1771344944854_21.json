    "questionText": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 58-year-old male who presents with increasing fatigue, chills, and confusion. He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 5 days ago. The nurse has reviewed the client's history and current assessment findings. Based on the data provided, what condition is the client most likely experiencing? What actions should the nurse take? What parameters should the nurse monitor to evaluate the client's response?",
