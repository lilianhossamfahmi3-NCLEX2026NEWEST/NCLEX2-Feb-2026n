The client's blood pressure is 188/110 mmHg, heart rate is 124/min, and they report a pounding headache and palpitations. The healthcare provider has prescribed an IV infusion of an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Which nursing interventions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The correct interventions focus on stabilizing the client's dangerously high blood pressure and heart rate while preventing triggers that could cause a further surge in catecholamine release from the tumor. This involves creating a calm, low-stimulation environment, continuously monitoring for cardiac dysrhythmias caused by excess catecholamines, and frequently assessing hemodynamic response to the initiated alpha-blocker therapy to allow for safe titration and prevention of both hypertensive crisis and iatrogenic hypotension.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect interventions are actions that are either contraindicated or unsafe in a client with a pheochromocytoma. Palpating the abdomen can cause a massive release of catecholamines, leading to a fatal hypertensive crisis. Physical exertion from ambulation can also trigger catecholamine release. Administering a beta-blocker before adequate alpha-blockade is established is extremely dangerous, as it can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing a paradoxical and severe increase in blood pressure.",
