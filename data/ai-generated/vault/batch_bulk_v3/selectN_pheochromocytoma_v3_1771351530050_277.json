The client's blood pressure is 188/110 mmHg, heart rate is 124/min, and they report a pounding headache and palpitations. The healthcare provider has prescribed an IV infusion of an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Which nursing interventions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The correct interventions focus on mitigating the effects of excessive catecholamine release characteristic of pheochromocytoma. Maintaining a low-stimulation environment (A) minimizes sympathetic nervous system activation, preventing further catecholamine surges. Continuous cardiac monitoring (D) is crucial for detecting and managing potential arrhythmias caused by catecholamine-induced myocardial irritability. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate (E) during alpha-blocker titration allows for precise medication adjustments, preventing both hypertensive crises and iatrogenic hypotension.",
    "incorrect": "Palpating the abdomen (B) is contraindicated as it can trigger a massive catecholamine release from the tumor, leading to a hypertensive crisis. Ambulation (C) can also stimulate catecholamine release due to increased sympathetic activity. Administering a beta-blocker before establishing adequate alpha-blockade (F) is dangerous because it can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, resulting in a paradoxical and severe hypertensive crisis.",
