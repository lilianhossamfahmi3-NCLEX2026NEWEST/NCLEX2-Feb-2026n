    "question": "The nurse is caring for a 48-year-old client in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) 30 minutes after a knee arthroscopy. Ten minutes after starting an infusion of intravenous cefazolin, the client reports feeling \"extremely itchy\" and that their \"throat feels tight.\" The nurse's assessment reveals urticaria across the client's chest and neck, diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, and a blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg with a heart rate of 128/min. The nurse has activated the Rapid Response Team. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

        "title": "Rationale for Anaphylactic Shock Interventions",
        "stemRationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a rapidly progressing anaphylactic reaction, a life-threatening medical emergency. The trigger is the recent administration of cefazolin, a common allergen. The subjective data ('extremely itchy,' 'throat feels tight') and objective data (urticaria, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia) indicate a systemic mast cell degranulation causing massive histamine release. This has resulted in airway compromise (laryngeal edema and bronchoconstriction) and distributive shock (vasodilation). The nurse must perform critical interventions in a specific priority order to prevent cardiovascular collapse and respiratory arrest.",

                "position": 1,
                "rationale": "The absolute first priority is to stop the infusion of cefazolin. This action removes the triggering antigen, which is essential to prevent the anaphylactic cascade from worsening. Continuing the infusion would intensify the life-threatening reaction."

                "position": 2,
                "rationale": "The immediate administration of epinephrine is the cornerstone and first-line pharmacological treatment for anaphylaxis. It must be given without delay. Its alpha-adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, which counteracts vasodilation and raises blood pressure. Its beta-adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, which opens the airways, and it also reduces further mediator release from mast cells."

                "position": 3,
                "rationale": "After administering epinephrine to begin reversing the underlying pathophysiology, the nurse must address the client's respiratory distress and hypoxia. The client's wheezing and sensation of a tight throat indicate significant airway compromise. Applying high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask maximizes oxygen delivery to vital organs while the epinephrine takes effect."

                "position": 4,
                "rationale": "The client's blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg indicates distributive shock due to profound vasodilation and capillary leakage. After addressing the immediate airway and breathing threats, rapid administration of an isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, is critical to expand intravascular volume, support blood pressure, and improve tissue perfusion."

                "rationale": "Administering diphenhydramine, an H1-receptor antagonist (antihistamine), is a second-line, adjunctive therapy. It is effective for treating cutaneous manifestations like urticaria and pruritus but does not reverse life-threatening hypotension or bronchoconstriction. Therefore, it is administered only after life-saving interventions (epinephrine, oxygen, IV fluids) have been initiated."
