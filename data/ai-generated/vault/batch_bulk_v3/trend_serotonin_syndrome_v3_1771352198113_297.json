States, 'I've been so depressed lately.' Home medications include escitalopram 10 mg daily.\n\n**Day 2, 0800:** Client reports 3/10 pain in leg. Redness has not extended. Client is restless, frequently changing position in bed. States, 'I just can't get comfortable.' Denies pain other than leg. Alert and oriented x4.\n\n**Day 3, 0800:** Client is agitated and confused to time and place. Trying to climb out of bed. Skin is diaphoretic. Muscles in upper and lower extremities feel rigid. When assessing deep tendon reflexes in the ankle, the foot continues to tap rhythmically. Left leg redness and swelling are unchanged."

        "correct": "The nurse should recognize that the client's trended data indicates a progression to serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity. The client is taking three serotonergic agents: escitalopram (SSRI), tramadol (opioid with serotonin reuptake inhibition), and ondansetron (serotonin antagonist, which can paradoxically contribute). The constellation of findings including hyperthermia, autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension), altered mental status (agitation, confusion), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (clonus, rigidity) are classic signs of this syndrome and require immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration, seizures, or death.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options are either expected findings related to the client's diagnosis of cellulitis (WBC count) or indicate an improvement in the initial presenting problem (pain rating). While these are part of the overall clinical picture, they do not represent the acute, life-threatening neurological and autonomic crisis that is developing.",
