        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions follows the principle of least restrictive intervention while prioritizing the immediate safety of all individuals on the unit. The first step must be to ensure environmental safety by removing the other client, who is the target of the paranoid delusion. Next, the nurse should attempt verbal de-escalation. If this is successful, reducing environmental stimuli is the next logical step. If non-pharmacological methods are ineffective, offering PRN medication is appropriate. The final step, used only when the situation cannot be controlled and poses an imminent danger, is to activate a specialized team for a potential show of force or physical restraint.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering fails to prioritize immediate safety or prematurely escalates to more restrictive interventions. For example, offering medication before attempting verbal de-escalation is overly restrictive. Approaching the agitated client before removing the other client leaves the other individual in a potentially dangerous situation. Activating an emergency team as a first step is inappropriate unless there is an immediate physical assault occurring.",
