    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the nursing process. The client's statement indicates an imminent suicide risk, making continuous one-to-one observation the priority. A comprehensive suicide risk assessment follows to gather detailed information about the plan, intent, and means. Establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial for ongoing care and trust. Antidepressant medication is important but not the immediate priority. Group sessions are beneficial but require the client to be stable and safe. \n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** MDD can significantly impair judgment and impulse control, increasing suicide risk. A client with a specific plan and means is at high risk for immediate self-harm. Continuous observation provides a safe environment and prevents the client from acting on suicidal impulses. A thorough assessment helps determine the severity of the risk and guides the development of a safety plan.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize safety when a client expresses suicidal ideation, especially with a plan and means. Never leave the client unattended.",
    "incorrect": "Any other order would compromise the client's safety. Delaying continuous observation or a suicide risk assessment could allow the client to act on their suicidal plan. Prioritizing medication or group therapy before ensuring safety and establishing rapport is inappropriate and potentially dangerous.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Administering antidepressants before ensuring safety can be risky. Some antidepressants can initially increase energy levels before improving mood, potentially providing the client with the energy to act on suicidal thoughts. Group therapy requires a level of stability and engagement that a client in acute crisis may not possess.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Therapeutic interventions are most effective when layered, with safety as the foundation. Building rapport is essential, but it cannot replace immediate safety measures when a client is actively suicidal.",
