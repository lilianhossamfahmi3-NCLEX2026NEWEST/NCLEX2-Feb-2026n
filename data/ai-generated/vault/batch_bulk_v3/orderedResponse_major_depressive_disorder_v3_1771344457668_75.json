The highest priority is ensuring the client's immediate physical safety due to an active suicidal plan and means. Therefore, initiating one-to-one observation is the first action. This is followed by a comprehensive assessment to gather specific details about the risk. Next, establishing a therapeutic relationship is crucial for all subsequent interventions. Pharmacological treatment is then initiated. Finally, once the client is safe and more stable, they can be encouraged to participate in therapeutic group activities.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order would be incorrect because it would fail to prioritize the client's immediate safety. For example, administering medication or encouraging group therapy before initiating suicide precautions would leave the client at imminent risk for self-harm. Performing a detailed assessment before ensuring a staff member is physically present with the client also poses an unnecessary risk. Therapeutic interventions must be layered, with safety as the foundational first step.",
