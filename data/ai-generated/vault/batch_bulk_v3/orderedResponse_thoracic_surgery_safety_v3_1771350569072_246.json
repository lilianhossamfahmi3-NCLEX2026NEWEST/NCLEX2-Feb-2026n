    "stem": "A nurse is preparing to ambulate a 68-year-old client for the first time on post-operative day 1 following a right upper lobectomy. The client has a chest tube connected to wall suction at -20 cm H2O. The provider has ordered to ambulate the client in the hallway with the chest tube to water seal. The client rates their incisional pain as 7/10.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence follows the nursing process and prioritizes safety. First, the nurse must assess the client's baseline respiratory status to ensure they are stable enough for activity. Second, managing the client's significant pain is crucial, as uncontrolled pain will inhibit deep breathing and movement; IV analgesics should be given time to take effect. Third, teaching the client how to splint the incision prepares them to manage pain during movement. Fourth, the chest tube must be safely disconnected from suction according to the order just before mobilization. Finally, assessing for orthostatic hypotension while dangling is the last safety check before the client stands to ambulate.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering of these steps can compromise client safety. For example, ambulating a client with unmanaged pain can cause shallow breathing and guarding, leading to atelectasis. Disconnecting the chest tube too early, before the client is ready to move, leaves the system on water seal for an unnecessarily long period. Failing to assess for orthostatic hypotension before standing could result in a syncopal episode and fall. Assessment must always precede intervention to ensure the client is stable for the planned activity.",
