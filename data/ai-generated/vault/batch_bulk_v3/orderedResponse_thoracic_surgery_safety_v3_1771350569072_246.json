  "stem": "A nurse is preparing to ambulate a 68-year-old client for the first time on post-operative day 1 following a right upper lobectomy. The client has a chest tube connected to wall suction at -20 cm H2O. The provider has ordered to ambulate the client in the hallway with the chest tube to water seal. The client rates their incisional pain as 7/10.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety and effective pain management before ambulation. Assessing baseline respiratory status ensures the client is stable enough for activity. Addressing pain allows for deeper breathing and participation. Splinting the incision provides support and reduces pain during movement. Disconnecting the chest tube from suction, as ordered, prepares for ambulation while maintaining a water seal. Finally, assessing for orthostatic hypotension minimizes the risk of falls.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect ordering can compromise client safety. Ambulation with unmanaged pain can lead to shallow breathing and atelectasis. Premature chest tube disconnection increases the time on water seal unnecessarily. Neglecting orthostatic hypotension assessment increases fall risk. Assessment must precede intervention to ensure client stability.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "optionId": "opt_02",
        "content": "This is the first action. A baseline respiratory assessment (rate, effort, SpO2) is crucial to determine the client's physiological stability before ambulation. Post-lobectomy, clients are at risk for respiratory complications. This assessment provides a reference point to compare against post-activity findings. A normal SpO2 is generally 95-100% on room air, and respiratory rate should be between 12-20 breaths per minute.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationaleDeep": "Post-lobectomy, the remaining lung tissue must compensate for the removed lobe. Assessing respiratory status identifies pre-existing compromise (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia) that could be exacerbated by ambulation. Hypoxemia or increased respiratory effort indicates the client may not tolerate the increased oxygen demand of activity."
      },
      {
        "step": 2,
        "optionId": "opt_04",
        "content": "This is the second action. A pain level of 7/10 is significant and will hinder deep breathing and participation in ambulation. Administering IV opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) 20-30 minutes prior allows the medication to reach peak effect, maximizing comfort and cooperation. Reassess pain level after administration.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationaleDeep": "Uncontrolled pain post-operatively leads to splinting, which restricts chest wall expansion and reduces tidal volume. This increases the risk of atelectasis and pneumonia. IV opioids bind to opioid receptors in the CNS, reducing the perception of pain. Timing is crucial to ensure peak analgesic effect during ambulation."

      {
        "step": 3,
        "optionId": "opt_05",
        "content": "This is the third action. After addressing pain pharmacologically, non-pharmacological support is essential. Instructing the client on splinting the incision with a pillow provides support to the surgical site, reducing pain and preventing suture line stress during coughing and movement.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationaleDeep": "Splinting provides counter-pressure to the incision during movement and coughing, minimizing pain and preventing dehiscence. The pillow acts as a physical barrier, reducing strain on the surgical site. This technique empowers the client to actively manage their pain."
      },
      {
        "step": 4,
        "optionId": "opt_03",
        "content": "This is the fourth action. Disconnecting the chest tube from suction, as per the provider's order, should occur immediately before mobilizing the client. Ensuring the air vent is open is a critical safety step to prevent pressure buildup (tension pneumothorax) while the system is on water seal.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationaleDeep": "When connected to suction, the chest tube facilitates drainage of air and fluid from the pleural space. When disconnected and on water seal, the system allows for one-way drainage but prevents air from re-entering the pleural space. Leaving the air vent closed can create a closed system, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure and potentially a tension pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax can cause mediastinal shift, compromising cardiac output and leading to respiratory distress."

      {
        "step": 5,
        "optionId": "opt_01",
        "content": "This is the final preparatory action. Post-surgery, the client is at high risk for orthostatic hypotension due to bed rest, medications, and fluid shifts. Dangling the legs at the bedside allows for gradual acclimatization to an upright position and serves as a final safety check for dizziness or a significant blood pressure drop before the client bears full weight. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationaleDeep": "Prolonged bed rest leads to decreased venous return and reduced baroreceptor sensitivity. Dangling allows blood to pool in the lower extremities, stimulating baroreceptors and promoting vasoconstriction. A significant drop in blood pressure (e.g., >20 mmHg systolic or >10 mmHg diastolic) or an increase in heart rate (>20 bpm) indicates orthostatic hypotension and the need to postpone ambulation."
