The motor weakness is clearly ascending, moving from the lower extremities (2/5 to 0/5) to the upper extremities (4/5 to 2/5), and DTRs have become absent. Most critically, the respiratory parameters show a significant decline. The increasing respiratory rate (18 to 28), decreasing SpO2 (98% to 93%), and sharply worsening Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF from -55 to -25 cm H2O) are hallmark signs of weakening diaphragmatic and intercostal muscles, indicating impending respiratory failure requiring urgent intervention, such as intubation.",

There are no specific signs of pneumonia (e.g., fever, productive cough, abnormal lung sounds are not noted), and the respiratory decline is better explained by the neuromuscular weakness evidenced by the NIF. While autonomic dysfunction is present (labile BP and tachycardia), the client is currently hypotensive, not in a hypertensive crisis, and the primary life-threatening issue is respiratory, not cardiovascular.",
