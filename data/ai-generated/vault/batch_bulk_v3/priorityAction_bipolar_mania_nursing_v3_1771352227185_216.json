The client has not slept in 48 hours, is exhibiting pressured speech, and has been giving away personal belongings. During shift change, the nurse observes the client in the dayroom pacing rapidly, shouting at a news report on the television, and accusing another client of 'stealing his thoughts.' The client's movements are becoming more expansive and agitated.",
