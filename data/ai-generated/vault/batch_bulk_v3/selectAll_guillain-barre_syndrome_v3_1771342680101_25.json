    "correct": "The priority nursing actions for a client with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) focus on preventing life-threatening complications. Ascending paralysis can impair respiratory muscles, leading to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Autonomic dysfunction can cause cardiovascular instability, including dysrhythmias and blood pressure fluctuations. Immobility increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Continuous cardiac monitoring detects and allows for prompt intervention for dysrhythmias. Serial vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) measurements assess respiratory muscle strength and impending respiratory failure, guiding the need for intubation. SCDs prevent DVT formation due to immobility.",
    "incorrect": "Corticosteroids like prednisone are ineffective in treating GBS and may worsen outcomes. A swallow evaluation is crucial before oral intake due to the risk of dysphagia from cranial nerve involvement. Constant high-Fowler's position increases pressure injury risk; frequent repositioning is essential. A high-protein, high-calorie diet is important, but only after confirming safe swallowing.",

        "content": "Incorrect. Corticosteroids are not beneficial in GBS and may prolong recovery. GBS is characterized by autoimmune-mediated demyelination of peripheral nerves. Corticosteroids do not address the underlying demyelination process and have not demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. Plasmapheresis and IVIG are the standard treatments.",

This can lead to cardiovascular instability, including dysrhythmias (e.g., sinus tachycardia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation), hypertension, and postural hypotension. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection and management of these potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.",

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. Ascending paralysis in GBS can affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to respiratory failure. Vital capacity (VC) measures the maximum amount of air a client can exhale after a maximal inhalation, reflecting lung volume and respiratory muscle strength. Negative inspiratory force (NIF) measures the strength of the inspiratory muscles. Serial measurements of VC and NIF are crucial for detecting early signs of respiratory muscle weakness and impending respiratory failure, guiding the need for mechanical ventilation.",

This can manifest as sinus tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension, postural hypotension, or other dysrhythmias, necessitating continuous cardiac monitoring for early detection and intervention.",
    "C": "Correct: The most critical complication of GBS is respiratory failure from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Serial measurements of vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) are the most reliable indicators of respiratory muscle strength and impending respiratory arrest, allowing for timely elective intubation.",
    "F": "Correct: The paralysis associated with GBS causes profound immobility, placing the client at a very high risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). Mechanical prophylaxis with SCDs is a standard and essential intervention.",
    "A": "Incorrect: Unlike other autoimmune neurologic disorders, corticosteroids such as prednisone have not been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of GBS and may prolong recovery time. The standard treatments are plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",
    "D": "Incorrect: While an upright position can facilitate breathing, maintaining a static high-Fowler's position increases the risk of skin breakdown, particularly on the sacrum and heels, in an immobile client. The client requires a frequent turning and repositioning schedule to maintain skin integrity.",
    "E": "Incorrect: While nutritional support is important, the priority is to assess for dysphagia before initiating any oral intake. GBS can affect cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, impairing the ability to swallow. Encouraging a diet without a formal swallow screen places the client at high risk for aspiration."
