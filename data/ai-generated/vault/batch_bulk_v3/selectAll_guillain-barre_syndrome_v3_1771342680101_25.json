The client reports ascending paralysis that has now reached the upper legs and has tingling in the hands. Which nursing actions should the nurse implement in the plan of care?

These include respiratory failure due to ascending paralysis affecting the diaphragm, autonomic dysfunction causing cardiovascular instability (e.g., dysrhythmias, severe hypertension/hypotension), and complications of immobility such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Therefore, performing serial respiratory muscle strength assessments (vital capacity), placing the client on a cardiac monitor, and applying SCDs for DVT prophylaxis are all critical interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Corticosteroids like prednisone are not effective in treating GBS and may worsen outcomes. While nutrition is important, a swallow evaluation must be performed before encouraging oral intake due to the risk of dysphagia from cranial nerve involvement. Constant positioning in high-Fowler's is inappropriate as it increases the risk for pressure injuries; frequent repositioning is necessary.",
