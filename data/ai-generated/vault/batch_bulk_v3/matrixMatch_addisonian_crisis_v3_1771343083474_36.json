    "correct": "An Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening endocrine emergency caused by acute adrenal insufficiency, leading to profound hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The adrenal glands fail to produce sufficient cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol is crucial for glucose regulation, blood pressure maintenance, and immune function. Aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium balance. In Addisonian crisis, the lack of cortisol leads to hypoglycemia due to impaired gluconeogenesis and increased insulin sensitivity. The deficiency of aldosterone causes sodium and water loss, leading to hypovolemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia results from decreased potassium excretion. The priority is to rapidly reverse shock, correct electrolyte imbalances, and replace corticosteroids. This requires administering IV hydrocortisone (to replace cortisol) and large volumes of IV fluids (0.9% sodium chloride and D5NS) to address hypovolemia and hypoglycemia. Hyperkalemia is treated with insulin and dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly. Seizure precautions are implemented due to the risk of seizures from hyponatremia.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect interventions either worsen the client's condition or are inappropriate for the pathophysiology of an Addisonian crisis. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, would exacerbate life-threatening hyperkalemia. Fluid restriction is contraindicated as the client is severely dehydrated and hypovolemic; it is a treatment for SIADH, not adrenal insufficiency.",

In Addison's disease, the lack of cortisol and aldosterone leads to decreased vascular tone and sodium/water loss. 0.9% sodium chloride restores intravascular volume, increasing blood pressure. Hydrocortisone replaces the deficient cortisol, which has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects, further supporting blood pressure and reducing inflammation. The rapid administration of fluids and hydrocortisone is critical to prevent irreversible organ damage and death.",

In Addison's disease, aldosterone deficiency impairs potassium excretion by the kidneys. Insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into cells by stimulating the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, temporarily lowering serum potassium levels. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells as well. This combination rapidly shifts potassium intracellularly, stabilizing the cardiac membrane and preventing life-threatening arrhythmias.",

In Addison's disease, aldosterone deficiency leads to sodium loss in the urine. While fluid resuscitation with 0.9% NS will help correct the sodium level, the immediate priority from a safety standpoint is to protect the client from injury by implementing seizure precautions (padded side rails, suction equipment at bedside) and closely monitoring neurological status for changes (level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor strength).
