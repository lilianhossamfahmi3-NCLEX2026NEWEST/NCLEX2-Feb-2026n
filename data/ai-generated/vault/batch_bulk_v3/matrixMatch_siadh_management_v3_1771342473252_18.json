        "correct": "The client presents with classic signs of SIADH secondary to small cell lung cancer, including significant symptomatic hyponatremia (118 mEq/L), low serum osmolality, and inappropriately concentrated urine. The primary goals of management are to restrict free water intake, correct the hyponatremia at a safe rate, and prevent complications such as seizures. Therefore, indicated actions include fluid restriction, initiating seizure precautions due to the low sodium level, and providing comfort measures like oral care that are essential for a client on fluid restriction. Interventions that would worsen the condition, such as administering hypotonic fluids or desmopressin (an ADH analog), are strictly contraindicated. Actions that are not directly related to correcting the core problem and carry potential risks, like inserting an indwelling catheter or ordering a low-sodium diet, are non-essential.",
