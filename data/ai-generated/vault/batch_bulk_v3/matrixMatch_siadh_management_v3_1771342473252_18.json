    "correct": "The client exhibits classic signs and symptoms of SIADH, a condition often associated with small cell lung cancer due to ectopic ADH production. The pathophysiology involves excessive ADH release, leading to increased water reabsorption in the kidneys, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia (serum sodium 118 mEq/L), decreased serum osmolality (260 mOsm/kg), and concentrated urine (specific gravity 1.035, osmolality 850 mOsm/kg). The priority nursing interventions focus on managing fluid balance and preventing neurological complications. Therefore, implementing a fluid restriction (800 mL/24 hours) is crucial to reduce water retention and allow serum sodium to normalize gradually. Seizure precautions are indicated due to the high risk of seizures associated with severe hyponatremia. Frequent oral care and ice chips provide comfort and manage thirst associated with fluid restriction. Desmopressin, a synthetic ADH analog, is contraindicated as it would exacerbate the condition. Hypotonic IV solutions would further dilute serum sodium and are also contraindicated. A low-sodium diet is non-essential as the hyponatremia is dilutional, not due to sodium deficiency. An indwelling urinary catheter is non-essential unless the client is unable to void spontaneously or accurately measure urine output by other means, as it increases the risk of infection.",

        "label": "Implement a fluid restriction of 800 mL/24 hours",
        "content": "Indicated. Fluid restriction is the cornerstone of SIADH management. By limiting fluid intake, the kidneys can excrete excess water, gradually increasing serum sodium levels. The goal is to achieve a slow and controlled correction of hyponatremia to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of dehydration, such as dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor, despite the overall fluid overload state.",
