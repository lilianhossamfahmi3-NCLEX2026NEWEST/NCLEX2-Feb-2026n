Profound hypothyroidism leads to a decreased metabolic rate, reducing heat production and impairing thermoregulation.

This worsening bradycardia and hypotension are cardinal signs of myxedema coma. The deficiency of thyroid hormone impairs cardiac contractility and reduces cardiac output. Additionally, decreased peripheral vascular resistance contributes to hypotension. The heart's sensitivity to catecholamines is also reduced, further exacerbating the bradycardia and hypotension.

This progressive decline in consciousness is a critical indicator of myxedema coma. Decreased thyroid hormone levels lead to reduced cerebral metabolism, causing confusion, lethargy, and eventually coma. CO2 retention and cerebral hypoxia further contribute to the altered mental status. The brain's energy production is severely compromised, leading to neuronal dysfunction and impaired cognitive function.

Pneumonia increases the metabolic demands on the body, which can exacerbate underlying hypothyroidism and trigger myxedema coma in susceptible individuals.

While these values indicate the severity of the hypothyroidism, the question asks for indicators of *developing* myxedema coma, which are reflected in the changes observed over time.
