Vital signs are: blood pressure 224/130 mmHg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and SpO2 96% on room air. The provider diagnoses a hypertensive emergency. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "In a hypertensive emergency, the priority is to implement interventions that safely lower the blood pressure while preventing further end-organ damage. This involves administering a titratable IV antihypertensive (labetalol), initiating continuous cardiac monitoring due to the risk of ischemia and dysrhythmias, performing frequent neurological assessments to monitor for worsening encephalopathy or stroke, and inserting a urinary catheter to closely track renal perfusion and function.",
        "incorrect": "Actions that are contraindicated or unsafe must be avoided. Rapidly lowering the blood pressure by 50% can cause cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. Encouraging ambulation is unsafe for a client with confusion, blurred vision, and hemodynamic instability. The focus is on controlled, gradual reduction of blood pressure and meticulous monitoring of organ systems.",
