  "question": "A 68-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department with a severe headache, blurred vision, and confusion. Vital signs are: blood pressure 224/130 mmHg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and SpO2 96% on room air. The provider diagnoses a hypertensive emergency. Using SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) format, which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "In a hypertensive emergency, rapid and significant elevation in blood pressure can cause acute end-organ damage. The priority is to safely and gradually lower the blood pressure while meticulously monitoring for complications. \n\n*   **Administer IV labetalol:** Labetalol, a beta-blocker, is a first-line agent for hypertensive emergencies due to its rapid onset and titratability. It reduces blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance without significantly affecting heart rate. The goal is controlled reduction, not a precipitous drop.\n*   **Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring:** The extreme hypertension and associated tachycardia increase myocardial oxygen demand, raising the risk of ischemia, infarction, and dysrhythmias. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and treatment of these life-threatening complications.\n*   **Perform hourly neurological assessments:** Hypertensive encephalopathy, characterized by cerebral edema and altered brain function, is a major concern. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary response, motor strength) are crucial to detect worsening neurological status, such as evolving stroke or seizures.\n*   **Insert an indwelling urinary catheter:** The kidneys are highly susceptible to damage from uncontrolled hypertension. An indwelling urinary catheter allows for precise, hourly measurement of urine output, providing real-time data on renal perfusion and function. Decreased urine output can indicate acute kidney injury.\n\n**SBAR Rationale:**\n*   **Situation (0800):** 68-year-old male admitted with severe headache, blurred vision, and confusion. BP 224/130 mmHg, HR 110, RR 22, SpO2 96% on room air. Diagnosed with hypertensive emergency.\n*   **Background:** History of hypertension, non-compliant with medications. No known allergies. Current medications unknown.\n*   **Assessment:** Altered mental status, elevated BP, tachycardia. Possible hypertensive encephalopathy and risk for cardiac ischemia/dysrhythmias and acute kidney injury.\n*   **Recommendation:** Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring, administer IV labetalol per protocol, insert indwelling urinary catheter for hourly output, and perform neurological assessments every hour. Monitor for signs of end-organ damage.",
    "incorrect": "Rapidly lowering the blood pressure too much or failing to monitor for end-organ damage can lead to severe complications.\n\n*   **Lowering MAP by 50%:** A precipitous drop in blood pressure can cause cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to ischemic stroke or other organ damage. The goal is a gradual reduction of no more than 20-25% in the first hour.\n*   **Encouraging ambulation:** The client's confusion, blurred vision, and hemodynamic instability create a high fall risk. Strict bed rest is indicated until the blood pressure is stabilized and neurological symptoms improve.",
