            "C1": "Correct. The client's clinical triad of altered mental status (confusion, agitation), autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular abnormalities (clonus, hyperreflexia) after taking multiple serotonergic agents (escitalopram, sumatriptan, and a likely herbal supplement like St. John's Wort) is classic for Serotonin Syndrome.",
            "C2": "Incorrect. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is associated with antipsychotic medications, which are not in the client's history. NMS typically presents with 'lead-pipe' rigidity and hyporeflexia, contrasting with the hyperreflexia and clonus seen in this client.",
            "C3": "Incorrect. Malignant Hyperthermia is a rare, life-threatening reaction to volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine, none of which are relevant to this client's presentation in the emergency department.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. While Thyroid Storm can present with hyperthermia, tachycardia, and altered mental status, it would not typically cause the prominent neuromuscular findings like clonus and hyperreflexia. The client's medication history strongly points to a neurotransmitter-related syndrome."
        },
        "blank_1": {
            "A1": "Correct. The client's temperature of 39.5° C (103.1° F) indicates severe hyperthermia, which is a life-threatening complication of Serotonin Syndrome. Immediate initiation of external cooling measures (e.g., cooling blankets, ice packs to axillae/groin) is a priority to prevent organ damage and cardiovascular collapse.",
            "A2": "Incorrect. Administering another dose of a serotonergic agent like escitalopram would worsen the syndrome by further increasing synaptic serotonin levels. All serotonergic agents must be discontinued immediately.",
            "A3": "Incorrect. Dantrolene is used for Malignant Hyperthermia. While it can be considered in severe cases of Serotonin Syndrome if other measures fail, it is not a first-line intervention. The priority is supportive care and benzodiazepines."
        },
        "blank_2": {
            "B1": "Correct. Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam) are a cornerstone of treatment for Serotonin Syndrome. They are used to control agitation, reduce neuromuscular excitability (clonus, rigidity), and prevent seizures, which also helps to lower the body temperature by decreasing muscle activity.",
            "B2": "Incorrect. Antipyretics like acetaminophen or NSAIDs are ineffective for the hyperthermia seen in Serotonin Syndrome because the increased temperature is caused by excessive muscle activity, not by an alteration in the hypothalamic temperature set-point.",
            "B3": "Incorrect. The client has an altered mental status (confusion, agitation), which places them at high risk for aspiration. Oral fluids are contraindicated until their mental status improves and a swallow evaluation can be performed. Intravenous fluids would be the appropriate route for hydration."
        },
        "blank_4": {
            "D1": "Correct. Hyperthermia is a key indicator of severity and a major cause of mortality in Serotonin Syndrome. Continuously monitoring the core body temperature is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of cooling interventions and titrate treatment.",
            "D2": "Incorrect. While the client is likely dehydrated due to diaphoresis and hyperthermia, and monitoring fluid status is important, urine specific gravity is not the most critical, immediate parameter to monitor. Stabilizing core temperature and neuromuscular activity takes precedence.",
            "D3": "Incorrect. Serum creatinine is monitored to assess for acute kidney injury, which can be a complication of rhabdomyolysis in severe cases. However, it is a lagging indicator of organ damage, not a direct measure of the client's immediate response to life-saving interventions like cooling."
        },
        "blank_5": {
            "E1": "Correct. Neuromuscular excitability, specifically the presence and severity of clonus, hyperreflexia, and rigidity, is a hallmark of Serotonin Syndrome. Monitoring for the reduction of these signs is a direct way to assess the client's response to treatment (e.g., benzodiazepines) and the resolution of the syndrome.",
            "E2": "Incorrect. Electrolyte imbalances can occur, but monitoring serum potassium is not a primary parameter for tracking the progression or resolution of Serotonin Syndrome itself. It would be part of a broader metabolic panel but not a key focused assessment.",
            "E3": "Incorrect. While stress hyperglycemia can occur, blood glucose is not a specific or sensitive parameter for monitoring the severity or improvement of Serotonin Syndrome. The primary pathology is neurologic and autonomic, not metabolic."
