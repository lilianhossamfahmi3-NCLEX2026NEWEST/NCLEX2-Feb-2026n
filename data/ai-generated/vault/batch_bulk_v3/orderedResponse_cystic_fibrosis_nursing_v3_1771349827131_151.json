        "introduction": "The correct sequence of interventions for a client with cystic fibrosis is based on pathophysiological principles to maximize the effectiveness of each treatment. The sequence involves opening the airways, thinning mucus, clearing the mucus, ensuring proper digestion, and finally, documenting the care provided.",

                "optionId": "opt-1",
                "step": 1,
                "explanation": "Administering the inhaled albuterol (a bronchodilator) is the first action. This medication opens the airways (bronchodilation), allowing subsequent inhaled medications to penetrate deeper into the lungs and making airway clearance techniques more effective."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt-4",
                "step": 2,
                "explanation": "Administering the nebulized dornase alfa (a mucolytic) is the second action. This enzyme breaks down the thick, purulent mucus characteristic of CF. It is most effective when administered after the bronchodilator has opened the airways, ensuring maximal deposition and therapeutic effect."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt-2",
                "step": 3,
                "explanation": "Performing chest physiotherapy (CPT) and postural drainage is the third action. This airway clearance technique is performed after the airways are opened and the mucus has been thinned. This sequence maximizes the mobilization and expectoration of secretions from the lungs."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt-3",
                "step": 4,
                "explanation": "Administering pancrelipase is the fourth action. This pancreatic enzyme replacement must be given immediately before or with the first bite of a meal. This timing is critical for the enzymes to mix with food in the duodenum to facilitate the digestion and absorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, preventing malabsorption and steatorrhea."

                "explanation": "Documentation is the final step in the nursing process. After all interventions are completed, the nurse must accurately document the treatments administered, the client's tolerance to the procedures, the amount and characteristics of sputum produced, and the client's respiratory status."
