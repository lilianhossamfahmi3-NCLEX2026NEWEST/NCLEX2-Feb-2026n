      "situation": "16-year-old male with cystic fibrosis admitted for pulmonary exacerbation. Orders include airway clearance and medications before breakfast.",
      "background": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing abnormal mucus production, leading to airway obstruction, chronic infection, and pancreatic insufficiency. Pulmonary exacerbations involve increased inflammation and mucus plugging.",
      "assessment": "Client requires airway clearance and medication administration.",
      "recommendation": "Prioritize interventions to open airways, thin secretions, clear mucus, and support digestion. Document client tolerance and outcomes."
    },
    "introduction": "The correct sequence prioritizes bronchodilation, mucolytic administration, airway clearance, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and documentation. This approach maximizes therapeutic effectiveness and supports optimal respiratory and digestive function in the client with CF.",

      {
        "optionId": "opt-1",
        "step": 1,
        "explanation": "Administer inhaled albuterol via nebulizer. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) that causes bronchodilation by relaxing smooth muscles in the airways. This allows for improved airflow and enhanced delivery of subsequent medications. *Clinical Pearl: Assess heart rate before and after albuterol administration, as tachycardia is a common side effect.*"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt-4",
        "step": 2,
        "explanation": "Administer nebulized dornase alfa. Dornase alfa is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) that breaks down extracellular DNA in the thick mucus secretions of CF patients. This reduces mucus viscosity, facilitating airway clearance. *Clinical Pearl: Administer dornase alfa after a bronchodilator to optimize its distribution throughout the lungs.*"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt-2",
        "step": 3,
        "explanation": "Perform chest physiotherapy (CPT) and postural drainage. CPT involves percussion, vibration, and postural drainage to loosen and mobilize secretions from different lung segments. Postural drainage uses gravity to assist in draining secretions. *Clinical Pearl: Schedule CPT at least one hour before or two hours after meals to prevent aspiration.*"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt-3",
        "step": 4,
        "explanation": "Administer pancrelipase capsules with the first bite of the meal. Pancrelipase is a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) containing lipase, protease, and amylase. CF patients often have pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Administering pancrelipase with meals aids in digestion and nutrient absorption. *Clinical Pearl: Adjust pancrelipase dosage based on stool output and fat content to optimize absorption and minimize steatorrhea.*"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt-5",
        "step": 5,
        "explanation": "Document the interventions and the client's tolerance. Accurate documentation is essential for monitoring the client's response to treatment, identifying potential adverse effects, and adjusting the plan of care as needed. Include the time of interventions, medications administered, sputum characteristics, respiratory status, and any adverse reactions. *Clinical Pearl: Document the effectiveness of CPT by noting the amount and consistency of expectorated secretions.*"
