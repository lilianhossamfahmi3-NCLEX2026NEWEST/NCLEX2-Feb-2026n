  "stem": "A nurse in an outpatient mental health clinic is reviewing the electronic health record of a 48-year-old client with bipolar I disorder prior to their scheduled appointment. The client has been taking lithium carbonate for five years. The nurse notes the client was recently prescribed hydrochlorothiazide by their primary care provider for hypertension. Which of the following client statements, documented during a phone call yesterday, should the nurse recognize as the most concerning cue?",

    "rationale": "This question requires the nurse to recognize the most critical cue indicating potential lithium toxicity. The correct response demonstrates an understanding of the interaction between thiazide diuretics and lithium, as well as the hallmark signs of developing toxicity.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Lithium is a mood-stabilizing drug with a narrow therapeutic index. Thiazide diuretics, like hydrochlorothiazide, increase sodium excretion. The kidneys compensate by increasing lithium reabsorption, leading to elevated lithium levels in the blood. This can quickly lead to lithium toxicity.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Concurrent use of lithium and thiazide diuretics requires close monitoring of lithium levels and renal function. Educate clients about the signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity and the importance of maintaining adequate hydration.\n\n**SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation):**\n*   **Situation (0900):** Client taking lithium and recently started on hydrochlorothiazide is reporting muscle twitching, shakiness, and confusion.\n*   **Background:** 48-year-old with bipolar I disorder, on lithium for 5 years. New prescription for hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension.\n*   **Assessment:** These symptoms are indicative of moderate lithium toxicity (likely serum levels 1.5-2.5 mEq/L) due to the interaction with hydrochlorothiazide.\n*   **Recommendation:** STAT lithium level, hold the next dose of lithium, notify the provider immediately, assess renal function (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes), and prepare for potential interventions based on lithium level (e.g., IV fluids, gastric lavage, dialysis).",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Mild peripheral edema can be a side effect of lithium or may be related to the client's hypertension. While it requires assessment, it is not a specific or acute sign of lithium toxicity, which primarily manifests with neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms. Edema can be managed with elevation and compression, but it's not the priority in this scenario. The neurological symptoms are more concerning for immediate safety."

        "id": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyuria (increased urination) are common and expected side effects of long-term lithium therapy, often associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. While these warrant monitoring and further investigation to rule out diabetes insipidus, they are not typically signs of acute toxicity unless they represent a sudden, drastic change. These symptoms are more chronic and less immediately life-threatening than neurological symptoms."

      {
        "id": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Correct. Muscle twitching (fasciculations), increased shakiness (coarse tremors), and confusion are classic signs of moderate lithium toxicity (serum levels typically 1.5-2.5 mEq/L). The client’s new prescription for hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, significantly increases the risk for toxicity because it promotes sodium excretion, which in turn leads to increased renal reabsorption of lithium. This combination of signs is the most concerning and requires immediate intervention to prevent progression to severe toxicity. These neurological symptoms indicate a potentially dangerous lithium level requiring immediate action."

      {
        "id": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Weight gain is a common long-term side effect associated with lithium therapy. A gain of 7 pounds over a year is a significant but not an acute finding related to toxicity. It is a topic for health teaching and management, including dietary modifications and exercise, but does not represent an urgent risk like the neurological symptoms of toxicity. While weight gain should be addressed, it is not the priority in this situation."
