The client has been taking lithium carbonate for five years. The nurse notes the client was recently prescribed hydrochlorothiazide by their primary care provider for hypertension. Which of the following client statements, documented during a phone call yesterday, should the nurse recognize as the most concerning cue?",

                "rationale": "Incorrect. Mild peripheral edema can be a side effect of lithium or may be related to the client's hypertension.

                "rationale": "Incorrect. Polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyuria (increased urination) are common and expected side effects of long-term lithium therapy, often associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. While these warrant monitoring, they are not typically signs of acute toxicity unless they represent a sudden, drastic change."

                "rationale": "Correct. Muscle twitching (fasciculations), increased shakiness (coarse tremors), and confusion are classic signs of moderate lithium toxicity (serum levels typically 1.5-2.5 mEq/L). The client’s new prescription for hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, significantly increases the risk for toxicity because it promotes sodium excretion, which in turn leads to increased renal reabsorption of lithium. This combination of signs is the most concerning and requires immediate intervention to prevent progression to severe toxicity."

                "id": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Weight gain is a common long-term side effect associated with lithium therapy. A gain of 7 pounds over a year is a significant but not an acute finding related to toxicity. It is a topic for health teaching and management but does not represent an urgent risk like the neurological symptoms of toxicity."
