The combination of a rapid, shallow respiratory rate (28/min), low oxygen saturation (90%), inability to manage secretions (gurgling), weak and ineffective cough, and speaking in short phrases points to impending respiratory failure. The priority action according to airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles is to secure the airway. Therefore, preparing for immediate endotracheal intubation is the most critical, life-saving intervention.",

Administering oral medication is contraindicated due to severe dysphagia and aspiration risk, and its onset would be too slow. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is a helpful supportive measure but does not resolve the underlying muscle failure. Requesting a neurology consult is necessary but is secondary to stabilizing the client's airway and breathing.",
