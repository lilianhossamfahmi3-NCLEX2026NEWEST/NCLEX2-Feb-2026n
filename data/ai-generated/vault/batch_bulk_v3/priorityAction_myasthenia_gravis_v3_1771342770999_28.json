Prepare for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Differentiate from cholinergic crisis (too much medication) using edrophonium (Tensilon) test, although this test is rarely used now due to risk of bradycardia and asystole. Monitor ABGs closely. Consider plasmapheresis or IVIG after stabilization. Keep atropine at bedside."
