The nurse is reviewing the client's electronic health record to prepare for the morning assessment.\n\n**0700 Nurse's Note**\nClient is alert and oriented x3, reports incisional pain as 4/10. Abdominal dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Bowel sounds are hypoactive in all four quadrants. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Client had one episode of hypotension (88/52 mmHg) overnight requiring a 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride bolus. Urine output has been 15-20 mL/hr for the past 4 hours. The client is receiving IV gentamicin for gram-negative coverage. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place and functioning.\n\n**0600 Laboratory Results**\n*   WBC: 11.2 x 10^9/L\n*   Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL\n*   Platelets: 210,000/mm3\n*   Sodium: 138 mEq/L\n*   Potassium: 5.6 mEq/L\n*   BUN: 45 mg/dL\n*   Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL (baseline was 0.9 mg/dL)\n*   Glucose: 125 mg/dL"
