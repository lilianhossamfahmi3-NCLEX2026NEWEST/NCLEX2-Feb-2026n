She reports feeling 'puffy and weak' for several months, with recent onset of a cough.\n**B:** History of severe rheumatoid arthritis treated with high-dose prednisone (40 mg daily) for the past two years. Client lives alone in a rural area with limited public transportation, making frequent follow-up appointments challenging. She has a known allergy to penicillin.\n**A:** Vital signs on admission stable. Physical exam notable for central obesity, moon facies, and 3+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. Skin assessment reveals thin, fragile skin with multiple ecchymoses and prominent purple striae on the abdomen. Client appears fatigued but is alert and oriented x4. Blood glucose on admission is elevated at 188 mg/dL.\n**R:** Continue home dose of prednisone as ordered. Initiate comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC with differential. Begin frequent vital sign monitoring, daily weights, and strict intake/output. Consult nutrition for a low-sodium, carbohydrate-controlled diet. \n\n### Progress Note\n**11/08/2026 13:00**\n**S:** Client used call light to report a worsening productive cough and states she is now 'seeing halos around the lights.'\n**B:** Client's temperature has trended upward since admission. The most recent lab results show hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The client has been on high-dose corticosteroids, a significant risk factor for both immunosuppression and glaucoma.\n**A:** Temperature is now 101.5°F (38.6°C). SpO₂ is 94% on room air. Coarse crackles auscultated in the right lower lobe. Client appears anxious. Visual complaint is a new, acute finding.\n**R:** Notify provider of fever, productive cough, and visual disturbances immediately. Recommend obtaining a stat chest x-ray and blood cultures. Prepare to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. Request an urgent ophthalmology consultation for suspected acute glaucoma. Continue to monitor vital signs every hour."
