Expected findings include hypokalemia, dependent edema, and purple striae, which result directly from excess cortisol. Findings requiring immediate action are those that signal severe complications, such as immunosuppression leading to infection (fever, cough) or steroid-induced glaucoma (halos around lights). Unexpected findings, like hyponatremia, are not typical of Cushing's syndrome (which usually causes sodium retention) and suggest a different or co-existing pathology that warrants further investigation.",
