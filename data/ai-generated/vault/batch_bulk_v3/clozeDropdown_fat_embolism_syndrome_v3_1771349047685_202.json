    "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic triad of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES): respiratory distress, neurological changes (restlessness), and a petechial rash. The priority nursing action is to address the life-threatening hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) by applying high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask to deliver the highest possible FiO2, following the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). This improves oxygen delivery to vital organs. A STAT chest x-ray is the initial diagnostic tool to visualize the diffuse bilateral infiltrates ('snowstorm effect') characteristic of FES-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These infiltrates represent pulmonary edema and inflammation caused by fat emboli. Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, may be prescribed to decrease the inflammatory lung injury caused by the breakdown of fat globules into toxic free fatty acids. These fatty acids damage the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of neurological status is critical because cerebral emboli can cause a rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, or focal deficits due to ischemia and inflammation in the brain.",
    "incorrect": "Failing to prioritize oxygenation can lead to rapid respiratory failure and irreversible organ damage. While notifying the provider is essential (after stabilizing the patient), it should be done after initiating a life-saving intervention like oxygen administration. Choosing diagnostic tests for thromboembolism (V/Q scan, CT angiogram, d-dimer) is incorrect because FES is a distinct pathophysiological process involving fat emboli, not blood clots. Administering morphine is inappropriate as it is a respiratory depressant and will worsen the client's hypoxemia. Placing the client in a supine position will further compromise respiratory function. Focusing on other parameters like urinary output or pain, while part of a general assessment, misses the specific and most severe risks associated with FES, which are profound hypoxemia and cerebral dysfunction. These parameters do not directly reflect the immediate threat to the patient's life.",
