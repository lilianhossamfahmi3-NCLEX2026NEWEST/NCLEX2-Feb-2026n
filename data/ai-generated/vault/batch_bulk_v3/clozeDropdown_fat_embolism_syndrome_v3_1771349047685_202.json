    "question": "A 22-year-old client is admitted to the orthopedic unit following surgical repair of a comminuted femur fracture. Forty-eight hours post-operatively, the nurse assesses the client and notes a temperature of 100.9°F (38.3°C), a heart rate of 124/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and an SpO2 of 88% on room air. The client is restless and states, 'I feel like I can't catch my breath.' The nurse also observes a fine, non-blanching petechial rash on the client's chest and axillae. Based on the suspected diagnosis of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES), the nurse should first {{blank1}}. The nurse anticipates an order for a STAT {{blank2}} to assess for pulmonary changes. The provider is also likely to prescribe {{blank3}} to reduce the inflammatory response. The most critical parameter for the nurse to monitor closely is the client's {{blank4}}.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic triad of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES): respiratory distress, neurological changes (restlessness), and a petechial rash. The priority nursing action is to address the life-threatening hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) by applying high-flow oxygen, following the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). A STAT chest x-ray is the initial diagnostic tool to visualize the diffuse bilateral infiltrates ('snowstorm effect') characteristic of FES-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids may be prescribed to decrease the inflammatory lung injury caused by the breakdown of fat globules. Continuous monitoring of neurological status is critical because cerebral emboli can cause a rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, or focal deficits.",
        "incorrect": "Failing to prioritize oxygenation can lead to rapid respiratory failure. While notifying the provider is essential, it should be done after initiating a life-saving intervention. Choosing diagnostic tests for thromboembolism (V/Q scan, CT angiogram, d-dimer) is incorrect because FES is a distinct pathophysiological process. Administering heparin is inappropriate as it treats blood clots, not fat globules. Focusing on other parameters like urinary output or pain, while part of a general assessment, misses the specific and most severe risks associated with FES, which are profound hypoxemia and cerebral dysfunction.",
