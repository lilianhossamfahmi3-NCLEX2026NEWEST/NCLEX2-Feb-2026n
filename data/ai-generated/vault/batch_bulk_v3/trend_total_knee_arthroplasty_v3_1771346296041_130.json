    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE), a life-threatening complication of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The trend data shows the development of a DVT in the right calf (increasing soreness, swelling, tenderness) which has now likely embolized to the lungs. The acute onset of chest pain, tachypnea (28/min), tachycardia (118/min), and hypoxemia (SpO2 90%) are hallmark indicators of a PE. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* A PE occurs when a blood clot, often originating from a DVT, travels through the venous system to the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow to the lungs. This obstruction leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, causing right ventricular strain and potentially right heart failure. The impaired gas exchange results in hypoxemia, stimulating chemoreceptors and leading to tachypnea. The body attempts to compensate by increasing heart rate to maintain cardiac output. Chest pain arises from pulmonary infarction or pleural irritation due to the embolus. \n\nThese findings represent a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention (e.g., oxygen administration, notifying the rapid response team and provider) to prevent further cardiopulmonary collapse.",
    "incorrect": "While some findings are abnormal, they are either expected post-operatively or are not as immediately life-threatening as the signs of pulmonary embolism. A low-grade temperature is a common inflammatory response after major surgery. A knee pain rating of 5/10 is expected on post-op day 2. A stable blood pressure, while reassuring, does not rule out a PE. The calf swelling and tenderness are signs of the underlying DVT, which is the source of the problem; however, according to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework of prioritization, the signs of cardiopulmonary compromise from the PE are the most immediate threat to life and must be addressed first.",
