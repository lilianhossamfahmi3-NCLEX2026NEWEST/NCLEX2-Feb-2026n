    "question": "A 78-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, a cough producing pink-tinged sputum, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The nurse has placed the client on a cardiac monitor and established intravenous access. Based on the client's presentation, which prescribed action should the nurse implement **first**?",
    "options": [
        "Insert an indwelling urinary catheter.",
        "Administer IV furosemide 40 mg.",
        "Apply a 100% non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min.",
        "Administer IV metoprolol 5 mg."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While administering a loop diuretic like furosemide is a crucial intervention to reduce fluid volume and pulmonary congestion in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), it is not the immediate priority. The patient's most urgent problem is hypoxemia (SpO2 88%), which directly threatens life. Furosemide's diuretic effect takes time to begin, whereas supplemental oxygen will immediately improve oxygenation."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is important for accurately monitoring urine output, which is essential for titrating diuretic therapy. However, this is a secondary action performed after initiating life-saving interventions. It does not address the client's immediate and life-threatening impaired gas exchange."

                "optionIndex": 2,
                "isCorrect": true,
                "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing acute hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) secondary to pulmonary edema. According to the principles of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), addressing impaired gas exchange is the highest priority. Applying a high-flow non-rebreather mask will immediately increase the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), improve arterial oxygen saturation, reduce the work of breathing, and help prevent further clinical deterioration."

            {
                "optionIndex": 3,
                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker like metoprolol is contraindicated during an acute heart failure decompensation episode. Beta-blockers have negative inotropic effects (decrease contractility), which can worsen cardiac output and exacerbate the signs and symptoms of acute failure, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock."
