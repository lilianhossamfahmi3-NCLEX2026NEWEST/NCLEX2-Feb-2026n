  "question": "A 78-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department at 14:00 with severe dyspnea, a cough producing pink-tinged sputum, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The nurse has placed the client on a cardiac monitor and established intravenous access. Based on the client's presentation, which prescribed action should the nurse implement **first**?",
  "options": [
    "Insert an indwelling urinary catheter.",
    "Administer IV furosemide 40 mg.",
    "Apply a 100% non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min.",
    "Administer IV metoprolol 5 mg."

        "optionIndex": 0,
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While inserting a urinary catheter is useful for monitoring urine output and assessing the effectiveness of diuretic therapy, it is not the priority in this situation. The client's immediate need is to improve oxygenation. Addressing hypoxemia takes precedence over monitoring fluid balance.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Urinary catheterization is important for fluid management but is a secondary intervention in acute respiratory distress."
      },
      {
        "optionIndex": 1,
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that will help reduce fluid overload and pulmonary congestion. However, its effects are not immediate. The client's oxygen saturation of 88% indicates severe hypoxemia, which requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential organ damage. Addressing the impaired gas exchange is the priority.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Diuretics are essential for managing fluid overload in heart failure, but oxygenation is the immediate priority in acute respiratory distress."
      },
      {
        "optionIndex": 2,
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. The client's presentation indicates acute pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure exacerbation, leading to severe hypoxemia (SpO2 88%). The priority is to improve oxygenation immediately. Applying a 100% non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min delivers a high concentration of oxygen, increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and improving arterial oxygen saturation. This addresses the immediate life-threatening problem of impaired gas exchange. The underlying pathophysiology involves fluid accumulation in the alveoli, hindering gas exchange. High-flow oxygen helps to maximize oxygen delivery to the blood.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In acute pulmonary edema, high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is the first-line intervention to address hypoxemia and prevent respiratory failure."
      },
      {
        "optionIndex": 3,
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that decreases heart rate and contractility. In acute decompensated heart failure, administering a beta-blocker can worsen the client's condition by further reducing cardiac output and potentially leading to cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers are typically held during acute decompensation and reintroduced cautiously once the client is stabilized. The negative inotropic effects of metoprolol can exacerbate the heart's inability to pump effectively.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure due to their negative inotropic effects, which can worsen cardiac output."
