      "opt_01": "A temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F) indicates a fever, which is a component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). While fever is a common sign of infection, it is not specific to sepsis and can be present in other conditions, such as simple postoperative infections. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The client's fever, in isolation, does not confirm organ dysfunction.",
      "opt_02": "Mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness is an expected finding in the immediate postoperative period following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. While significant or worsening abdominal pain could indicate a complication (e.g., bile leak, abscess), mild tenderness alone is not the most concerning indicator of sepsis. Sepsis involves a systemic response and organ dysfunction, which is not directly indicated by mild abdominal tenderness.",
      "opt_03": "Correct. New-onset confusion or altered mental status is a critical early sign of sepsis-induced encephalopathy, reflecting cerebral hypoperfusion and/or the effects of systemic inflammation on the brain. Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Altered mental status is a key component of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, indicating a higher risk of mortality. The pathophysiology involves inflammatory mediators crossing the blood-brain barrier, disrupting neuronal function, and impairing cerebral oxygen delivery.",
      "opt_04": "A WBC count of 16,500/mm³ indicates leukocytosis, which is a common response to infection and surgical stress. While leukocytosis confirms an inflammatory process, it is a non-specific marker and does not, by itself, indicate the presence of organ dysfunction, which is the defining characteristic of sepsis. Other factors, such as the client's confusion, are more indicative of systemic compromise and organ dysfunction."
