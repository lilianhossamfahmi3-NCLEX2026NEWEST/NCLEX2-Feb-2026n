It is a significant cue, but less specific for organ dysfunction compared to a change in mental status.",
            "opt_02": "Mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness is an expected finding three days after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. While worsening or severe pain could indicate a complication like a bile leak or abscess, mild tenderness by itself is not the most concerning sign of systemic decompensation (sepsis).",
            "opt_03": "Correct. An acute change in mental status, such as new-onset confusion, is a critical and often early sign of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction (encephalopathy). It reflects inadequate cerebral perfusion and/or the effects of systemic inflammation on the brain. This finding is a key component of the qSOFA (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score and indicates a progression from a localized infection to life-threatening sepsis.",
            "opt_04": "A WBC count of 16,500/mm³ indicates leukocytosis, which is an expected response to infection and surgical stress. While it confirms an inflammatory process is occurring, it is a non-specific marker and does not, by itself, indicate the presence of organ dysfunction, which is the defining characteristic of sepsis."
