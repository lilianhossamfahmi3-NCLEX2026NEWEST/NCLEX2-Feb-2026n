He is reporting a significant increase in pain and appears more distressed than he was two hours ago. B: The client was admitted 12 hours ago from the ED with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed by elevated lipase and CT scan. He has a history of gallstones and reports social alcohol use. He lives alone in a rural area, which may present a barrier to follow-up care. He is currently NPO with IV Lactated Ringer's infusing. His last dose of PRN morphine was four hours ago. A: Vital signs are trending towards instability: HR 118, BP 102/68, RR 24, SpO2 89% on room air. He is guarding his abdomen, which is distended. Pain is now 9/10, described as constant and boring. Auscultation reveals new-onset fine crackles in bilateral lower lobes. A positive Chvostek's sign was just elicited. R: I will apply supplemental oxygen, reposition the client, and administer the available PRN morphine now. I am requesting you come to the bedside to assess for potential ARDS and hemorrhagic complications."
