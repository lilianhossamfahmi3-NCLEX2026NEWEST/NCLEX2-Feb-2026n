        "correct": "The nurse must be able to differentiate between expected findings, acute complications requiring immediate independent nursing action, and severe complications requiring collaboration and anticipation of provider orders. Severe pain, signs of hypocalcemia (Chvostek's), and respiratory compromise (crackles, hypoxia) warrant immediate nursing interventions to ensure client safety and comfort. Signs of retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Cullen's sign) indicate a life-threatening complication where the nurse must prepare for and anticipate provider-driven interventions like massive fluid or blood product resuscitation. Expected laboratory findings, while confirming the diagnosis, are monitored over time to assess the client's response to treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections fail to prioritize nursing actions based on the urgency and nature of the clinical finding. For example, selecting 'Monitor/Assess Trend' for respiratory distress or severe pain would be unsafe and neglect the nurse's duty to act. Selecting 'Immediate Intervention' for an expected lab value is incorrect as no new, specific action is triggered by the number alone. Selecting 'Anticipate Provider Order' for severe pain is also suboptimal, as PRN analgesics are typically already ordered, making the immediate action the administration of the existing order.",
