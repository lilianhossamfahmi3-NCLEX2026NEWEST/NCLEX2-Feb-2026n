This is a surgical emergency. The priority actions are to immediately notify the provider and relieve the external pressure by preparing to bivalve (cut) the cast. Continuous, focused monitoring of the limb's neurovascular status and objective measurement of the intracompartmental pressure are critical to assess progression and guide treatment.",
