    "correct": "The plan of care for a client with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) requires a multi-system approach to address the progressive nature of the disease. The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to muscle fiber destruction affecting skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. The correct interventions are targeted at specific complications: corticosteroids to slow muscle degeneration, respiratory exercises to maintain lung function as the diaphragm weakens, routine ECGs to detect early cardiomyopathy, and passive stretching to prevent contractures resulting from muscle imbalance and immobility.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect pairings fail to address the specific pathophysiological problem. For instance, obtaining a serum creatine kinase (CK) level is a diagnostic or monitoring tool for muscle damage, not a therapeutic intervention to achieve a care goal. High-impact aerobic exercise is contraindicated as it can accelerate muscle damage in clients with DMD. While each correct action is vital, it must be matched to the appropriate goal; for example, passive stretching prevents contractures but does not slow the primary progression of muscle weakness.",

        "label": "Slow progression of muscle weakness",
        "content": "The most appropriate action is to administer corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone or deflazacort, are the cornerstone of pharmacological therapy for DMD. They work by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system, which slows down muscle cell damage. Dystrophin, a protein normally found in muscle cells, is absent in DMD. This absence leads to muscle cell instability and increased susceptibility to damage from inflammation and immune responses. Corticosteroids help to stabilize muscle cell membranes and reduce the rate of muscle degeneration, thereby prolonging ambulation and preserving respiratory function.",

        "label": "Maintain respiratory function",
        "content": "The most appropriate action is to teach deep breathing and coughing techniques. Progressive weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles leads to a weak, ineffective cough and restrictive lung disease. The diaphragm, the primary muscle for breathing, weakens due to the lack of dystrophin, reducing the ability to take deep breaths and effectively clear secretions. This can lead to atelectasis (lung collapse) and pneumonia. Proactive interventions like incentive spirometry, assisted coughing ('huffing'), and deep breathing exercises are essential to maintain lung capacity, clear secretions, and prevent these complications. These techniques help to strengthen respiratory muscles and improve the efficiency of gas exchange.",

        "label": "Monitor for cardiac complications",
        "content": "The most appropriate action is to schedule a routine electrocardiogram (ECG). Cardiomyopathy is a universal complication and a leading cause of mortality in DMD due to dystrophin deficiency in cardiac muscle. Dystrophin is also present in cardiac muscle, and its absence leads to progressive weakening and enlargement of the heart (dilated cardiomyopathy). This can result in heart failure and arrhythmias. Regular cardiac surveillance with ECG and echocardiography, starting at diagnosis, is critical for the early detection of conduction abnormalities and ventricular dysfunction, allowing for timely initiation of cardioprotective medications like ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to slow the progression of cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function.",

      {
        "label": "Prevent joint contractures",
        "content": "The most appropriate action is to perform passive stretching exercises. As muscles weaken and shorten, clients with DMD are at high risk for developing joint contractures, particularly at the ankles, knees, and hips. Muscle weakness leads to an imbalance in the forces acting on joints, causing some muscles to become tight and shortened while others become weak and overstretched. This imbalance results in joint stiffness and limited range of motion. A daily regimen of passive stretching and range-of-motion exercises is a critical intervention to maintain joint mobility, prevent deformities, and preserve function. Passive stretching helps to lengthen shortened muscles and maintain flexibility, preventing the development of contractures.",

  "clinicalPearl": "Early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial in managing Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Regular monitoring for respiratory and cardiac complications, along with proactive interventions like corticosteroids and physical therapy, can significantly improve the client's quality of life and prolong survival.

    "situation": "At 1400, a 10-year-old male client with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is being admitted for routine monitoring and management of his condition. He has a history of progressive muscle weakness, respiratory difficulties, and cardiac complications.",
    "background": "The client was diagnosed with DMD at age 5. DMD is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness due to the absence of dystrophin protein. This affects skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, leading to various complications. He currently takes prednisone 10mg daily and uses a cough assist device PRN.",
    "assessment": "Current assessment findings include: Muscle weakness in extremities, decreased respiratory effort with SpO2 94% on room air, heart rate 90 bpm and regular, and limited range of motion in ankles and knees. The client is at risk for respiratory infections, cardiac decompensation, and worsening contractures.",
    "recommendation": "The plan of care should include: Continue corticosteroid administration as prescribed, implement respiratory exercises (deep breathing and coughing techniques) every 2 hours, schedule a routine ECG, perform passive stretching exercises twice daily, and monitor respiratory status and cardiac function closely. Educate the parents on the importance of adherence to the plan and early recognition of complications. Consult with physical therapy and cardiology as needed."
