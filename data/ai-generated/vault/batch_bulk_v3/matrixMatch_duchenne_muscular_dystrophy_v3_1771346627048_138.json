The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to muscle fiber destruction affecting skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. The correct interventions are targeted at specific complications: corticosteroids to slow muscle degeneration, respiratory exercises to maintain lung function as the diaphragm weakens, routine ECGs to detect early cardiomyopathy, and passive stretching to prevent contractures resulting from muscle imbalance and immobility.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect pairings fail to address the specific pathophysiological problem. For instance, obtaining a serum creatine kinase (CK) level is a diagnostic or monitoring tool for muscle damage, not a therapeutic intervention to achieve a care goal. High-impact aerobic exercise is contraindicated as it can accelerate muscle damage in clients with DMD. While each correct action is vital, it must be matched to the appropriate goal; for example, passive stretching prevents contractures but does not slow the primary progression of muscle weakness.",
