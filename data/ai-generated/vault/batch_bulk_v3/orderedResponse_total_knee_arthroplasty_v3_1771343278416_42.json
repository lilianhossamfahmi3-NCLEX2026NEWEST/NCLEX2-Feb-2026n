The client is alert and oriented, reports incisional pain as 6/10, and has orders to ambulate with a walker, weight-bearing as tolerated. The nurse has six actions to perform. In which order should the nurse perform these actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The correct sequence for ambulating a client for the first time after a total knee arthroplasty prioritizes pain management, patient safety, and gradual progression of activity. First, the nurse must administer an analgesic to manage pain, as a pain level of 6/10 will inhibit participation. This medication needs time to take effect (typically 30-60 minutes). Second, the knee immobilizer is applied while the client is still in bed to protect the new joint during transfers. Third, the client is assisted to a sitting position to allow for acclimatization to an upright posture. Fourth, while sitting, ankle pumps are encouraged to promote venous return and reduce the risk of orthostasis. Fifth, a crucial safety check for orthostatic hypotension is performed before the client attempts to stand. Finally, with the client confirmed to be hemodynamically stable, the nurse provides instructions and assists with the actual ambulation using the walker.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence compromises patient safety or the effectiveness of the intervention. Failing to medicate for pain first will likely lead to an unsuccessful ambulation attempt. Standing the client before assessing for orthostatic hypotension creates a significant fall risk. Not applying the knee immobilizer before movement could result in instability or injury to the surgical site. Each step has a specific place in the sequence to ensure a safe and therapeutic outcome.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the first step because the client's reported pain of 6/10 is significant enough to interfere with their ability to participate in physical activity. Providing analgesia 30-60 minutes before ambulation ensures the medication reaches peak effect, maximizing pain control and patient cooperation."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This action should be performed after pain medication has been given but before the client moves. The immobilizer provides crucial support and stability to the operative knee, preventing excessive flexion and protecting the surgical repair during the transfer from lying to sitting and then to standing."

                "explanation": "After ensuring the knee is protected, the next step is to have the client sit on the side of the bed. This allows the client to adjust to an upright position gradually, which can help minimize dizziness and orthostatic changes before they attempt to stand."

                "explanation": "While the client is sitting and acclimating to the upright position, performing ankle pumps is an important prophylactic measure. This action activates the calf muscle pump, which promotes venous return, decreases venous stasis, and helps reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism (VTE)."

                "explanation": "This is a critical safety check that must be performed after the client has been sitting for a few minutes but *before* they stand. The combination of postoperative fluid shifts, anesthesia effects, and analgesic side effects places the client at high risk for orthostatic hypotension. Standing a client without this assessment could lead to syncope and a fall, potentially damaging the new joint."

Once the client is confirmed to be pain-controlled, stable in a sitting position, and not orthostatic, the nurse provides clear instructions and assists the client to stand and begin walking with the assistive device, ensuring they understand the weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT) status."
