  "prompt": "The nurse is preparing to ambulate a 68-year-old client for the first time on postoperative day 1 following a right total knee arthroplasty. The client is alert and oriented, reports incisional pain as 6/10, and has orders to ambulate with a walker, weight-bearing as tolerated. The nurse has six actions to perform. In which order should the nurse perform these actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes pain management, joint protection, and safety. Administering the analgesic first (0900) allows time for it to take effect, reducing pain and improving participation. Applying the knee immobilizer protects the surgical site during movement. Assisting the client to sit allows for gradual adaptation to an upright position, minimizing dizziness. Ankle pumps promote venous return, reducing the risk of orthostatic hypotension and VTE. Assessing for orthostatic hypotension is crucial before standing to prevent falls. Finally, instructing on walker use and weight-bearing ensures safe ambulation.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences compromise safety and effectiveness. Ambulation without pain control is unlikely to succeed. Neglecting the knee immobilizer risks joint instability. Skipping orthostatic hypotension assessment increases fall risk. Each step is crucial for a safe and therapeutic outcome.",

      {
        "label": "1",
        "content": "Administer the prescribed PRN oral analgesic.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Pain control is paramount. A pain level of 6/10 will significantly impede ambulation. Administering the analgesic (e.g., opioid or non-opioid) 30-60 minutes prior (0900) allows for peak effect. Uncontrolled pain increases muscle tension, limits range of motion, and elevates blood pressure and heart rate, hindering rehabilitation. Clinical Pearl: Document the pain level and medication administered. Reassess pain 30-60 minutes post-administration."

        "label": "2",
        "content": "Apply the knee immobilizer securely over the operative leg.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "The knee immobilizer provides external support and limits excessive flexion/extension, protecting the healing joint. It reduces stress on the surgical site and minimizes the risk of disruption of the repair. Apply it while the client is supine or in a low Fowler's position (0930). Clinical Pearl: Ensure proper fit; it should be snug but not constricting, allowing for circulation. Assess skin integrity under the immobilizer regularly."

        "content": "Assist the client to a sitting position on the edge of the bed.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "This allows the client to gradually adjust to an upright position, minimizing the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Postoperative clients are at risk due to fluid shifts, anesthesia, and analgesics. Sitting at the edge of the bed (0945) allows blood to redistribute and the body to compensate. Clinical Pearl: Observe for dizziness or lightheadedness. If present, assist the client back to a supine position and reassess blood pressure."

      {
        "label": "4",
        "content": "Encourage the client to perform ankle pumps while sitting.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Ankle pumps activate the calf muscle pump, promoting venous return and reducing venous stasis. This helps prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and orthostatic hypotension. The calf muscles compress veins, propelling blood back to the heart. Encourage 10-20 repetitions (0950). Clinical Pearl: Teach the client to dorsiflex and plantarflex the foot, emphasizing full range of motion."

      {
        "label": "5",
        "content": "Assess the client for orthostatic hypotension.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Orthostatic hypotension is a significant risk postoperatively. Assess blood pressure and heart rate in the supine and sitting positions. A drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥10 mmHg within 1-3 minutes of sitting indicates orthostatic hypotension (0955). This is due to decreased venous return and impaired baroreceptor response. Clinical Pearl: If orthostatic hypotension is present, assist the client back to a supine position and notify the healthcare provider."

      {
        "label": "6",
        "content": "Instruct the client on using the walker and correct weight-bearing technique.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Once the client is stable and pain is managed, instruct on walker use and weight-bearing status (1000). Weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT) means the client can put as much weight on the leg as they can tolerate without excessive pain. Proper walker technique ensures stability and reduces the risk of falls. Clinical Pearl: Demonstrate proper walker use: advance the walker, then step with the affected leg, followed by the unaffected leg. Ensure the client understands their weight-bearing limitations."
