        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation, including hypotension (BP 84/50 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 132 bpm), and altered mental status (confusion, restlessness), are classic signs of hypovolemic shock secondary to an active gastrointestinal bleed. The immediate priority is to restore intravascular volume to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion. Initiating a rapid infusion of an isotonic crystalloid solution, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, through a large-bore IV (e.g., 16 or 18 gauge) is the most critical first action to stabilize the client's hemodynamics.",
        "incorrect": "While the other options are appropriate interventions for a client with a GI bleed, they are not the immediate priority. Administering a PPI, preparing for an EGD, and ordering blood products are all necessary but secondary to stabilizing the client's circulation with intravenous fluids. Delaying fluid resuscitation in a client with active shock can lead to irreversible organ damage and death.",
