    "stem": "A 68-year-old client with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation is admitted to the neurological intensive care unit. The client presented to the emergency department (ED) 3 hours ago with acute-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia. A non-contrast head CT was negative for hemorrhage, and the client received intravenous alteplase (tPA). The infusion was completed 1 hour ago. The client's unique research identifier is BATCH-300-207-1771351841024. The nurse receives the client from the ED with the following vital signs: Blood pressure 178/98 mmHg, heart rate 88 beats/min (irregular), respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96% on 2 L nasal cannula.",

Frequent neurological monitoring (typically every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours) is critical after tPA administration. This allows for the earliest possible detection of neurological deterioration, which could indicate hemorrhagic conversion, cerebral edema, or stroke extension."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. Anticoagulants (like enoxaparin) and antiplatelets are strictly contraindicated for at least 24 hours after receiving alteplase. Administering them significantly increases the risk of intracranial and systemic hemorrhage, the most dangerous complication of thrombolytic therapy."

Until a formal swallow screen or evaluation is performed and the client is deemed safe to swallow, they must be kept NPO to prevent aspiration pneumonia, a common and serious complication."

Invasive procedures, including the placement of indwelling urinary catheters, NG tubes, and central lines, should be avoided for 24 hours after tPA administration whenever possible. These procedures carry a high risk of causing bleeding that can be difficult to control."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Strict blood pressure control is a cornerstone of post-tPA management. The goal is to keep the blood pressure below 180/105 mmHg to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Labetalol is a first-line intravenous agent used for this purpose. The client's current BP of 178/98 mmHg is approaching the treatment threshold."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. The client should be on strict bed rest for the first 24 hours after tPA to maintain hemodynamic stability and minimize the risk of injury or bleeding. While passive range-of-motion may be initiated later to prevent contractures, active exercises are not an immediate priority and could be unsafe."

            "key": "H",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. A sudden, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, or an acute change in level of consciousness are classic signs of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the most life-threatening complication of alteplase. The nurse must vigilantly monitor for and immediately report these symptoms."
