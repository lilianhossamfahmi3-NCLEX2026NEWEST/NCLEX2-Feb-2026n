  "stem": "A 68-year-old client with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation is admitted to the neurological intensive care unit. The client presented to the emergency department (ED) 3 hours ago at 1300 with acute-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia. A non-contrast head CT was negative for hemorrhage, and the client received intravenous alteplase (tPA). The infusion was completed 1 hour ago at 1500. The client's unique research identifier is BATCH-300-207-1771351841024. The nurse receives the client from the ED with the following vital signs: Blood pressure 178/98 mmHg, heart rate 88 beats/min (irregular), respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96% on 2 L nasal cannula.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurological assessments are crucial post-tPA to detect early signs of complications like hemorrhagic conversion or cerebral edema. \n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Alteplase, a thrombolytic, dissolves clots but carries a risk of bleeding. Frequent neuro checks (LOC, motor strength, speech, pupillary response) every 30 minutes for the first 6 hours, then hourly, allow for prompt identification of neurological decline, indicating potential bleeding or worsening ischemia. \n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Subtle changes in neurological status can be the first sign of a serious complication. Document findings meticulously and report any changes immediately.",

      "rationale": "Incorrect. Anticoagulants like enoxaparin are contraindicated for at least 24 hours post-tPA due to the increased risk of bleeding.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Alteplase increases the risk of bleeding. Administering an anticoagulant such as enoxaparin concurrently significantly elevates the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and systemic bleeding. The combined effect of both medications can be life-threatening.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Verify medication orders carefully post-tPA to avoid administering contraindicated drugs. Question any orders for anticoagulants or antiplatelets within the first 24 hours.",
      "SBAR": "S: Client post-tPA with right-sided weakness and aphasia. B: History of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Alteplase completed at 1500. A: Receiving enoxaparin is contraindicated. R: Hold enoxaparin and clarify the order with the provider."

      "rationale": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees promotes venous drainage and reduces intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Elevating the head of the bed facilitates venous return from the brain, reducing cerebral blood volume and ICP. This is particularly important after a stroke to minimize secondary brain injury from edema.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Ensure the client's head and neck are in a neutral position to avoid obstructing venous drainage. Avoid sharp hip flexion, which can increase intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure, indirectly raising ICP.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Maintaining NPO status is essential until a swallow evaluation is performed to prevent aspiration.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Stroke can impair swallowing function (dysphagia). If the client aspirates food or fluids, it can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious complication that can worsen the client's prognosis. NPO status protects the airway until swallowing ability is assessed.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Even if the client appears alert and oriented, a formal swallow evaluation is necessary before oral intake is allowed. Consult speech therapy for assessment and recommendations.",

Invasive procedures should be avoided if possible for 24 hours post-tPA due to the risk of bleeding.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Alteplase increases the risk of bleeding. Invasive procedures, such as urinary catheter insertion, can cause local trauma and bleeding that may be difficult to control in the presence of a thrombolytic agent.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Consider alternative methods for managing urinary retention, such as bladder scans and intermittent catheterization if absolutely necessary. Weigh the risks and benefits carefully before performing any invasive procedure.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Maintaining blood pressure below 180/105 mmHg is crucial to prevent hemorrhagic transformation. Labetalol is appropriate for SBP > 180 mmHg.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Elevated blood pressure post-tPA increases the risk of bleeding into the infarcted area of the brain (hemorrhagic transformation). Labetalol is a beta-blocker that effectively lowers blood pressure without causing excessive hypotension, which could compromise cerebral perfusion.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Monitor blood pressure closely (every 15 minutes initially) and administer antihypertensive medications as prescribed to maintain the target range. Avoid rapid drops in blood pressure.",

      "rationale": "Correct. New onset of severe headache or vomiting can indicate intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a life-threatening complication of alteplase.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a major complication of thrombolytic therapy. Blood leaking into the brain tissue irritates the meninges, causing severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increased ICP from the hematoma can also lead to altered level of consciousness.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Prompt recognition and reporting of these symptoms are crucial for timely intervention. A repeat CT scan is usually indicated to confirm or rule out ICH.",
