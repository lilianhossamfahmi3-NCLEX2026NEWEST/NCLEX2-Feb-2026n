        "overall": "In central Diabetes Insipidus (DI), a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water, leading to massive polyuria. This water loss causes dehydration (fluid volume deficit) and hemoconcentration (concentrated blood), while the urine produced is excessively dilute. The nurse must analyze these cues to understand the underlying pathophysiology.",

                "columnId": "col2",
                "explanation": "A urine specific gravity of 1.002 is very low (normal is 1.010-1.030), indicating that the urine has minimal solutes and is mostly water. This is a hallmark sign of DI, directly reflecting the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine due to ADH deficiency."

                "explanation": "A serum sodium level of 152 mEq/L is elevated (hypernatremia; normal is 135-145 mEq/L). The excessive loss of free water in the urine concentrates the sodium and other solutes in the bloodstream, making the blood more concentrated."

                "explanation": "A heart rate of 118/min is tachycardia. This is a compensatory response to the decreased circulating blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by massive fluid loss through urination. The heart beats faster to maintain cardiac output and tissue perfusion, making it a key indicator of dehydration."

                "explanation": "A serum osmolality of 315 mOsm/kg is high (normal is 275-295 mOsm/kg). This value directly measures the concentration of solutes in the blood. The significant free water loss via the kidneys leads to hemoconcentration, resulting in an elevated serum osmolality."
