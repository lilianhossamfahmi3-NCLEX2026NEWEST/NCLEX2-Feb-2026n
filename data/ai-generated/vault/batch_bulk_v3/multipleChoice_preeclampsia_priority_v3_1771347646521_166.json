The client is exhibiting classic signs of magnesium toxicity, including respiratory depression (respiratory rate < 12 breaths/minute), absent deep tendon reflexes, and a decreased level of consciousness. These signs indicate a life-threatening central nervous system depression. Stopping the infusion is the immediate first step to prevent the client's condition from worsening and to halt further absorption of the drug.",
        "incorrect": "While administering calcium gluconate, notifying the provider, and assessing vital signs are all important interventions, they are not the first priority. The primary rule in managing toxicity is to first stop the source of the offending agent. Administering the antidote (calcium gluconate) is the next step after the infusion is stopped. Notifying the provider should occur after immediate, life-saving measures are taken. Assessing blood pressure does not address the immediate life threat of respiratory arrest from magnesium toxicity.",
