    "correct": "The priority action is to discontinue the magnesium sulfate infusion. The client is exhibiting classic signs of magnesium toxicity: respiratory depression (RR < 12), absent DTRs, and decreased LOC. These indicate life-threatening CNS depression. Stopping the infusion is the immediate first step to prevent worsening and halt further drug absorption.",
    "incorrect": "While administering calcium gluconate, notifying the provider, and assessing vital signs are important, they are not the *first* priority. The primary rule in managing toxicity is to stop the source. Administering the antidote (calcium gluconate) is next, *after* stopping the infusion.
