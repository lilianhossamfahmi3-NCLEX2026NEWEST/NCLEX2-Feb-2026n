The client reports having influenza for the past 3 days with poor oral intake. Assessment findings include: T 38.8°C (101.8°F), HR 128/min, RR 24/min, BP 78/48 mmHg, and SpO2 95% on room air. Laboratory results show sodium 125 mEq/L, potassium 6.8 mEq/L, and glucose 55 mg/dL. The provider diagnoses an Addisonian crisis.\n\nThe nurse should classify each potential action as **Anticipated**, **Contraindicated**, or **Non-Essential** at this time.",

        "correct": "In an Addisonian crisis, the priorities are to reverse profound hypotension, correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and replace corticosteroids. This requires rapid IV administration of glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) and aggressive volume resuscitation with a solution that corrects hyponatremia and hypoglycemia (D5NS). Due to life-threatening hyperkalemia, continuous cardiac monitoring is essential. Actions that would worsen electrolyte imbalances (administering spironolactone or hypotonic fluids) are contraindicated. Slower-acting treatments (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) are not a priority in the acute phase.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrectly classifying these actions can have fatal consequences. Classifying a contraindicated action as anticipated (e.g., giving spironolactone) would worsen the hyperkalemia and increase the risk of cardiac arrest. Classifying an anticipated action as non-essential (e.g., delaying hydrocortisone) would fail to treat the underlying cause of the crisis, leading to continued cardiovascular collapse. Choosing a non-essential action over an anticipated one (e.g., giving sodium polystyrene sulfonate instead of preparing for IV insulin) delays life-saving care.",
