The client reports having influenza for the past 3 days with poor oral intake. Assessment findings include: T 38.8°C (101.8°F), HR 128/min, RR 24/min, BP 78/48 mmHg, and SpO2 95% on room air. Laboratory results show sodium 125 mEq/L, potassium 6.8 mEq/L, and glucose 55 mg/dL. The provider diagnoses an Addisonian crisis.\n\nThe nurse should classify each potential action as **Anticipated**, **Contraindicated**, or **Non-Essential** at this time.",

    "correct": "In Addisonian crisis, the adrenal glands cannot produce sufficient cortisol and aldosterone, leading to life-threatening hypotension, electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), and hypoglycemia. The primary goals are to restore intravascular volume, correct electrolyte and glucose imbalances, and replace deficient hormones.\n\n*   **Hydrocortisone:** Replaces deficient cortisol, addressing the underlying hormonal deficiency. Cortisol normally increases blood glucose levels, regulates sodium and potassium balance, and supports blood pressure.\n*   **D5NS:** Provides rapid volume expansion to combat hypotension, corrects hyponatremia by increasing serum sodium, and treats hypoglycemia by providing glucose.\n*   **Cardiac Monitoring:** Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring allows for early detection and intervention.\n*   **Spironolactone:** A potassium-sparing diuretic, which would worsen hyperkalemia.\n*   **0.45% NaCl:** A hypotonic solution that would exacerbate hyponatremia by further diluting serum sodium.\n*   **Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate:** While it lowers potassium, it acts slowly and is not appropriate for acute hyperkalemia management.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrectly classifying these actions can have fatal consequences. Classifying a contraindicated action as anticipated (e.g., giving spironolactone) would worsen the hyperkalemia and increase the risk of cardiac arrest. Classifying an anticipated action as non-essential (e.g., delaying hydrocortisone) would fail to treat the underlying cause of the crisis, leading to continued cardiovascular collapse. Choosing a non-essential action over an anticipated one (e.g., giving sodium polystyrene sulfonate instead of preparing for IV insulin) delays life-saving care.",
