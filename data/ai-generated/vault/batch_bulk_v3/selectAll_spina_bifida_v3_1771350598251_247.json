    "correct": "The nurse must immediately intervene for findings that indicate acute, life-threatening complications. \n\n**B: Clear fluid leaking from the sac:** This signifies a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, creating a direct pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system. Myelomeningocele involves incomplete closure of the neural tube, leaving the spinal cord and meninges exposed. A CSF leak dramatically increases the risk of meningitis, a severe infection that can cause brain damage, seizures, and death. Immediate intervention is required to prevent infection and further neurological damage. This includes notifying the healthcare provider, maintaining strict sterile technique, and potentially initiating antibiotic therapy.\n\n**D: Temperature of 36.1°C (97.0°F):** This indicates hypothermia. Newborns, especially those with neurological defects like myelomeningocele, have immature thermoregulatory systems and are prone to heat loss. Hypothermia triggers a cascade of physiological responses, including increased metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and glucose utilization. This can lead to hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. Immediate warming interventions are crucial to stabilize the infant's temperature and prevent further complications. This includes using radiant warmers, warm blankets, and monitoring vital signs closely.\n\n**E: High-pitched cry:** This is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Myelomeningocele is often associated with hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of CSF within the ventricles of the brain. The Arnold-Chiari II malformation, commonly seen in myelomeningocele, obstructs CSF flow, leading to ventricular enlargement and increased ICP. A high-pitched cry indicates that the pressure is significantly elevated, potentially causing brain damage. Immediate intervention involves notifying the healthcare provider, assessing fontanels for bulging, and preparing for potential interventions such as a shunt placement to drain excess CSF.",
    "incorrect": "The nurse should document expected findings or normal data but does not need to intervene immediately.\n\n**A: Flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities:** This is an expected clinical manifestation of myelomeningocele due to nerve damage at the lesion site. The severity of paralysis depends on the level of the spinal defect. While ongoing assessment of motor function is important, this finding does not require immediate intervention.\n\n**C: Head circumference of 34 cm:** This is within the normal range for a term newborn (33-35 cm). While monitoring for hydrocephalus is crucial in infants with myelomeningocele, this specific value does not indicate an acute problem. Serial head circumference measurements are essential to track for any rapid increase, which would suggest hydrocephalus.\n\n**F: Voiding small amounts of urine frequently:** This is indicative of overflow incontinence from a neurogenic bladder, an expected complication due to nerve damage affecting bladder control. The infant's bladder does not empty completely, leading to frequent small voids and a risk of urinary stasis and infection. While this requires a long-term management plan, it is not an acute, life-threatening finding requiring immediate intervention.",
