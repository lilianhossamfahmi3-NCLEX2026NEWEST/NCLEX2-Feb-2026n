        "correct": "The nurse must immediately intervene for findings that indicate acute, life-threatening complications. Clear fluid leaking from the sac (B) signifies a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which greatly increases the risk of meningitis. A temperature of 36.1°C (97.0°F) (D) indicates hypothermia, which can rapidly lead to metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress in a newborn. A high-pitched cry (E) is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), suggesting the development of hydrocephalus, a common comorbidity requiring urgent neurosurgical evaluation.",
        "incorrect": "The nurse should document expected findings or normal data but does not need to intervene immediately. Flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities (A) and frequent voiding of small amounts (F) are expected clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele due to nerve damage at the lesion site and a resulting neurogenic bladder. A head circumference of 34 cm (C) is within the normal range for a term newborn and serves as a baseline for future monitoring.",
