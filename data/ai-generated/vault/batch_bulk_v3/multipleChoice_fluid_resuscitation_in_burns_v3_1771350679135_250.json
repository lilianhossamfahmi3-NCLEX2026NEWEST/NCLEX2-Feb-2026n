Intravenous fluid resuscitation with Lactated Ringer's was initiated upon arrival at the burn center. The nurse collects the following assessment data:\n\n- Blood pressure: 92/60 mmHg\n- Heart rate: 130 bpm\n- Urine output: 25 mL/hr\n- Level of consciousness: Restless and anxious\n- Serum lactate: 4.5 mmol/L\n\nWhich action is the priority for the nurse to take?",

        "correct": "The client's assessment findings collectively indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation and progression of burn shock. The primary goal is to restore intravascular volume. The urine output of 25 mL/hr is below the target of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr (40-80 mL/hr for this client). Tachycardia, hypotension, restlessness, and elevated serum lactate are all signs of persistent hypoperfusion. Therefore, the priority intervention is to contact the provider to increase the rate of the crystalloid infusion to improve tissue perfusion and prevent organ failure.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a vasopressor is not the initial priority; the underlying problem is profound hypovolemia, not a primary vasodilation issue. Vasopressors may be used later if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate volume replacement, but administering them to a volume-depleted patient can worsen tissue ischemia. Documenting and waiting is inappropriate as the client is showing clear signs of clinical deterioration requiring immediate action. While a fluid bolus might be necessary, Lactated Ringer's is the preferred fluid for burn resuscitation to buffer acidosis, and the overall rate, not just a single bolus, likely needs adjustment. Requesting 0.9% sodium chloride could contribute to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis when given in large volumes.",
