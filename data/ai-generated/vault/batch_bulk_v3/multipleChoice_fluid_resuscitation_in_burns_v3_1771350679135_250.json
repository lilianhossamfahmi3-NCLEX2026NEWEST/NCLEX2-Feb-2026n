    "correct": "The client's assessment findings (hypotension, tachycardia, low urine output, restlessness, elevated lactate) indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation and the progression of burn shock. Burn shock is a type of hypovolemic shock caused by massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space due to increased capillary permeability and inflammatory responses following a burn injury. The goal is to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. The urine output of 25 mL/hr is significantly below the target of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr (40-80 mL/hr for this client). Tachycardia, hypotension, restlessness, and elevated serum lactate are all signs of persistent hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the priority intervention is to notify the provider and advocate for an increased rate of the crystalloid infusion (Lactated Ringer's) to improve tissue perfusion and prevent organ failure. Increasing the IV fluid rate addresses the underlying hypovolemia and supports adequate renal perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a vasopressor is not the initial priority; the underlying problem is profound hypovolemia, not a primary vasodilation issue. Vasopressors may be used later if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate volume replacement, but administering them to a volume-depleted patient can worsen tissue ischemia by constricting already poorly perfused vessels. Documenting and waiting is inappropriate as the client is showing clear signs of clinical deterioration requiring immediate action. Delaying treatment can lead to irreversible organ damage. While a fluid bolus might be necessary, Lactated Ringer's is the preferred fluid for burn resuscitation to buffer acidosis, and the overall rate, not just a single bolus, likely needs adjustment. Requesting 0.9% sodium chloride could contribute to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis when given in large volumes, especially in the context of burn resuscitation where large volumes of fluid are often required.",

        "content": "This is incorrect. The client's hypotension is primarily due to hypovolemia from the burn injury (distributive/hypovolemic shock). The primary treatment is aggressive fluid replacement to restore intravascular volume. Administering a vasopressor before adequate volume resuscitation can worsen organ and tissue ischemia by constricting already poorly perfused vessels that are already struggling due to low blood volume. This can lead to further cellular damage and organ dysfunction.",

While more fluid is needed, Lactated Ringer's is the crystalloid of choice in burn resuscitation because its composition is more similar to plasma and it helps buffer the metabolic acidosis that occurs with burns. Large volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which can further compromise organ function. The primary action should be to advocate for an adjustment of the current, appropriate fluid infusion rate (Lactated Ringer's).",
