  "question": "A 38-year-old female with a 5-year history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) presents to the neurology clinic. She reports a one-week history of increased fatigue, new-onset numbness and tingling in her left leg, and blurred vision in her right eye. She mentions experiencing significant stress recently and had an upper respiratory infection two weeks ago. The provider confirms an acute MS relapse. The nurse is preparing the plan of care. Which nursing actions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

    "opt_1": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "High-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are the first-line treatment for acute MS relapses. They reduce inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) by suppressing the immune response. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, the protective covering of nerve fibers, leading to demyelination and neurological dysfunction. Corticosteroids decrease the migration of inflammatory cells into the CNS, reducing edema and promoting nerve impulse transmission. This helps to shorten the duration and severity of the relapse.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for side effects of corticosteroids, including hyperglycemia, mood changes, fluid retention, and increased risk of infection. Administer with food to minimize gastric irritation."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. It is not caused by an infectious agent and is not communicable. Therefore, contact precautions are not indicated and would be inappropriate. Implementing unnecessary isolation measures can increase the client's anxiety and feelings of isolation.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Focus on providing emotional support and education about the disease process rather than implementing unnecessary isolation measures."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Profound fatigue is a hallmark symptom of MS, often exacerbated during relapses. This fatigue is multifactorial, resulting from demyelination, inflammation, and the body's compensatory mechanisms. Planning rest periods between activities helps conserve energy and prevents overexertion, which can worsen symptoms. Energy conservation strategies are crucial for maintaining functional abilities and improving quality of life.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Teach the client to prioritize activities, delegate tasks when possible, and pace themselves throughout the day. Encourage the use of assistive devices to reduce energy expenditure."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "While regular, moderate exercise is beneficial for long-term MS management, vigorous exercise is contraindicated during an acute relapse. Vigorous activity can increase body temperature, potentially exacerbating neurological symptoms due to Uhthoff's phenomenon, where heat sensitivity worsens nerve conduction. It can also lead to increased fatigue and muscle spasticity.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Advise the client to avoid strenuous activities during a relapse and to consult with a physical therapist for a tailored exercise program once the acute phase subsides. Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises may be appropriate."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "The client's new-onset numbness in the left leg and blurred vision in the right eye significantly increase the risk of falls. Sensory deficits impair balance and coordination, while visual disturbances affect depth perception and spatial awareness. A standardized fall risk assessment, such as the Morse Fall Scale, identifies specific risk factors and guides the implementation of preventative measures, such as assistive devices, environmental modifications, and close monitoring.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Implement fall precautions, such as ensuring adequate lighting, removing tripping hazards, and providing assistive devices like canes or walkers. Educate the client and family about fall prevention strategies."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Applying heat, such as warm compresses, is generally contraindicated for clients with MS. Heat can temporarily worsen neurological symptoms, a phenomenon known as Uhthoff's phenomenon. Increased temperature impairs nerve conduction in demyelinated nerves, leading to a transient exacerbation of symptoms like numbness, tingling, and weakness.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Cooling measures, such as cool compresses or fans, may provide more relief. Advise the client to avoid hot baths, saunas, and excessive sun exposure."
    },
    "opt_7": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Clients with MS are at increased risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to potential neurogenic bladder dysfunction, which can result in incomplete bladder emptying. Adequate hydration helps prevent UTIs by flushing bacteria from the urinary tract. Additionally, corticosteroids can cause fluid retention and constipation, and increased fluid intake helps mitigate these side effects.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor urine output and signs of UTI, such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Encourage the client to drink at least 2-3 liters of fluid per day, unless contraindicated by other medical conditions."
