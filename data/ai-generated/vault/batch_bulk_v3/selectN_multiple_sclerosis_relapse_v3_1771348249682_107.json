    "question": "A 38-year-old female with a 5-year history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) presents to the neurology clinic. She reports a one-week history of increased fatigue, new-onset numbness and tingling in her left leg, and blurred vision in her right eye. She mentions experiencing significant stress recently and had an upper respiratory infection two weeks ago. The provider confirms an acute MS relapse. The nurse is preparing the plan of care. Which nursing actions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

            "rationale": "High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are the standard, first-line treatment for acute MS relapses. They work by reducing inflammation in the central nervous system, which can shorten the duration and severity of the exacerbation."

            "isCorrect": false,

            "rationale": "Profound fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of MS, and it is significantly exacerbated during a relapse.

            "rationale": "Applying heat (warm compresses) is contraindicated for clients with MS. Heat can cause a temporary worsening of neurological symptoms, a phenomenon known as Uhthoff's phenomenon. This intervention could exacerbate the client's current symptoms."

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Clients with MS are at higher risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to potential neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Promoting adequate hydration helps prevent UTIs and also aids in managing constipation, which can be a side effect of decreased mobility and corticosteroid therapy."
