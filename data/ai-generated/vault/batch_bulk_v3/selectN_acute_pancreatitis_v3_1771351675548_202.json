    "question": "A 45-year-old client with a history of chronic alcohol use is admitted to the medical-surgical unit from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The nurse completes the initial assessment. The client reports severe, sharp, epigastric pain radiating to the back, rated 10/10. The client is restless and guarding their abdomen. Assessment findings: Temperature 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate 122 beats/min, respiratory rate 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 94/58 mmHg, SpO2 93% on room air. The abdomen is distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. The nurse is developing the initial plan of care. Which actions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of managing acute pancreatitis. The client is hypotensive (94/58 mmHg) and tachycardic (122 beats/min), indicating hypovolemia from third-spacing of fluids into the retroperitoneal space. Administering isotonic crystalloids like lactated Ringer's at a high rate is critical to maintain hemodynamic stability and perfuse vital organs, including the pancreas itself."

        "opt_2": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Maintaining NPO status is essential to 'rest' the pancreas. Oral intake of food and fluids stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes (e.g., amylase, lipase), which exacerbates the autodigestion process, inflammation, and pain associated with acute pancreatitis. Bowel rest is a primary intervention until symptoms subside."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Severe pain (rated 10/10) is the cardinal symptom of acute pancreatitis. IV opioid analgesics are required for effective pain management. A PCA pump allows the client to self-administer small, controlled doses, providing consistent pain relief, which can also help decrease metabolic stress and oxygen demand."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Nasogastric (NG) tube placement for suction is not a routine intervention for all cases of acute pancreatitis. It is typically reserved for clients with severe, persistent vomiting, gastric distention, or evidence of a paralytic ileus. While this client has a distended abdomen, the indication is not strong enough to make it a universal initial action without further evidence of intractable nausea or ileus."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "A supine position often increases abdominal tension and pain in clients with acute pancreatitis. A more comfortable position is typically side-lying with the knees flexed toward the chest or a fetal position, as this reduces stretching of the abdominal muscles and peritoneal irritation."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Clients with acute pancreatitis are at high risk for respiratory complications, such as atelectasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to severe pain limiting chest excursion, abdominal distention pushing on the diaphragm, and systemic inflammation. Encouraging incentive spirometry helps to promote deep breathing, prevent alveolar collapse, and reduce the risk of these life-threatening complications."
        },
        "opt_7": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Pancrelipase is a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. It is used for clients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency to aid in digestion. Administering these enzymes during an acute pancreatitis episode is contraindicated as it would worsen the autodigestion of the already inflamed pancreas."
