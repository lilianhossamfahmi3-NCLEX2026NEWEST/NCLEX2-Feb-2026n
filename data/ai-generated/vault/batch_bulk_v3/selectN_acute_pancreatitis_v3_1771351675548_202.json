  "question": "A 45-year-old client with a history of chronic alcohol use is admitted to the medical-surgical unit from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The nurse completes the initial assessment. The client reports severe, sharp, epigastric pain radiating to the back, rated 10/10. The client is restless and guarding their abdomen. Assessment findings: Temperature 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate 122 beats/min, respiratory rate 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 94/58 mmHg, SpO2 93% on room air. The abdomen is distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. The nurse is developing the initial plan of care. Which actions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

    "opt_1": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation is crucial in managing acute pancreatitis. The client's hypotension (94/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (122 beats/min) indicate hypovolemia due to fluid shifts into the retroperitoneal space. Lactated Ringer's (LR) is an isotonic crystalloid solution that expands intravascular volume, improving blood pressure and organ perfusion. A rate of 200 mL/hr is appropriate given the client's hemodynamic instability. \n\nPathophysiology: Pancreatic inflammation leads to increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage into the interstitial space, causing hypovolemia and potentially leading to acute kidney injury and shock. LR helps restore circulating volume and prevent these complications.\n\nClinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload, such as crackles in the lungs and edema, during aggressive fluid resuscitation. Adjust the infusion rate as needed based on the client's response.",

    },
    "opt_2": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Maintaining strict NPO status is essential to reduce pancreatic stimulation. Oral intake triggers the release of pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase), exacerbating the autodigestion process and inflammation. Bowel rest allows the pancreas to recover. \n\nPathophysiology: In acute pancreatitis, premature activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas leads to autodigestion and inflammation. NPO status minimizes pancreatic secretions, reducing the severity of the inflammatory process.\n\nClinical Pearl: Provide meticulous oral care to maintain comfort and prevent complications associated with prolonged NPO status.",

    },
    "opt_3": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Severe pain (10/10) is a hallmark of acute pancreatitis. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine provides consistent pain relief. Morphine is an opioid analgesic that effectively manages severe pain by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing the perception of pain.\n\nPathophysiology: Pancreatic inflammation and edema irritate nerve endings, causing intense abdominal pain that can radiate to the back. Effective pain management reduces stress and promotes healing.\n\nClinical Pearl: Monitor for adverse effects of morphine, such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and constipation. Administer antiemetics as needed to manage nausea and vomiting.",

    },
    "opt_4": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: Nasogastric (NG) tube placement is not a routine intervention for all acute pancreatitis cases. It is indicated for clients with severe vomiting, gastric distention, or paralytic ileus. While the client has abdominal distention, further assessment is needed to determine if an NG tube is necessary. \n\nPathophysiology: An NG tube can decompress the stomach, reducing pressure on the pancreas and preventing aspiration in clients with severe vomiting. However, routine use can increase the risk of complications such as sinusitis and esophageal irritation.\n\nClinical Pearl: Assess the client for persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention before considering NG tube placement.",

    },
    "opt_5": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: A supine position with legs extended can increase abdominal tension and pain. A more comfortable position is side-lying with knees flexed or a fetal position, which reduces stretching of abdominal muscles and peritoneal irritation.\n\nPathophysiology: Flexing the knees and hips reduces tension on the abdominal muscles, decreasing pain and promoting relaxation.\n\nClinical Pearl: Encourage the client to find a position of comfort and provide pillows for support.",
      "scoring": "+/-"
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct: Clients with acute pancreatitis are at risk for respiratory complications (atelectasis, ARDS) due to pain limiting chest excursion, abdominal distention, and systemic inflammation. Incentive spirometry promotes deep breathing, prevents alveolar collapse, and reduces the risk of these complications.\n\nPathophysiology: Abdominal distention and pain can restrict diaphragmatic movement, leading to shallow breathing and decreased oxygenation. Incentive spirometry helps expand the lungs and improve gas exchange.\n\nClinical Pearl: Teach the client how to use the incentive spirometer correctly and encourage frequent use (e.g., 10 breaths every hour). Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory effort.",

    "opt_7": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect: Pancrelipase is a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy used for chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency to aid digestion. It is contraindicated during an acute pancreatitis episode as it would worsen the autodigestion of the inflamed pancreas.\n\nPathophysiology: Administering exogenous pancreatic enzymes during acute inflammation would exacerbate the digestive process within the pancreas, increasing inflammation and pain.\n\nClinical Pearl: Pancrelipase is typically prescribed after the acute phase of pancreatitis has resolved and the client is able to tolerate oral intake.",
