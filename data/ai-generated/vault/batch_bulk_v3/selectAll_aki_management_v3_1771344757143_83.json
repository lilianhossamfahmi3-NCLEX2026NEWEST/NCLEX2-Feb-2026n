    "correct": "The client is exhibiting life-threatening complications of AKI secondary to sepsis. The elevated potassium (6.8 mEq/L) indicates severe hyperkalemia, which can lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28, HCO3 18 mEq/L) further exacerbates hyperkalemia by shifting potassium extracellularly. Fluid overload, evidenced by crackles, JVD, edema, and hypertension, compromises respiratory function and increases cardiac workload. Oliguria (urine output 15 mL/hr) indicates impaired renal excretion of fluids and electrolytes. Immediate interventions are crucial to stabilize the client and prevent cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmias. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) helps lower potassium levels by exchanging sodium for potassium in the intestines, promoting potassium excretion. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can help reduce fluid overload by promoting renal excretion of sodium and water, provided there is some residual kidney function. Emergent hemodialysis is indicated to remove excess fluid, correct electrolyte imbalances (hyperkalemia), and resolve metabolic acidosis when conservative measures are insufficient.",
    "incorrect": "Administering fluids (oral or IV) to a client who is oliguric and fluid-overloaded would exacerbate pulmonary edema and hypertension, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is contraindicated in hyperkalemia as it would further elevate potassium levels, increasing the risk of cardiac arrest. The incorrect options would actively harm the client by worsening the existing fluid volume excess and life-threatening hyperkalemia.",

        "content": "Incorrect. The client is experiencing severe fluid volume overload, as evidenced by hypertension (178/96 mmHg), JVD, bilateral crackles, and 3+ pitting edema. Administering an IV fluid bolus would worsen this fluid overload, potentially leading to acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. This is contraindicated in the setting of AKI and fluid overload.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Correct. A serum potassium of 6.8 mEq/L constitutes severe hyperkalemia, which places the client at extremely high risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection and treatment of these arrhythmias. The nurse must be vigilant for changes on the ECG and be prepared to administer medications like calcium gluconate to stabilize the myocardium.",

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a potassium-binding resin that works in the gastrointestinal tract to bind with potassium and facilitate its excretion from the body through the feces, thereby lowering the serum potassium level. It is crucial to monitor bowel function as constipation can limit its effectiveness.",

The refractory hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28), profound fluid overload, and uremia (BUN 88) indicate that the kidneys have failed and renal replacement therapy is required immediately to sustain life.

While the kidneys are injured, a high dose of a potent loop diuretic like furosemide may still provoke a diuretic response to help excrete excess fluid.

Administering this medication to a client with a life-threatening potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L is absolutely contraindicated and would be a critical error, as it would cause the potassium level to rise even further, increasing the risk of imminent cardiac arrest.
