    "stem": "The nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 68-year-old female client brought in by family for profound lethargy. The client has a history of hypothyroidism and ran out of levothyroxine two weeks ago. Assessment findings include unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli, rectal temperature of 94.8°F (34.9°C), heart rate of 48/min, respiratory rate of 10/min and shallow, and blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg. The provider diagnoses the client with myxedema coma. Which interventions should the nurse anticipate and prepare to implement? Select all that apply.",

                "point": "Administer IV levothyroxine as prescribed.",
                "explanation": "This is the primary treatment for myxedema coma. IV administration is crucial because severe hypothyroidism causes decreased gastrointestinal motility and absorption, making the oral route unreliable. IV thyroid hormone replacement begins to reverse the profound metabolic and cardiovascular effects of the condition."
            },
            "opt_2": {
                "point": "Initiate passive rewarming with warm blankets.",
                "explanation": "The client is severely hypothermic. Passive rewarming using blankets is the recommended method. Active rewarming (e.g., heating pads, forced-air warmers) is contraindicated as it can cause rapid peripheral vasodilation, leading to a further drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse."
            },
            "opt_3": {
                "point": "Administer a rapid 1-liter bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride.",
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. While the client is hypotensive, fluid administration must be done cautiously. The hypotension is primarily due to decreased cardiac contractility and bradycardia, not just hypovolemia. Rapid fluid boluses can precipitate heart failure and worsen hyponatremia, which is common in myxedema coma."
            },
            "opt_4": {
                "point": "Prepare for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
                "explanation": "This is a priority intervention. The client's unresponsiveness, shallow respirations (hypoventilation), and hypoxia indicate severe respiratory depression, a hallmark of myxedema coma. The client is at high risk for airway compromise and requires mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation."
            },
            "opt_5": {
                "point": "Administer a sedative to prevent agitation upon arousal.",
                "explanation": "This is incorrect and dangerous. The client is already in a state of severe central nervous system depression. Administering sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids) would further depress respiratory drive and mental status, worsening the coma and potentially leading to respiratory arrest."
            },
            "opt_6": {
                "point": "Administer IV hydrocortisone as prescribed.",
                "explanation": "This is a critical intervention. Myxedema coma can be associated with or precipitate adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis). Administering thyroid hormone without concurrent glucocorticoid support in a patient with adrenal insufficiency can be fatal. Therefore, IV corticosteroids are given until coexisting adrenal failure is ruled out."
            },
            "opt_7": {
                "point": "Administer a beta-blocker to manage cardiovascular strain.",
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. The client's bradycardia and hypotension are direct consequences of severe hypothyroidism. A beta-blocker would further decrease heart rate and cardiac contractility, exacerbating the hypotension and potentially leading to complete cardiovascular collapse. The treatment is thyroid hormone replacement, which will gradually correct the heart rate."
