    "rationale": "The client at 36 weeks gestation presents with signs and symptoms indicative of severe preeclampsia, including a severe headache, visual disturbances (scotoma), nausea, elevated blood pressure (168/112 mmHg), hyperreflexia (+4 DTRs), clonus, and proteinuria (3+). These findings suggest significant central nervous system (CNS) irritability and a high risk of eclamptic seizure, as well as potential end-organ damage. The priority is to stabilize the client and prevent complications such as seizures, stroke, and placental abruption. The order of actions is based on addressing the most immediate threats to maternal safety while also considering fetal well-being.",

        "justification": "Initiating seizure precautions is the highest priority. The client's neurological symptoms (severe headache, visual disturbances, hyperreflexia, clonus) indicate severe CNS irritability, placing her at imminent risk for an eclamptic seizure. Eclampsia is a life-threatening complication of preeclampsia characterized by seizures. Implementing seizure precautions, such as padding side rails, ensuring suction equipment is readily available, and having oxygen readily available, is crucial to prevent injury and maintain a patent airway if a seizure occurs. This is a critical safety intervention to protect the client from harm. **Clinical Pearl:** Never leave a patient at risk for seizure unattended.",

        "justification": "Obtaining IV access and initiating a magnesium sulfate infusion is the second priority. Magnesium sulfate is the primary medication used to prevent and treat eclamptic seizures. It acts as a CNS depressant, reducing neuronal excitability and preventing seizures. Rapid administration of magnesium sulfate is essential to prevent seizure activity and protect the client from the potentially devastating consequences of eclampsia. The medication also has a mild antihypertensive effect. **Pathophysiology:** Magnesium sulfate works by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing CNS excitability. It also causes vasodilation, which can help lower blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for magnesium toxicity (decreased respiratory rate, absent DTRs, altered mental status) during infusion. Have calcium gluconate available as an antidote.",

        "justification": "Administering labetalol 20 mg IV push as prescribed is the third priority. The client's blood pressure of 168/112 mmHg is dangerously elevated, indicating severe hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension in preeclampsia can lead to cerebrovascular accident (stroke), placental abruption, and other serious complications. Labetalol is an antihypertensive medication that rapidly lowers blood pressure by blocking alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, causing vasodilation without significantly affecting heart rate. While seizure prevention is the top priority, controlling severe hypertension is also a critical, life-saving intervention that must be done promptly after initiating seizure prophylaxis. **Pathophysiology:** Labetalol reduces blood pressure by blocking alpha-1 receptors (causing vasodilation) and beta-1 receptors (reducing heart rate and contractility). **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood pressure closely after administration to avoid precipitous drops, which can compromise placental perfusion.",

        "justification": "Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is the fourth priority. This is essential for two main reasons: 1) It allows for strict monitoring of urine output, a key indicator of kidney perfusion and a marker for worsening preeclampsia (oliguria is a severe feature). Decreased urine output can indicate renal dysfunction and impending kidney failure. 2) Magnesium sulfate is excreted renally, and adequate urine output (at least 30 mL/hr) is necessary to prevent magnesium toxicity. This intervention is crucial for monitoring and ongoing management but comes after the immediate life-saving medications are administered. **Clinical Pearl:** Report urine output less than 30 mL/hr to the healthcare provider immediately.",

        "justification": "Placing the client on a continuous external fetal monitor is the final priority in this sequence. While fetal assessment is vital, the immediate life threats are to the mother. The principle of 'maternal stabilization first' applies, as a stable mother is the best environment for the fetus. Continuous fetal monitoring allows for assessment of fetal heart rate patterns, which can indicate fetal distress secondary to maternal hypertension, placental insufficiency, or other complications. However, this is a lower priority than addressing the immediate maternal risks. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns (e.g., late decelerations, decreased variability), which may indicate fetal compromise.",
