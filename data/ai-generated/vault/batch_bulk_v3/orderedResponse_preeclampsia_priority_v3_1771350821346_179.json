        "rationale": "The client is exhibiting signs of severe preeclampsia with features indicating central nervous system (CNS) irritability (severe headache, visual disturbances, hyperreflexia, clonus), placing her at imminent risk for an eclamptic seizure. The nurse's priority is to implement actions that ensure maternal safety first, as maternal stability is essential for fetal well-being. The correct sequence follows the principle of addressing the most immediate life-threatening risks first.",

                "justification": "The highest priority action is to initiate seizure precautions. The client's neurological symptoms (+4 DTRs, clonus, headache, visual changes) indicate severe CNS irritability and a high risk of an imminent eclamptic seizure. Ensuring a safe environment (padded side rails, suction available, oxygen ready) is a critical first step to prevent injury and manage the airway if a seizure occurs. This is a primary safety intervention."

                "rank": 2,
                "justification": "The second priority is to obtain IV access and start the magnesium sulfate infusion. Magnesium sulfate is the primary medication used to prevent and treat eclamptic seizures by acting as a CNS depressant. This directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology causing the seizure risk. This intervention should be initiated as soon as possible after ensuring the environment is safe."

                "rank": 3,
                "justification": "The third priority is to administer the IV antihypertensive, labetalol. The client's blood pressure of 168/112 mmHg is dangerously elevated and requires urgent treatment to prevent a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) or placental abruption. While seizure prevention is the top priority, controlling severe-range hypertension is also a critical, life-saving intervention that must be done promptly after initiating seizure prophylaxis."

                "rank": 4,
                "justification": "The fourth priority is to insert an indwelling urinary catheter. This is essential for two main reasons in this client: 1) It allows for strict monitoring of urine output, a key indicator of kidney perfusion and a marker for worsening preeclampsia (oliguria is a severe feature). 2) Magnesium sulfate is excreted renally, and adequate urine output (at least 30 mL/hr) is necessary to prevent magnesium toxicity. This intervention is crucial for monitoring and ongoing management but comes after the immediate life-saving medications are administered."

                "justification": "The final priority in this sequence is to place the client on a continuous fetal monitor. While fetal assessment is vital, the immediate life threats are to the mother. The principle of 'maternal stabilization first' applies, as a stable mother is the best environment for the fetus. Fetal monitoring should be initiated once the immediate, life-saving maternal interventions are underway."
