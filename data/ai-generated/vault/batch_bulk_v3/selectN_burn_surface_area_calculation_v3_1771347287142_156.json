    "correct": "The client has sustained major burns (28% TBSA: Back=18%, Anterior Left Leg=9%, Perineum=1%), necessitating immediate interventions to prevent complications like hypovolemic shock and infection. Inserting two large-bore IV catheters is crucial for rapid fluid resuscitation using the Parkland formula. Covering the client with a clean, dry sheet prevents hypothermia due to impaired thermoregulation from skin loss. Tetanus toxoid administration is essential due to the disrupted skin barrier, which increases the risk of Clostridium tetani infection. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Major burns cause increased capillary permeability, leading to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, resulting in hypovolemia and burn shock. The loss of skin integrity also eliminates the body's primary defense against infection and impairs thermoregulation.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation is paramount in burn management to maintain organ perfusion and prevent irreversible shock. Hypothermia can significantly worsen outcomes by increasing metabolic demands and impairing coagulation.",
    "incorrect": "Applying ice packs is contraindicated as it can cause vasoconstriction, exacerbating tissue damage and increasing the risk of hypothermia. Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely administered due to the risk of antibiotic resistance; they are reserved for confirmed infections. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Applying ice to burn areas causes vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to already compromised tissues, potentially worsening ischemia and necrosis. Routine antibiotic use promotes the development of resistant bacterial strains, making subsequent infections more difficult to treat.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Avoid ice application to burns. Monitor for signs of infection (e.g., fever, increased WBC count, purulent drainage) before initiating antibiotic therapy.",
