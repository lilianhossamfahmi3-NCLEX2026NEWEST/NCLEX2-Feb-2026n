The client has full-thickness burns on his entire back and partial-thickness burns on the entire anterior surface of his left leg and the perineum.

        "correct": "The initial management of a major burn injury focuses on stopping the burning process, ensuring a patent airway, providing adequate fluid resuscitation, preventing hypothermia, and addressing pain and wound care. The calculated TBSA is 28% (Back=18%, Anterior Left Leg=9%, Perineum=1%), which qualifies as a major burn. Therefore, aggressive fluid resuscitation is the highest priority after airway management. This requires establishing reliable IV access with two large-bore catheters. Preventing heat loss with a dry sheet is crucial as burn victims cannot thermoregulate. Tetanus prophylaxis is also a standard of care due to the compromised skin barrier.",
        "incorrect": "Applying ice is contraindicated as it can cause vasoconstriction, leading to further tissue damage and hypothermia. Prophylactic IV antibiotics are not routinely recommended for burn patients due to the risk of promoting antibiotic-resistant organisms; they are typically reserved for treating active infections.",
