  "question": "The nurse is developing a plan of care for a 34-year-old female client admitted with a new diagnosis of Graves' disease. The client is restless, has a fine tremor in her hands, and reports feeling 'anxious and hot all the time.' Vital signs are: T 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 124/min, RR 22/min, BP 146/82 mmHg. The client also has mild exophthalmos. Which actions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

      {
        "key": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Correct. Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder, causes the thyroid gland to produce excessive thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). This hypermetabolic state leads to increased energy expenditure, protein catabolism, and potential weight loss. Providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet with frequent small meals helps meet the increased metabolic demands, prevent negative nitrogen balance, and support tissue repair. This also helps to minimize gastrointestinal distress often associated with hyperthyroidism.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Frequent small meals are better tolerated than large meals due to increased gastric motility in hyperthyroidism. Consult with a registered dietitian for optimal nutritional support."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, is used to manage the adrenergic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Excess thyroid hormones increase the sensitivity of adrenergic receptors, leading to symptoms like tachycardia, tremors, anxiety, and palpitations. Propranolol blocks these receptors, providing rapid symptomatic relief by decreasing heart rate, reducing tremors, and alleviating anxiety. It does not affect thyroid hormone levels but manages the peripheral effects.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Beta-blockers are contraindicated in clients with asthma or certain heart conditions. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate closely after administration. Educate the client about potential side effects like dizziness and fatigue."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "Correct. Exophthalmos, the abnormal protrusion of the eyeballs, is a characteristic feature of Graves' disease caused by inflammation and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the retro-orbital tissues. This prevents complete eyelid closure, leading to corneal dryness, irritation, and potential ulceration. Instilling artificial tears provides lubrication, protects the cornea from damage, and reduces discomfort.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Instruct the client to blink frequently and wear sunglasses to protect the eyes from light sensitivity. Elevate the head of the bed at night to reduce periorbital edema."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_6",
        "rationale": "Correct. A sudden increase in temperature and severe tachycardia can indicate thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis), a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid storm is characterized by extreme hyperthermia, severe tachycardia, agitation, delirium, and potentially heart failure. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent mortality. Immediate interventions include cooling measures, beta-blockers, antithyroid medications, and supportive care.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Thyroid storm can be precipitated by infection, surgery, or trauma in individuals with poorly controlled hyperthyroidism. Be vigilant for early signs and symptoms, and report any concerns to the healthcare provider immediately."
      }
    ],
    "incorrect": [
      {
        "key": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's restlessness is a manifestation of nervous system overstimulation due to excess thyroid hormones. Encouraging physical activity would further increase the metabolic rate, exacerbate cardiac workload, and worsen the client's anxiety and restlessness. A calm, quiet environment with limited stimulation is more appropriate.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Provide a quiet and darkened room to minimize stimulation. Encourage relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Clients with hyperthyroidism experience heat intolerance due to their hypermetabolic state and increased heat production. A warm room and extra blankets would cause significant discomfort, increase body temperature, and potentially lead to hyperthermia. A cool, quiet environment with light clothing is indicated to promote comfort and prevent overheating.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the room is well-ventilated and consider using a fan to help the client stay cool. Provide cool cloths or compresses for added comfort."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_7",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. While blood pressure may be elevated due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state in hyperthyroidism, restricting sodium and fluid intake is generally not indicated unless there is a specific comorbidity such as heart failure or renal insufficiency. Clients with hyperthyroidism are at risk for dehydration due to increased metabolic demands, diaphoresis, and potential diarrhea. Adequate fluid intake is essential to maintain hydration and prevent complications.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Monitor fluid balance closely and encourage oral fluid intake. Assess for signs of dehydration, such as dry mucous membranes and decreased urine output."
