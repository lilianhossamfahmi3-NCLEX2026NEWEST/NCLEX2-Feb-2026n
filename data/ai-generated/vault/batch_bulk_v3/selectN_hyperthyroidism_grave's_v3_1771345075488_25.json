    "question": "The nurse is developing a plan of care for a 34-year-old female client admitted with a new diagnosis of Graves' disease. The client is restless, has a fine tremor in her hands, and reports feeling 'anxious and hot all the time.' Vital signs are: T 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 124/min, RR 22/min, BP 146/82 mmHg. The client also has mild exophthalmos. Which actions should the nurse include in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

A diet high in calories and protein is essential to meet these increased energy demands and prevent a negative nitrogen balance."
