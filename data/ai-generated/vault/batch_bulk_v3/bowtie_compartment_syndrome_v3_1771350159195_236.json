The key findings are pain disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by opioids (a cardinal sign), paresthesia ('pins and needles'), a tense and swollen compartment, and signs of decreased perfusion (pallor, coolness, weak pulse). Immediate nursing actions are to notify the provider, as surgical fasciotomy is required, and to position the limb at the level of the heart (not elevated) to optimize arterial inflow without increasing venous pressure. Monitoring should focus on signs of worsening ischemia, such as limb temperature (poikilothermia), and for systemic complications like rhabdomyolysis, which is indicated by rising urine myoglobin levels as muscle tissue breaks down.",

DVT involves unilateral edema and pain, but not the severe, tense swelling and paresthesia of ACS. Infection would present later with fever and purulent drainage. While the pain is severe, the constellation of neurovascular deficits points away from simple hyperalgesia. Incorrect actions like elevation would worsen arterial ischemia, while applying an SCD would further increase external pressure on the compromised compartment. Incorrect parameters like WBC or coagulation studies are not primary indicators for ACS.",
