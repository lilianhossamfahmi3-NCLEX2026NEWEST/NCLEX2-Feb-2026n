States the pain is worse than it was 2 hours ago and is not relieved by the PCA pump, which he has been pressing frequently. He describes a 'pins and needles' sensation in his left foot. The left calf is visibly swollen, tense, and firm to the touch compared to the right. Left foot is cool and pale. Capillary refill is 3 seconds on the left great toe. Dorsalis pedis pulse is palpable but weak."

    "correct": "The client is most likely experiencing acute compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS occurs when swelling or bleeding within a confined muscle compartment increases pressure, compromising circulation and nerve function. In this case, the ORIF of the tibial fracture has likely led to edema and potential bleeding within the lower leg compartments. The client's severe pain (9/10) unrelieved by morphine, paresthesia ('pins and needles'), tense and swollen calf, pallor, coolness, and weak pulse are all indicative of ACS. \n\nThe nurse should immediately notify the healthcare provider, as ACS requires prompt surgical intervention (fasciotomy) to relieve the pressure. Placing the affected limb at the level of the heart optimizes arterial perfusion without increasing venous pressure, which could worsen edema. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it can further reduce arterial blood flow to the already ischemic tissues. \n\nMonitoring urine myoglobin levels is crucial to detect rhabdomyolysis, a complication of ACS where damaged muscle tissue releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, potentially leading to kidney injury. Monitoring the temperature of the affected limb helps assess the degree of ischemia; a cool limb indicates reduced blood flow.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   **Fat Embolism Syndrome:** Typically presents with respiratory distress, neurological changes, and a petechial rash, none of which are present here.\n*   **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** Causes unilateral edema and pain, but not the severe, tense swelling, paresthesia, and pallor characteristic of ACS.\n*   **Surgical Site Infection:** Develops later, with fever, erythema, and purulent drainage.\n*   **Opioid-induced Hyperalgesia:** While possible, it doesn't explain the objective physical findings of a tense, swollen calf, pallor, coolness, and paresthesia.\n\nIncorrect actions like applying an SCD or elevating the limb would worsen the condition.
