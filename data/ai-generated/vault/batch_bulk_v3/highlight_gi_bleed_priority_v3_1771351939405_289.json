Client is alert but [h]is increasingly restless and confused[/h] compared to admission assessment. Currently [h]complaining of moderate epigastric pain[/h]. This morning's labs showed a [h]hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL[/h]. Vital signs at 1830 were: [h]heart rate is 118/min[/h], respiratory rate is 22/min, [h]blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg[/h], and [h]SpO2 is 94% on room air[/h]. The [h]abdomen is soft and non-distended[/h]. An 18-gauge peripheral IV is in place with 0.9% sodium chloride infusing at 75 mL/hr. The [h]urine output has been 40 mL over the last 2 hours[/h].",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of hypovolemic shock secondary to a GI bleed. Tachycardia (HR 118/min) is an early compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output with decreased blood volume. Hypotension (BP 88/52 mmHg) indicates decompensation and inadequate tissue perfusion. Altered mental status (restlessness, confusion) reflects cerebral hypoperfusion. Oliguria (urine output 40 mL over 2 hours) signifies decreased renal perfusion as blood is shunted to vital organs. These findings necessitate immediate intervention to restore circulating volume and oxygen delivery.",
    "incorrect": "While epigastric pain is expected with a GI bleed, it's not the priority over hemodynamic stabilization. A hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL from earlier in the day may not reflect the current blood loss. An SpO2 of 94% is acceptable but should be monitored. A soft, non-distended abdomen is a normal finding. Addressing the signs of shock is paramount.",

Assessment: Restless, confused, epigastric pain, HR 118, BP 88/52, RR 22, SpO2 94%, UO 40 mL/2 hrs. Recommendation: Immediate fluid resuscitation, notify provider, prepare for possible endoscopy."
