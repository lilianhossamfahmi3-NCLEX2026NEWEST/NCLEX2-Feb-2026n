These findings represent a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention, such as rapid fluid resuscitation, blood product administration, and preparation for an emergent procedure like an endoscopy.",

Epigastric pain is an expected symptom but is secondary to hemodynamic instability. The morning hemoglobin is old data and does not reflect the client's current, acute blood loss. A stable SpO2 and a soft abdomen are reassuring findings that do not indicate an immediate crisis. The priority is to address the signs of systemic circulatory collapse.",
