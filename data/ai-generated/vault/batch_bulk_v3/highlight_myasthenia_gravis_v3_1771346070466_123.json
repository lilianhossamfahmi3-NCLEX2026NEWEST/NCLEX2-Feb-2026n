    "context": "Nurse's Progress Note, 0800:\nClient was awake and alert. Temperature is 38.2° C (100.8° F). Reports feeling more tired than yesterday. States they have had increased difficulty swallowing water this morning. Crackles are noted in bilateral lower lobes upon auscultation. The client is speaking in short, quiet sentences. They report their usual baseline double vision when reading the menu. Oxygen saturation has dropped from 96% to 91% on room air over the last hour. Client states they feel 'too weak to cough effectively'. Next dose of pyridostigmine is due at 0900.",

    "correct": "Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening exacerbation of myasthenia gravis characterized by severe muscle weakness, leading to respiratory failure. It occurs when the respiratory muscles and bulbar muscles (responsible for swallowing and speech) become critically weak. In this scenario, the client's pneumonia has likely triggered the crisis. The key findings indicating this are: increased difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) due to bulbar muscle weakness, leading to aspiration risk; short, quiet sentences (dysphonia) reflecting respiratory muscle fatigue and reduced vital capacity; declining oxygen saturation indicating ineffective gas exchange; and a weak cough, impairing the ability to clear secretions, increasing the risk of pneumonia worsening and airway obstruction. These findings necessitate immediate intervention to support ventilation and prevent respiratory arrest.",
    "incorrect": "Fever (38.2° C/100.8° F) and crackles are indicative of the underlying pneumonia, which is a trigger for the myasthenic crisis, but not direct manifestations of the crisis itself. While important to treat, they are secondary to the immediate threat of respiratory failure. Baseline double vision is a chronic symptom of myasthenia gravis and, unless acutely worsened, does not indicate a crisis. Focusing on the acute changes in respiratory and bulbar function is crucial for identifying and managing myasthenic crisis.",

    "Situation": "1200: A 58-year-old client with myasthenia gravis, admitted for community-acquired pneumonia, is exhibiting signs of a potential myasthenic crisis.",
    "Background": "The client was admitted 12 hours ago and is receiving IV antibiotics. The client has a history of myasthenia gravis managed with pyridostigmine, next dose due at 0900.",
    "Assessment": "The client reports increased fatigue and difficulty swallowing. Oxygen saturation has decreased from 96% to 91% on room air. The client is speaking in short, quiet sentences and reports feeling too weak to cough effectively. Temperature is 38.2° C (100.8° F), and crackles are noted bilaterally. These findings indicate respiratory muscle weakness and potential respiratory failure.",
    "Recommendation": "I recommend immediate notification of the physician, preparation for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consider holding the next dose of pyridostigmine until respiratory status is stabilized. A STAT respiratory therapy consult is recommended. Prepare for possible administration of IVIG or plasmapheresis per physician orders. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is essential."
