The client is receiving intravenous antibiotics. Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that are most concerning for the development of a myasthenic crisis.",

States they have had increased difficulty swallowing water this morning. Crackles are noted in bilateral lower lobes upon auscultation. The client is speaking in short, quiet sentences. They report their usual baseline double vision when reading the menu. Oxygen saturation has dropped from 96% to 91% on room air over the last hour. Client states they feel 'too weak to cough effectively'. Next dose of pyridostigmine is due at 0900.",

        "correct": "The nurse should recognize cues indicating acute respiratory compromise and bulbar muscle weakness, which are hallmarks of an impending myasthenic crisis, a life-threatening complication of myasthenia gravis often triggered by infection. Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), weak voice (dysphonia), inability to handle secretions, a weak cough, and declining oxygen saturation all point to severe muscle weakness affecting respiration and airway protection. These findings signify impending respiratory failure and require immediate intervention.",
        "incorrect": "While findings like fever and crackles are important, they are signs of the underlying infection (pneumonia), which is the trigger for the crisis, not the crisis itself. The question asks for findings of the crisis. Baseline symptoms of myasthenia gravis, such as chronic double vision, are not indicative of an acute crisis unless there is a significant, sudden worsening, which is not described here. Recognizing the difference between the trigger, baseline symptoms, and the acute life-threatening signs of respiratory failure is critical.",
