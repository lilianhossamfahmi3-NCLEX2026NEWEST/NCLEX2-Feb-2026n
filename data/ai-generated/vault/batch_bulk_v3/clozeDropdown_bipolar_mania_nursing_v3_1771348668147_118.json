    "BLANK_1": {
      "correctAnswer": "gently redirect the client from giving away possessions",
      "rationales": {
        "gently redirect the client from giving away possessions": "Correct: During a manic episode, clients often exhibit impaired judgment and impulsivity due to the neurochemical imbalances in the brain, particularly elevated levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. This can lead to actions like giving away possessions. Redirecting the client gently protects them from potential regret and financial repercussions later. This approach also de-escalates the situation without confrontation.",
        "place the client in a quiet room for seclusion": "Incorrect: Seclusion is a restrictive intervention reserved for situations where the client poses an immediate threat to themselves or others. While the client's behavior is concerning, it does not warrant seclusion at this time. Seclusion can also increase agitation if used inappropriately.",
        "document the client's wish to give away the watch": "Incorrect: Documentation is essential, but it is not the priority action. The nurse must first intervene to prevent the client from acting on their impulsive urges. Failing to intervene could be considered negligence.",
        "encourage the other client to accept the 'gift'": "Incorrect: This action reinforces the client's impaired judgment and could lead to exploitation of the manic client. It also fails to protect the client's belongings and could create conflict later."

    "BLANK_2": {
      "correctAnswer": "high-calorie finger foods and a protein shake",
      "rationales": {
        "a large, nutritionally balanced meal in the dining room": "Incorrect: Clients in a manic state have difficulty sitting still and focusing on a meal due to hyperactivity and distractibility. The dining room environment can be overstimulating, further exacerbating their agitation.",
        "high-calorie finger foods and a protein shake": "Correct: Mania increases metabolic demands, leading to potential weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. High-calorie finger foods and protein shakes provide easily accessible nutrients that the client can consume while moving. This approach addresses the client's nutritional needs without requiring them to sit for an extended period.",
        "caffeinated beverages to help with focus": "Incorrect: Caffeine is a stimulant that can worsen manic symptoms such as hyperactivity, insomnia, and anxiety. It should be avoided in clients experiencing mania.",
        "hot soup and a sandwich on a tray": "Incorrect: While nutritious, this option requires the client to sit down and use utensils, which is challenging due to their hyperactivity. Hot liquids also pose a safety risk due to potential spills and burns."
      }
    },
    "BLANK_3": {
      "correctAnswer": "engage the client in a non-competitive physical activity",
      "rationales": {
        "engage the client in a non-competitive physical activity": "Correct: Physical activity helps to expend excess energy and reduce tension in a safe and constructive manner. Non-competitive activities, such as walking or stretching, minimize the risk of triggering frustration or aggression. The pathophysiology behind this is that physical activity can help regulate neurotransmitter levels, potentially reducing the intensity of the manic episode.",
        "encourage the client to join a competitive group board game": "Incorrect: Competitive activities can increase frustration, agitation, and the risk of aggressive behavior. The client's impaired judgment and impulsivity can lead to conflicts with other clients.",
        "suggest the client remain in their room to conserve energy": "Incorrect: Forcing a hyperactive client to stay in their room is likely to increase their agitation and frustration. It is more therapeutic to provide a safe outlet for their energy.",
        "allow the client to lead a group therapy session": "Incorrect: The client's grandiose delusions, pressured speech, and impaired judgment make them unsuitable to lead a therapy session. This could be disruptive and non-therapeutic for other clients."
      }
    },
    "BLANK_4": {
      "correctAnswer": "use a calm tone and provide firm, simple directions",
      "rationales": {
        "use a calm tone and provide firm, simple directions": "Correct: A calm tone helps to de-escalate the situation and avoid triggering agitation. Firm, simple directions are easier for the client to understand and follow, given their distractibility and impaired cognitive processing. This approach provides structure and reduces anxiety.",
        "ask open-ended questions to explore their feelings": "Incorrect: Open-ended questions can be overwhelming for a client with pressured speech and flight of ideas. They may struggle to organize their thoughts and provide coherent answers, leading to increased frustration.",
        "employ therapeutic silence to encourage self-reflection": "Incorrect: A client in an acute manic state is unlikely to engage in self-reflection. Silence may be misinterpreted or lead to increased anxiety and agitation.",
        "engage in a debate about their grandiose beliefs": "Incorrect: Challenging or debating a client's delusions is counterproductive and can escalate their agitation. It is more effective to focus on reality-based topics and redirect their attention."
