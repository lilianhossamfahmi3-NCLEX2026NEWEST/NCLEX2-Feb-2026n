    "introduction": "This question requires the nurse to analyze the burn assessment findings and apply knowledge of the Lund-Browder chart for a 4-year-old child to accurately calculate the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) percentage for each affected region. Unlike the Rule of Nines for adults, the Lund-Browder chart accounts for the changes in body proportions during childhood, making it more accurate for pediatric clients.",
    "options": [
      {
        "rowId": "row-1",
        "columnId": "col-1",
        "correct": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. 4.5% represents the TBSA for the anterior head of an adult according to the Rule of Nines. In a 4-year-old child, the head is proportionally larger, so this value is an underestimation. The Lund-Browder chart is essential for accurate TBSA calculation in children due to their differing body proportions compared to adults. Using the Rule of Nines in pediatric burns can lead to significant errors in fluid resuscitation and overall management.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Always use the Lund-Browder chart for pediatric burn TBSA calculations. Miscalculation can lead to under or over resuscitation, both with serious consequences."

        "columnId": "col-3",
        "correct": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. According to the Lund-Browder chart, the entire head of a 1-4 year old child accounts for approximately 17% of TBSA. The anterior portion (face) is half of this, which is 8.5%. The head constitutes a larger proportion of the body surface area in children compared to adults. This difference is crucial for accurate burn assessment and subsequent treatment.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Remember that the head represents a larger TBSA percentage in children than in adults. This impacts fluid resuscitation and medication dosing."

It is an underestimation for the entire anterior trunk in both children and adults. The anterior trunk encompasses a significant portion of the body and requires a larger TBSA percentage for accurate estimation.",
        "clinicalPearls": "The trunk is a large area; ensure you are using the correct TBSA percentage from the Lund-Browder chart to avoid underestimation."

        "rationale": "Correct. In the Lund-Browder chart for a child, the entire anterior trunk accounts for 13% of the TBSA. This value is different from the adult Rule of Nines, which assigns 18%. The trunk's TBSA percentage is lower in children compared to adults due to proportional differences. Accurate assessment is vital for appropriate fluid management.",

        "rationale": "Correct. For both the Lund-Browder chart and the Rule of Nines, an entire arm (from shoulder to hand) is consistently estimated as 9% of the TBSA. The arm's TBSA percentage remains relatively consistent across different age groups. This consistency simplifies the calculation process.",

Therefore, the anterior surface of one leg would be half of that, which is 6.5%. The leg's TBSA percentage is proportionally smaller in children compared to adults. This difference is crucial for accurate burn assessment and subsequent treatment.",

In a child, the legs are proportionally smaller, and the Lund-Browder chart provides a more accurate value of 6.5% for the anterior surface. Using adult values for pediatric burn assessments can lead to significant errors in fluid resuscitation and overall management.",

Underestimation can lead to hypovolemic shock, while overestimation can result in pulmonary edema.",

      "situation": "A 4-year-old male, weighing 16 kg, presented to the ED at 1400 with partial-thickness burns to the face, anterior trunk, right arm, and anterior left leg after a scalding injury.",
