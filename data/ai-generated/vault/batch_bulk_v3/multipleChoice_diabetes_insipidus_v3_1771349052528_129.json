The recent head injury is a significant risk factor for central DI due to potential damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, leading to decreased Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) secretion. The lack of ADH results in the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine, causing the hallmark signs of DI: massive polyuria (450 mL/hr) of very dilute urine (urine specific gravity of 1.002). This profound fluid loss leads to dehydration and hemoconcentration, reflected in the hypernatremia (158 mEq/L), high serum osmolality (320 mOsm/kg), tachycardia (122 bpm), and hypotension (98/58 mmHg). The lethargy can be attributed to both the head injury and the severe hypernatremia.",

In a state of simple dehydration, the body would conserve water, leading to low urine output and highly concentrated urine (urine specific gravity > 1.025). The client's extremely low urine specific gravity (1.002) indicates an inability to concentrate urine, which is the primary pathology."
