The client has a history of liver cirrhosis and takes ibuprofen daily for osteoarthritis. He presents with hematemesis, dizziness, and weakness. His skin is cool and clammy. His vital signs are: Blood Pressure 88/50 mmHg, Heart Rate 124/min, Respiratory Rate 24/min, SpO2 94% on room air. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag and drop the options from the left to the right, placing them in the correct sequence from first to last.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions prioritizes the management of hypovolemic shock, the most immediate life-threatening condition for this client. The first step is to secure vascular access with two large-bore IVs to allow for rapid administration of fluids and blood products. The second step is to immediately begin volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids to treat hypotension and improve tissue perfusion. The third step is to obtain blood for a type and crossmatch, preparing for the administration of packed red blood cells, which are essential for restoring oxygen-carrying capacity. The fourth step is to administer an IV proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) to decrease gastric acid secretion and promote clot stability, addressing the underlying cause. The final step is to notify the gastroenterologist for definitive treatment (e.g., endoscopy) once initial stabilization measures are underway.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order fails to address the life-threatening hypovolemia in a timely and effective manner. For example, administering pantoprazole or notifying the provider before establishing IV access and initiating fluid resuscitation delays critical interventions for shock and can lead to rapid deterioration and cardiovascular collapse. While all listed actions are appropriate, they must be performed in an order that prioritizes hemodynamic stability.",

The client is in hypovolemic shock, and all subsequent life-saving interventions, including fluid resuscitation, blood product administration, and IV medications, require reliable intravenous access. Using large-bore catheters (e.g., 16- or 18-gauge) is critical to allow for the rapid infusion of large volumes."

The client's hypotension (88/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (124/min) indicate significant volume loss.

An IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like pantoprazole reduces gastric acid production. This higher gastric pH promotes clot formation and stability at the bleeding site, reducing the risk of re-bleeding. This is important but secondary to immediate resuscitation."

However, it is properly performed after initial resuscitation has begun. The nurse must first stabilize the patient to ensure they can tolerate the procedure and provide the specialist with a clear clinical picture and report of interventions already performed."
