        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency. Immediate nursing actions must focus on two goals: lowering the dangerously high blood pressure and removing the noxious stimulus. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position utilizes gravity to cause orthostatic hypotension, which helps to immediately lower blood pressure. The most common cause of AD is bladder distention, so assessing for and correcting this is a top priority. Removing any tight clothing or devices eliminates other potential stimuli. If these non-pharmacological measures are not effective, the severe hypertension must be treated with a rapid-acting antihypertensive agent to prevent complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "incorrect": "Placing the client supine is contraindicated as it will further elevate blood pressure and increase the risk of a cerebrovascular event. Administering an opioid is incorrect because the headache is a symptom of the hypertensive crisis; the primary treatment is to lower the blood pressure, not mask the symptom. Addressing the cause (the hypertension) will resolve the headache.",
