    "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries above T6. The sudden onset of severe hypertension (210/110 mmHg), bradycardia (48/min), headache, diaphoresis above the level of injury, and flushing are hallmark signs. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of the injury, to which the body cannot appropriately respond due to the spinal cord lesion. The pathophysiology involves an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response. The stimulus sends signals up the spinal cord, causing widespread vasoconstriction below the level of the injury, leading to a rapid and dangerous increase in blood pressure. The body attempts to compensate by slowing the heart rate (bradycardia) via vagal stimulation, but this is often ineffective in counteracting the intense vasoconstriction. Immediate interventions aim to lower blood pressure and identify/remove the triggering stimulus. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Autonomic dysreflexia can occur years after the initial spinal cord injury. Educate clients and caregivers on recognizing the signs and symptoms and implementing preventative measures. \n\n**Prioritized Actions:**\n1.  **Elevate Head of Bed (High-Fowler's):** This is the initial action to lower blood pressure via orthostatic hypotension. \n2.  **Assess and Address Bladder Distention:** Bladder distention is the most common trigger. Check for kinks in the catheter, bladder spasms, or the need for irrigation. Catheterize if necessary, using anesthetic lubricant to minimize discomfort.\n3.  **Loosen Constrictive Clothing:** Remove any tight clothing, abdominal binders, or TED hose that could be contributing to the noxious stimulus.\n4.  **Prepare Antihypertensive Medication:** If the above measures do not rapidly reduce blood pressure, a rapid-acting antihypertensive (e.g., nifedipine, hydralazine) is required to prevent stroke, seizure, or myocardial infarction.",
    "incorrect": "Placing the client supine will worsen the hypertension and increase the risk of cerebrovascular complications. Opioid analgesics do not address the underlying cause of the headache, which is the severe hypertension. Masking the symptom without treating the cause can delay appropriate intervention and lead to serious consequences.\n\n**Incorrect Options Breakdown:**\n*   **Supine Position:** Increases cerebral blood pressure, exacerbating the hypertensive crisis.\n*   **Opioid Analgesic:** Treats the symptom (headache) but not the cause (hypertension).",
