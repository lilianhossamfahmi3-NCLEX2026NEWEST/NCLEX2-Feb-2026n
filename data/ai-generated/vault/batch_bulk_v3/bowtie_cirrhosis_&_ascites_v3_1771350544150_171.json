The client was admitted with increasing shortness of breath and a 10 lb (4.5 kg) weight gain over 3 days. The client is anxious, restless, and oriented only to person. Based on the provided clinical data, identify the condition the client is most likely experiencing, the two actions the nurse should take, and the two parameters the nurse should monitor.",
