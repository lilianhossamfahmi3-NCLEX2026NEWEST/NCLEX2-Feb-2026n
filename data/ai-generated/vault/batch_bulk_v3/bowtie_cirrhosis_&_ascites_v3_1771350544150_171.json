Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and decreased albumin synthesis. Portal hypertension increases hydrostatic pressure in abdominal capillaries, while low albumin reduces oncotic pressure. This imbalance forces fluid into the peritoneal cavity, causing ascites. The massive fluid accumulation elevates the diaphragm, impairing lung expansion and causing shortness of breath and hypoxia. Third-spacing of fluid leads to intravascular volume depletion, resulting in hypotension and compensatory tachycardia.",

The Trendelenburg position (head down, feet up) would increase the pressure of the abdominal contents against the diaphragm, severely worsening the client's respiratory distress and hypoxia.
