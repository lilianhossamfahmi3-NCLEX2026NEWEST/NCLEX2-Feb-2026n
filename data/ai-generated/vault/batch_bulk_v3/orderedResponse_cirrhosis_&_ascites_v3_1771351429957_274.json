Vital signs are: BP 155/92 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO2 91% on 2L nasal cannula. The client is anxious and states, 'I feel like I can't catch my breath.'",

        "correct": "The correct order of interventions is based on the nursing prioritization framework of Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs) followed by interventions that address the underlying pathophysiology and support ongoing management. The client's immediate need is respiratory support due to dyspnea and low oxygen saturation, caused by pressure from ascites on the diaphragm. Therefore, positioning the client to improve lung expansion is the first priority. Next, administering a rapid-acting diuretic addresses the fluid volume excess that is causing the respiratory compromise. This is followed by implementing foundational management strategies (dietary restrictions) and monitoring (I&O, weight) to prevent worsening fluid overload and track treatment effectiveness. Preparing for a paracentesis is the last step as it is a more invasive procedure that requires time for preparation and consent, while the other actions provide more immediate stabilization.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order would incorrectly prioritize interventions, potentially delaying critical support for the client's compromised respiratory status. For example, obtaining consent for a paracentesis or initiating daily weights before addressing the acute dyspnea with positioning and diuretics would fail to address the most life-threatening problem first. Similarly, implementing dietary restrictions before administering IV medication for an acute problem is an incorrect prioritization of chronic management over acute stabilization.",

The client's dyspnea, tachypnea (RR 24), and low SpO2 (91%) indicate respiratory compromise. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to lower the diaphragm, which is being pushed upward by the ascitic fluid. This increases thoracic cavity space, promotes better lung expansion, and immediately alleviates work of breathing, directly addressing the 'Breathing' component of the ABCs.",
