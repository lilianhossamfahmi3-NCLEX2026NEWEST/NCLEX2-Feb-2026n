    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and addresses the underlying pathophysiology of ascites and fluid overload. High-Fowler's position maximizes lung expansion, addressing the immediate respiratory distress. Furosemide promotes rapid diuresis, reducing fluid volume and pulmonary congestion. Fluid and sodium restrictions prevent further fluid accumulation. Strict I&O and daily weights monitor treatment effectiveness. Paracentesis is a more invasive procedure reserved for cases where other measures are insufficient or for rapid symptom relief.",

Delaying interventions that address breathing and circulation can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications.

Ascites increases intra-abdominal pressure, pushing the diaphragm upward and restricting lung expansion. High-Fowler's position uses gravity to lower the diaphragm, increasing thoracic space and improving ventilation. This directly addresses the 'Breathing' component of the ABCs.",

This reduces circulating blood volume, decreasing pulmonary congestion (crackles) and the overall fluid contributing to ascites and edema. This addresses the 'Circulation' component by reducing fluid overload and improving cardiac function. The rapid IV administration allows for quick onset of action.",
