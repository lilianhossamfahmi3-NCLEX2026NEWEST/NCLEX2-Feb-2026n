    "correct": "The most concerning trend is the cluster of findings on the afternoon of Day 3: a sudden drop in SpO2 to 88% despite oxygen therapy, a sharp increase in respiratory rate to 36/min and heart rate to 132/min, and the new onset of severe, pleuritic chest pain. This constellation of signs and symptoms strongly suggests an acute, life-threatening complication such as a pneumothorax, which is a known risk in clients with cystic fibrosis due to bleb rupture from chronic inflammation and coughing. The pathophysiology of a pneumothorax involves air entering the pleural space, disrupting the negative pressure needed for lung inflation. This leads to lung collapse, impaired gas exchange, and hypoxemia. The pleuritic chest pain arises from irritation of the parietal pleura. This represents acute respiratory decompensation requiring immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "The other options represent expected findings or less acute issues. An elevated WBC count is anticipated during a bacterial exacerbation. Increased sputum production is a therapeutic goal of airway clearance therapies. Poor appetite and fatigue are common symptoms of a systemic infection and exacerbation but do not indicate the same level of acute danger as the rapid respiratory decline.",

The subsequent downward trend on Day 2 and Day 3 indicates that the antibiotic therapy is effective. This reflects the body's inflammatory response to infection, with neutrophils being recruited to the site of infection.",

This is highly suggestive of a pneumothorax, a medical emergency requiring immediate diagnostic and therapeutic action.
