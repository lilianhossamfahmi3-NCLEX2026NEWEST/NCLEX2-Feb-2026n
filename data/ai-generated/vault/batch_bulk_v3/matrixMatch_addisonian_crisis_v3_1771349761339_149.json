This hypovolemia reduces cardiac output and tissue perfusion, potentially leading to shock. Rapid IV infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride is crucial to restore circulating volume, increase blood pressure, and improve tissue oxygenation. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of fluid overload during rapid infusion, such as crackles in the lungs or increased respiratory rate.",

Hyperkalemia disrupts the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is a cation exchange resin that binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting its excretion via the feces, thus lowering serum potassium levels. Clinical Pearl: Monitor the client for abdominal cramping or diarrhea, common side effects of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Assess ECG for changes related to hyperkalemia (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex).",

The brain relies almost exclusively on glucose for energy, and severe hypoglycemia can cause neurological dysfunction, seizures, and coma. Administering 50% dextrose IV rapidly increases blood glucose levels, providing immediate energy to the brain and preventing further neurological damage. Clinical Pearl: After administering 50% dextrose, monitor blood glucose levels frequently to prevent rebound hypoglycemia. Consider administering a continuous infusion of dextrose-containing IV fluids to maintain stable glucose levels.",

Hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that replaces the deficient cortisol, addressing the underlying hormonal imbalance. Cortisol is essential for maintaining vascular tone, regulating glucose metabolism, and modulating the body's stress response. IV hydrocortisone helps correct hypotension, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances, stabilizing the client's condition. Clinical Pearl: Administer hydrocortisone as prescribed and monitor for signs of improvement, such as increased blood pressure, improved mental status, and normalized blood glucose levels.",

These metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances lower the seizure threshold, increasing the risk of seizures. Initiating seizure precautions, such as padding the side rails and having suction equipment readily available, protects the client from injury if a seizure occurs. Clinical Pearl: Continuously assess the client's neurological status and be prepared to administer anti-seizure medications if a seizure occurs. Identify and correct the underlying causes of altered mental status, such as hypoglycemia and hyponatremia.",
