    "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. The client reports severe, boring epigastric pain radiating to the back, rated 10/10, along with nausea and vomiting. Vital signs are: T 100.8°F (38.2°C), HR 124 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, BP 94/60 mmHg, SpO2 95% on room air. The nurse has just received a set of provider orders. In which order should the nurse implement the interventions? Drag and drop the interventions into the correct order from highest to lowest priority.",

        "correct": "The correct order of interventions prioritizes hemodynamic stability, followed by acute symptom management, foundational disease-specific treatment, secondary interventions for complications, and finally, long-term health promotion. The client's hypotension (94/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (124 bpm) indicate hypovolemia from third-spacing, making fluid resuscitation the immediate priority to prevent shock (Circulation). Next, severe pain (10/10) is addressed as it causes significant physiological stress (Pain). Then, resting the pancreas by maintaining NPO status is a core treatment to reduce enzymatic activity. Gastric decompression via NG tube is indicated for persistent vomiting to prevent aspiration. Finally, education is reserved for when the client is stable and receptive.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order incorrectly prioritizes interventions. Delaying fluid resuscitation can lead to hypovolemic shock and pancreatic necrosis. Addressing pain before stabilizing circulation is incorrect, although it is a very high priority. Implementing NPO status without first addressing fluid volume deficit and severe pain does not follow the standard of care. Providing education while the client is in acute distress is ineffective and inappropriate.",

The client's hypotension (94/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (124 bpm) are clear signs of hypovolemia due to fluid shifting into the retroperitoneal space ('third-spacing'). Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is critical to restore hemodynamic stability, maintain organ perfusion (especially to the kidneys and pancreas), and prevent hypovolemic shock, a life-threatening complication."
