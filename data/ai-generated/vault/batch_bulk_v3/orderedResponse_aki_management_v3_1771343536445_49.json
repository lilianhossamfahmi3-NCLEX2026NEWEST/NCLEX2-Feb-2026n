    "correct": "The client is experiencing life-threatening complications of AKI, including severe hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L), metabolic acidosis, and fluid volume overload. The priority is to address the most immediate life-threatening condition: the risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias from hyperkalemia. The correct sequence focuses on assessing and stabilizing the cardiac membrane, rapidly lowering serum potassium, and then removing potassium and fluid from the body.\n\n1.  **Place on continuous cardiac monitor:** This is the immediate first step to assess for ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, prolonged PR interval), which can precede ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Hyperkalemia increases the resting membrane potential, making the heart more excitable and prone to arrhythmias.\n2.  **Administer IV calcium gluconate:** This is the priority intervention to stabilize the cardiac membrane and reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate does not lower serum potassium but antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the myocardium by increasing the threshold potential, making the heart less susceptible to arrhythmias. The effect lasts approximately 30-60 minutes.\n3.  **Administer IV regular insulin and 50% dextrose:** This combination provides the most rapid method to lower serum potassium by shifting it from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, promoting potassium entry into cells. Dextrose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells along with potassium. Without dextrose, severe hypoglycemia can occur.\n4.  **Prepare to administer IV furosemide:** This loop diuretic promotes the excretion of potassium and excess fluid by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased potassium excretion in the urine. However, its effectiveness is limited in an anuric client with severe AKI, and its onset of action is slower than insulin/dextrose, making it a lower priority than cardiac stabilization and potassium shifting. Furosemide also reduces preload, which can help alleviate pulmonary edema.\n5.  **Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally:** This cation-exchange resin works in the gastrointestinal tract to bind and remove potassium from the body. It exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the colon, reducing potassium absorption. It has the slowest onset of action (several hours) and is used for non-acute management, not for emergent, life-threatening hyperkalemia. It is often administered with a cathartic to promote bowel movements and potassium excretion.",

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. A potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L poses an immediate, life-threatening risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for immediate detection of ECG changes indicative of cardiotoxicity, such as peaked T waves or QRS widening, which is a critical first assessment step before intervening. Hyperkalemia affects myocardial cell repolarization, leading to characteristic ECG changes."

IV insulin facilitates the movement of potassium from the bloodstream into the cells. Dextrose is co-administered to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, driving potassium into cells. Without dextrose, severe hypoglycemia can result from insulin's action."
