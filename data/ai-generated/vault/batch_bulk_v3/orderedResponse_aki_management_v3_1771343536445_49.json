The priority is to address the most immediate life-threatening condition, which is the risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmias from hyperkalemia. The correct sequence of actions focuses on first assessing and stabilizing the cardiac membrane, then rapidly lowering serum potassium, followed by interventions to remove potassium and fluid from the body.\n\n1. **Place on continuous cardiac monitor:** This is the immediate first step to assess for ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS), which can precede ventricular fibrillation or asystole.\n2. **Administer IV calcium gluconate:** This is the priority intervention to stabilize the cardiac membrane and reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. It does not lower serum potassium but protects the heart from its effects.\n3. **Administer IV regular insulin and 50% dextrose:** This combination provides the most rapid method to lower serum potassium by shifting it from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. Dextrose is given concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia.\n4. **Prepare to administer IV furosemide:** This loop diuretic promotes the excretion of potassium and excess fluid. However, its effectiveness is limited in an anuric client with severe AKI, and its onset of action is slower than insulin/dextrose, making it a lower priority than cardiac stabilization and potassium shifting.\n5. **Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate:** This cation-exchange resin works in the gastrointestinal tract to bind and remove potassium from the body. It has the slowest onset of action and is used for non-acute management, not for emergent, life-threatening hyperkalemia.",
