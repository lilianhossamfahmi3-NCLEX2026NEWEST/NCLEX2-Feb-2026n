        "blank1": {
            "correct": "vital capacity and negative inspiratory force",
            "rationale": "Correct. In GBS, ascending paralysis affects the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to respiratory failure. Vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) are direct, objective measurements of respiratory muscle strength. A decline in these values is the most sensitive indicator of impending respiratory arrest and the need for mechanical ventilation. This is the highest priority assessment.",
            "incorrect": {
                "deep tendon reflexes in all extremities": "Incorrect. Areflexia or hyporeflexia is a hallmark diagnostic sign of GBS. While important to assess as part of the neurological exam, it does not provide information about the client's immediate life-threatening risk of respiratory failure.",
                "sensory perception to light touch and pinprick": "Incorrect. Paresthesias, numbness, and tingling are common sensory symptoms in GBS. However, the primary threat to life is motor paralysis affecting the respiratory muscles, making respiratory assessment the priority over sensory assessment.",
                "cranial nerve function (VII, IX, X)": "Incorrect. Assessing cranial nerves is important as GBS can affect facial muscles (VII) and muscles for swallowing and gagging (IX, X), increasing aspiration risk. However, direct measurement of ventilatory muscle strength (VC/NIF) is a more precise and urgent assessment for predicting imminent respiratory collapse."

        },
        "blank2": {
            "correct": "intubation and mechanical ventilation equipment at the bedside",
            "rationale": "Correct. Given the rapid and unpredictable progression of respiratory muscle paralysis in GBS, acute respiratory failure is the most significant life-threatening complication. Having intubation and ventilation equipment immediately available is a critical safety measure to ensure the airway can be secured without delay if the client's respiratory status deteriorates.",
            "incorrect": {
                "a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine": "Incorrect. A CPM machine and passive range of motion are used to prevent contractures and complications of immobility. While this is an important intervention, it is not the priority over ensuring immediate access to life-saving airway equipment.",
                "parenteral nutrition supplies": "Incorrect. Nutritional support is vital for long-term recovery, especially if dysphagia is present. However, according to airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles, ensuring a patent airway is the absolute first priority.",
                "a specialty bed for pressure injury prevention": "Incorrect. Due to paralysis, clients with GBS are at high risk for pressure injuries. A specialty mattress is an important part of the care plan, but it does not take precedence over preparedness for acute respiratory failure."
            }
        },
        "blank3": {
            "correct": "implementing continuous cardiac monitoring",
            "rationale": "Correct. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is a common and dangerous complication of GBS. It can manifest as severe bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, or profound hypotension. These cardiovascular fluctuations can occur suddenly and be life-threatening. Continuous cardiac and hemodynamic monitoring is essential for early detection and intervention.",
            "incorrect": {
                "administering prophylactic anticoagulants": "Incorrect. Due to immobility, clients are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anticoagulants are a necessary part of the plan of care. However, the risk of sudden, fatal cardiac dysrhythmia from autonomic dysfunction is more immediate and requires continuous monitoring.",
                "establishing a non-verbal communication system": "Incorrect. Communication is extremely important for the client's psychological well-being, especially if they are paralyzed or intubated. However, it does not address the physiological instability caused by autonomic dysfunction.",
                "initiating passive range of motion exercises": "Incorrect. Preventing contractures and maintaining joint mobility are important goals. However, this intervention does not address the acute, life-threatening risk of cardiovascular collapse from autonomic dysfunction."

        "blank4": {
            "correct": "remove circulating antibodies from the plasma",
            "rationale": "Correct. GBS is an autoimmune disorder where the body produces antibodies that attack the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. The primary treatments, IVIG and plasmapheresis, work to halt this autoimmune attack. Plasmapheresis physically removes the harmful antibodies from the blood. IVIG is thought to work by binding to these antibodies and providing anti-idiotypic antibodies, effectively neutralizing them. The goal is to stop further nerve damage.",
            "incorrect": {
                "reverse the demyelination of peripheral nerves": "Incorrect. These treatments do not reverse damage that has already occurred. Their purpose is to stop the ongoing autoimmune attack. The body's own Schwann cells will slowly begin the process of remyelination once the attack has been halted.",
                "stimulate the regeneration of damaged axons": "Incorrect. Axonal regeneration is a natural, slow healing process that may occur after the inflammatory process subsides. IVIG and plasmapheresis do not directly stimulate this process.",
                "suppress the production of T-lymphocytes": "Incorrect. GBS is primarily considered a humoral (antibody-mediated) autoimmune response, not a T-cell-mediated one. This is why corticosteroids, which primarily suppress T-cell activity, have not been found to be effective in treating GBS."
