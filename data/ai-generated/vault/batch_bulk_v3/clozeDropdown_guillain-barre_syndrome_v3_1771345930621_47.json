  "answerBreakdown": {
    "blank1": {
      "correct": "vital capacity and negative inspiratory force",
      "rationale": "Correct. In GBS, ascending paralysis can rapidly affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to acute respiratory failure. Vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) are objective measurements of respiratory muscle strength. A decline indicates impending respiratory arrest, necessitating mechanical ventilation. ClinicalPearl: Monitor VC/NIF q2-4 hours initially.",
      "incorrect": {
        "deep tendon reflexes in all extremities": "Incorrect. Areflexia/hyporeflexia is a GBS hallmark. While important for neurological assessment, it doesn't reflect the immediate respiratory failure risk.",
        "sensory perception to light touch and pinprick": "Incorrect. Paresthesias are common in GBS. However, motor paralysis affecting respiratory muscles poses a greater immediate threat.",
        "cranial nerve function (VII, IX, X)": "Incorrect. Assessing cranial nerves (facial/swallowing muscles) is important for aspiration risk. However, VC/NIF provides a more precise, urgent assessment of ventilatory muscle strength."
      }
    },
    "blank2": {
      "correct": "intubation and mechanical ventilation equipment at the bedside",
      "rationale": "Correct. Rapidly progressing respiratory muscle paralysis in GBS makes acute respiratory failure a critical complication. Immediate availability of intubation/ventilation equipment ensures prompt airway management if respiratory status deteriorates. ClinicalPearl: Have a crash cart readily available.",
      "incorrect": {
        "a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine": "Incorrect. CPM/ROM prevent contractures, important but secondary to airway management.",
        "parenteral nutrition supplies": "Incorrect. Nutritional support is vital, especially with dysphagia. However, airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles prioritize airway patency.",
        "a specialty bed for pressure injury prevention": "Incorrect. Pressure injury risk is high due to paralysis. A specialty bed is important but less urgent than respiratory support."
      }
    },
    "blank3": {
      "correct": "implementing continuous cardiac monitoring",
      "rationale": "Correct. Autonomic dysfunction in GBS can cause severe bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension, leading to life-threatening cardiovascular instability. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection and intervention. ClinicalPearl: Anticipate needing vasopressors or atropine.",
      "incorrect": {
        "administering prophylactic anticoagulants": "Incorrect. DVT risk is high due to immobility, requiring anticoagulants. However, the risk of fatal cardiac dysrhythmia from autonomic dysfunction is more immediate.",
        "establishing a non-verbal communication system": "Incorrect. Communication is crucial for psychological well-being, especially if paralyzed/intubated. However, it doesn't address physiological instability.",
        "initiating passive range of motion exercises": "Incorrect. Preventing contractures is important, but doesn't address the acute cardiovascular collapse risk."
      }
    },
    "blank4": {
      "correct": "remove circulating antibodies from the plasma",
      "rationale": "Correct. GBS is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack peripheral nerve myelin. IVIG and plasmapheresis aim to halt this attack. Plasmapheresis physically removes antibodies. IVIG neutralizes them by binding and providing anti-idiotypic antibodies, stopping further nerve damage. Pathophysiology: Molecular mimicry often triggers GBS. ClinicalPearl: Initiate IVIG/plasmapheresis within 2 weeks of symptom onset for best outcomes.",
      "incorrect": {
        "reverse the demyelination of peripheral nerves": "Incorrect. Treatments don't reverse existing damage; they stop the autoimmune attack. Schwann cells slowly remyelinate nerves after the attack subsides.",
        "stimulate the regeneration of damaged axons": "Incorrect. Axonal regeneration is a slow, natural healing process after inflammation subsides. IVIG/plasmapheresis don't directly stimulate it.",
        "suppress the production of T-lymphocytes": "Incorrect. GBS is primarily antibody-mediated, not T-cell-mediated. Corticosteroids (T-cell suppressors) are ineffective in GBS."
