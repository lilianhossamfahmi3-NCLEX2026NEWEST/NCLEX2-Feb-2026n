  "question": "The nurse is caring for a 52-year-old client diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) who is receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The nurse assesses the client and notes several new findings. Which finding is the highest priority for the nurse to report immediately to the healthcare provider?",
  "stem": "**Client Data**\n\n*   **Neurological:** Reports paresthesia has progressed to the wrists. Bilateral lower extremity paralysis is present. Deep tendon reflexes are 0/4 in all extremities.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, heart rate 52 bpm.\n*   **Respiratory:** Client states, \"I feel like I can't get a deep breath.\" Vital capacity is 14 mL/kg.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Client reports difficulty swallowing saliva.",

    "correct": "A vital capacity (VC) of 14 mL/kg is critically low, indicating impending respiratory failure. In GBS, ascending paralysis can affect the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, impairing the client's ability to breathe effectively. A VC below 15-20 mL/kg signifies significant respiratory muscle weakness and the urgent need for intervention to prevent respiratory arrest. Immediate preparation for elective intubation and mechanical ventilation is crucial to support oxygenation and ventilation. This finding takes priority over other concerns because respiratory failure is an immediate threat to life.",
    "incorrect": "Paresthesia progression, autonomic dysfunction (hypertension and bradycardia), and dysphagia are all complications of GBS requiring intervention, but they do not pose the same immediate life-threatening risk as severe respiratory muscle weakness. While aspiration risk from dysphagia is high, autonomic instability needs management, and disease progression is expected, maintaining a patent airway and adequate ventilation is the absolute highest priority.",
