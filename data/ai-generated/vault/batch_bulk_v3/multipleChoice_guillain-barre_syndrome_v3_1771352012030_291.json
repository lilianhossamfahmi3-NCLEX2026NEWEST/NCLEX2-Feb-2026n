The nurse assesses the client and notes several new findings. Which finding is the highest priority for the nurse to report immediately to the healthcare provider?",
    "stem": "**Client Data**\n\n*   **Neurological:** Reports paresthesia has progressed to the wrists. Bilateral lower extremity paralysis is present. Deep tendon reflexes are 0/4 in all extremities.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, heart rate 52 bpm.\n*   **Respiratory:** Client states, \"I feel like I can't get a deep breath.\" Vital capacity is 14 mL/kg.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Client reports difficulty swallowing saliva.",

        "correct": "The most critical complication of Guillain-Barre Syndrome is respiratory failure due to the ascending paralysis affecting the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. A vital capacity (VC) of less than 15-20 mL/kg is a critical indicator of impending respiratory arrest and signals the urgent need for preparation for elective intubation and mechanical ventilation. This finding supersedes all other concerns as it represents an immediate threat to life.",
        "incorrect": "While paresthesia progression, autonomic dysfunction (hypertension and bradycardia), and dysphagia are all serious complications of GBS requiring intervention, they do not pose the same immediate life-threatening risk as severe respiratory muscle weakness indicated by a critically low vital capacity. Aspiration risk from dysphagia is high, autonomic instability needs management, and disease progression is expected, but maintaining a patent airway and adequate ventilation is the absolute highest priority.",
