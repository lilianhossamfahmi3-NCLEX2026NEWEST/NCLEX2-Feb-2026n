      "rationale": "This is the first and most critical action. The client is experiencing acute hypoxemia (SpO2 85%) and a high-pressure alarm, indicating a potential ventilation issue. Disconnecting the ventilator and manually ventilating with 100% FiO2 immediately addresses the hypoxemia and allows the nurse to assess lung compliance and determine if the problem is with the client (e.g., obstruction, pneumothorax) or the ventilator itself. Manual ventilation ensures adequate oxygen delivery while troubleshooting. In ARDS, impaired gas exchange due to alveolar damage and inflammation leads to hypoxemia. High PEEP levels, while beneficial for alveolar recruitment, can also increase the risk of barotrauma and impede venous return, potentially contributing to hypotension.",

      "step": 2,
      "rationale": "After ensuring oxygenation with the bag-valve mask, the nurse should quickly investigate the most common and reversible cause of a high-pressure alarm: an airway obstruction. Attempting to pass a suction catheter can both diagnose and treat a mucus plug, which could be the source of the acute decompensation. Mucus plugs increase airway resistance, leading to increased PIP and potentially causing atelectasis and further hypoxemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Airway obstruction is a common cause of high-pressure alarms in ventilated patients. Prompt suctioning can resolve the issue and prevent further respiratory compromise. Use sterile technique during suctioning to prevent infection."

      "rationale": "Following an attempt to clear the airway, a rapid physical assessment is crucial. Auscultating for bilateral breath sounds helps to identify other life-threatening causes. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side could indicate a pneumothorax or ETT displacement into a mainstem bronchus, both of which are emergencies in a client with ARDS. Pneumothorax can occur due to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation, especially with high PEEP. ETT malposition can lead to unilateral ventilation and hypoxemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Auscultation is a critical skill for assessing ventilated patients. Changes in breath sounds can indicate serious complications such as pneumothorax or ETT malposition. Note the location and quality of breath sounds in all lung fields."

      "rationale": "Once the initial life-saving interventions (oxygenation, checking for obstruction, and rapid assessment) are complete, the nurse must activate the interprofessional team. The respiratory therapist is a key resource for ventilator and airway management, and the primary healthcare provider must be notified of the client's critical status change to direct further medical management and order necessary diagnostic tests. The respiratory therapist can assess ventilator settings and make adjustments to improve oxygenation and ventilation. The primary healthcare provider can evaluate the need for further interventions, such as bronchodilators or neuromuscular blockade.",

      "rationale": "The client's agitation is contributing to ventilator dyssynchrony, increased oxygen demand, and overall instability. After ensuring the airway is patent, oxygenation is supported, and the team has been notified, it is appropriate to manage the client's agitation with a prescribed sedative. This should not be done before ruling out and addressing the life-threatening physiological causes of the agitation (hypoxia, airway obstruction). Agitation increases metabolic demand and can worsen hypoxemia. Sedatives can reduce anxiety and promote ventilator synchrony, but they can also cause hypotension and respiratory depression.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Sedation can improve ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen demand, but it should only be administered after addressing underlying physiological causes of agitation. Monitor the client's respiratory status and blood pressure closely after administering sedatives."

Given the acute respiratory decompensation and potential for a pneumothorax or ETT malposition, a stat portable chest x-ray will almost certainly be ordered. Preparing for this in advance, after stabilizing the client and notifying the team, facilitates prompt diagnosis and treatment. A chest x-ray can confirm ETT placement, identify pneumothorax, and assess for pulmonary edema or consolidation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Anticipating diagnostic needs and preparing equipment can expedite diagnosis and treatment in critical situations. A chest x-ray is often necessary to evaluate respiratory complications. Ensure proper radiation safety precautions are followed during the chest x-ray."
