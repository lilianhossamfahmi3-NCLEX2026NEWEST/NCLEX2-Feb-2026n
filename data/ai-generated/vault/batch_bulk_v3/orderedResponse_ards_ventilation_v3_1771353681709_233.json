Disconnecting the ventilator and manually ventilating with 100% oxygen immediately addresses the hypoxemia and helps determine if the problem is with the client (e.g., obstruction, pneumothorax) or the ventilator itself. The nurse can also assess lung compliance by the feel of the bag."

After ensuring the airway is patent, oxygenation is supported, and the team has been notified, it is appropriate to manage the client's agitation with a prescribed sedative. This should not be done before ruling out and addressing the life-threatening physiological causes of the agitation (hypoxia, airway obstruction)."

Given the acute respiratory decompensation and potential for a pneumothorax or ETT malposition, a stat portable chest x-ray will almost certainly be ordered. Preparing for this in advance, after stabilizing the client and notifying the team, facilitates prompt diagnosis and treatment."
