High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are the first-line treatment as they are potent anti-inflammatory agents that can shorten the duration and severity of the relapse. The client's new-onset ataxia creates a significant fall risk, making environmental safety modifications and the use of assistive devices the most immediate priority to prevent injury. Educating the client on avoiding common triggers is crucial during an acute phase, as exposure to factors like infection, excessive heat (Uhthoff's phenomenon), or severe stress can worsen current symptoms and potentially prolong the relapse.",
        "incorrect": "Other options are incorrect because they do not address the acute priorities of the client's current situation. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are for long-term management to prevent future relapses, not to treat an active one. Baclofen and gabapentin treat specific symptoms (spasticity, pain) but are not the primary treatment for the underlying inflammation of a relapse. While rest is important for MS-related fatigue, it does not directly mitigate the immediate fall risk from ataxia as effectively as environmental changes. Intensive physical therapy is contraindicated during an acute relapse as it can worsen fatigue and symptoms. Education about DMTs, pathophysiology, or bladder management is important for long-term care but is not the most critical topic to address during the acute exacerbation when the focus is on symptom management and trigger avoidance.",
