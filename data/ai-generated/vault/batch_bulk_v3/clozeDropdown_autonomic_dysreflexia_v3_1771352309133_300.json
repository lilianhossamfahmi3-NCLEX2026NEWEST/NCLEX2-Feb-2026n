  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client with a T4 spinal cord injury. The client suddenly reports a severe, pounding headache and appears flushed and diaphoretic above the level of the injury. The vital signs are BP 208/112 mmHg, HR 46/min, and SpO2 98% on room air. The nurse recognizes these findings as consistent with autonomic dysreflexia. Complete the following sentences to outline the priority nursing actions.\n\nThe nurse's first action should be to {{blank1}}. The nurse should then immediately proceed to {{blank2}}.

    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden onset of excessively high blood pressure. It occurs in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. The most common trigger is a noxious stimulus below the level of the injury, such as bladder distention, fecal impaction, or skin irritation. The body's normal compensatory mechanisms are disrupted due to the spinal cord injury, leading to an exaggerated sympathetic response. This results in vasoconstriction below the level of the injury, causing a rapid and significant increase in blood pressure. Baroreceptors detect the hypertension and trigger a parasympathetic response above the level of the injury, resulting in bradycardia, flushing, and diaphoresis. The priority nursing actions are aimed at reducing the blood pressure and identifying/removing the triggering stimulus. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to lower blood pressure. Assessing for bladder distention and catheter patency is crucial, as bladder distention is the most common cause of AD. If these measures are ineffective, a rapid-acting antihypertensive agent is indicated to prevent severe complications such as stroke or seizure.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions can exacerbate the hypertensive crisis or delay necessary interventions. Lowering the head of the bed increases cerebral blood flow and worsens hypertension. Administering medications before addressing the underlying cause is inappropriate. While notifying the healthcare provider is important, it should not delay immediate interventions. Treating the bradycardia with atropine is contraindicated, as it will further increase blood pressure. Fecal impaction and tight clothing are potential triggers, but bladder distention is the most common and should be addressed first. Surgical decompression is not indicated for AD. Long-acting antihypertensives are not appropriate for an acute hypertensive emergency.",
