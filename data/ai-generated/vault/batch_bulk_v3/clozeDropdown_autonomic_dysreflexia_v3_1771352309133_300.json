The client suddenly reports a severe, pounding headache and appears flushed and diaphoretic above the level of the injury. The vital signs are BP 208/112 mmHg, HR 46/min, and SpO2 98% on room air. The nurse recognizes these findings as consistent with autonomic dysreflexia. Complete the following sentences to outline the priority nursing actions.\n\nThe nurse's first action should be to {{blank1}}. The nurse should then immediately proceed to {{blank2}}.

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions for managing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is to first sit the client upright (high-Fowler's position) to induce orthostatic hypotension and lower the blood pressure. The second step is to promptly identify and remove the noxious stimulus. Bladder distention is the most common cause (approximately 85% of cases), so assessing the bladder and urinary catheter is the priority. If these initial non-pharmacological interventions fail to resolve the severe hypertension, a rapid-acting antihypertensive agent is administered to prevent complications such as stroke, seizure, or myocardial infarction.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect sequences either delay life-saving interventions, worsen the condition, or address secondary symptoms instead of the root cause. Laying the client flat will exacerbate hypertension. Administering medication before attempting to remove the stimulus is not the primary intervention. Checking for impaction or loosening clothing are valid actions but are secondary to checking the bladder, which is the most common trigger. Treating the compensatory bradycardia with atropine is contraindicated as it would eliminate the body's reflex to slow the heart in response to extreme hypertension, potentially leading to a catastrophic rise in blood pressure.",
