The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 55, which is severely compromised (severe ARDS is <100). The plateau pressure of 32 cm H2O indicates decreasing lung compliance and risk for barotrauma. In this situation, standard ventilation adjustments are failing. Initiating prone positioning is the most appropriate, evidence-based intervention. Proning improves ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching by recruiting dependent, atelectatic alveoli in the dorsal lung regions and shifting perfusion away from edematous areas, thereby improving oxygenation. Following this intervention, it is critical to monitor for both therapeutic effects and potential complications. ABG results are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of proning on gas exchange (specifically PaO2). Hemodynamic stability must be closely monitored, as the physical act of turning the client can cause significant shifts in blood pressure and cardiac output.",
        "incorrect": "Increasing PEEP further is risky as the plateau pressure is already high (32 cm H2O), increasing the risk of barotrauma without guaranteed benefit. Administering a fluid bolus would likely worsen the pulmonary edema characteristic of ARDS. Increasing the tidal volume is contraindicated in ARDS, as a low tidal volume strategy (6 mL/kg ideal body weight) is lung-protective and reduces mortality. While inhaled nitric oxide is a rescue therapy, prone positioning is typically trialed first as a more accessible and often highly effective intervention. Monitoring urine output, temperature, or pupillary response are part of general ICU care but are not the most direct parameters to assess the immediate effects and risks of prone positioning.",
