The client reports a 'worsening cough' over the past week, producing thicker, yellow-green sputum. He also reports increased fatigue and a poor appetite. He states he has been 'forgetting' to do his airway clearance therapy (ACT) before school. The nurse completes an assessment and notes the following findings.",

According to the principles of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), addressing inadequate oxygenation is the immediate priority to prevent further decompensation. Administering supplemental oxygen will help correct the hypoxemia, reduce the work of breathing, and stabilize the client's physiological status.",

However, it is a diagnostic action that can be performed after addressing the client's immediate physiological need for oxygen. Stabilizing breathing and circulation always takes precedence over diagnostic procedures."

Patient education is not the priority when the client is in active respiratory distress. The focus must first be on stabilizing their acute condition. Education will be more effective once the client is stable."

Consulting the dietitian is an important part of the multidisciplinary care plan. However, this is not an immediate life-threatening issue compared to hypoxemia. Nutritional interventions can be planned after the client's respiratory status is stabilized."
