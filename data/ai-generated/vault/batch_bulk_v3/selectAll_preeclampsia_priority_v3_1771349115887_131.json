    "scenario": "A nurse is caring for a 36-year-old client at 34 weeks gestation who was admitted for management of preeclampsia. The client's vital signs are: blood pressure 168/112 mmHg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 37.1° C (98.8° F). The client reports a persistent headache and seeing 'spots'. The nurse assesses +4 deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) with 2 beats of clonus. The healthcare provider has been notified and new orders have been received.",

            "rationale": "Correct. The client's clinical presentation, including a severe range blood pressure, headache, visual disturbances, and hyperreflexia (+4 DTRs with clonus), indicates significant central nervous system (CNS) irritability and an imminent risk of an eclamptic seizure. Initiating seizure precautions (e.g., padding side rails, ensuring suction and oxygen are at the bedside) is a critical safety priority.",

        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Correct. Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant medication of choice for seizure prophylaxis in clients with preeclampsia with severe features. Given the signs of CNS irritability, immediate administration of the prescribed loading dose followed by a maintenance infusion is a priority to prevent eclampsia.",

            "optionId": "opt_3",

            "rationale": "Incorrect. Ambulation is contraindicated for a client with preeclampsia with severe features. Strict bed rest is prescribed to decrease blood pressure, reduce CNS stimulation, and promote uteroplacental perfusion. Ambulation could increase blood pressure and the risk of a fall or seizure.",

IV fluids should be administered cautiously and are often restricted (e.g., 100-125 mL/hr total). Increasing the rate to 200 mL/hr could lead to fluid overload and respiratory compromise.",

            "rationale": "Correct. The definitive cure for preeclampsia is the delivery of the fetus and placenta. As the client's condition is worsening and showing signs of severe features, delivery is likely imminent. The nurse must anticipate and prepare for this, which may involve an emergency cesarean section.",

            "optionId": "opt_7",
            "rationale": "Correct. An indwelling urinary catheter is essential for the client receiving magnesium sulfate and experiencing severe preeclampsia. It allows for strict, accurate monitoring of urine output, which is a critical indicator of renal perfusion and an early sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity (oliguria < 30 mL/hr).",
