  "scenario": "A nurse is caring for a 36-year-old client at 34 weeks gestation who was admitted for management of preeclampsia. At 1400, the client's vital signs are: blood pressure 168/112 mmHg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 37.1° C (98.8° F). The client reports a persistent headache and seeing 'spots'. The nurse assesses +4 deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) with 2 beats of clonus. The healthcare provider has been notified and new orders have been received.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "rationale": "Correct. The client exhibits signs of severe preeclampsia, including elevated blood pressure, headache, visual disturbances (seeing 'spots'), and hyperreflexia (+4 DTRs with clonus). These findings indicate significant central nervous system (CNS) irritability, increasing the risk of eclampsia (seizures). Initiating seizure precautions, such as padding side rails, ensuring readily available suction and oxygen, and having emergency medications at the bedside, is crucial to protect the client from injury during a potential seizure. Clinical Pearl: Eclampsia is a life-threatening complication of preeclampsia characterized by seizures. Prompt intervention is essential to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "rationale": "Correct. Magnesium sulfate is the primary medication used to prevent and treat seizures in preeclampsia. It acts as a CNS depressant, reducing neuronal excitability and preventing seizures. The client's symptoms warrant immediate administration of a magnesium sulfate loading dose, followed by a maintenance infusion, as prescribed. Monitor for magnesium toxicity (decreased respiratory rate, absent DTRs, altered level of consciousness). Clinical Pearl: Therapeutic magnesium levels are typically 4-7 mEq/L. Monitor serum magnesium levels regularly to ensure therapeutic range and prevent toxicity.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_3",
      "rationale": "Correct. Reducing environmental stimuli is essential to minimize CNS irritability and decrease the risk of seizures. Darkening the room, limiting visitors, and minimizing noise can help prevent overstimulation and reduce the likelihood of seizure activity. This creates a calming environment conducive to reducing CNS excitability. Clinical Pearl: Cluster nursing care to minimize disturbances and allow for periods of rest.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_4",
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Ambulation is contraindicated in clients with severe preeclampsia. Bed rest is recommended to reduce blood pressure and minimize the risk of falls or other complications. Increased activity can elevate blood pressure and potentially trigger a seizure. Furthermore, ambulation may compromise uteroplacental perfusion. Clinical Pearl: Strict bed rest promotes maternal stability and fetal well-being in severe preeclampsia.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_5",
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Clients with severe preeclampsia are at risk for pulmonary edema due to endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability. Excessive IV fluid administration can exacerbate this risk, leading to fluid overload and respiratory compromise. IV fluid administration should be carefully monitored and typically restricted to a maintenance rate (e.g., 100-125 mL/hr) unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of pulmonary edema, such as dyspnea, crackles, and decreased oxygen saturation.",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_6",
      "rationale": "Correct. Preeclampsia is a progressive condition, and the definitive treatment is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Given the client's severe symptoms and gestational age (34 weeks), delivery is likely to be considered if the client's condition does not stabilize or worsens. Preparing for potential emergency delivery, including notifying the operating room and neonatal team, is a priority. Clinical Pearl: Delivery decisions are based on maternal and fetal status, gestational age, and response to medical management.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_7",
      "rationale": "Correct. An indwelling urinary catheter is necessary for accurate monitoring of urine output, which is a critical indicator of renal perfusion and overall fluid balance. Magnesium sulfate is excreted renally, and decreased urine output (<30 mL/hr) may indicate magnesium toxicity. Strict monitoring of urine output is essential to prevent complications. Clinical Pearl: Report oliguria (<30 mL/hr) to the healthcare provider immediately, as it may indicate renal dysfunction or magnesium toxicity. "
