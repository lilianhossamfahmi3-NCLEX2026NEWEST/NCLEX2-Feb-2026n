        "rationale": "The client's clinical presentation, including hypotension (94/58 mmHg), tachycardia (118/min), high serum sodium (152 mEq/L), and massive urine output (800 mL in 2 hours), indicates severe dehydration and developing hypovolemic shock secondary to central diabetes insipidus. The priority action, based on the principle of Airway-Breathing-Circulation (ABC), is to stabilize the client's circulatory status. An isotonic IV fluid bolus will rapidly expand intravascular volume, improving blood pressure and tissue perfusion, which is the most critical life-saving intervention at this moment.",
        "optionRationales": {
            "opt_1": "Correct. The client is hemodynamically unstable, evidenced by hypotension and tachycardia. This signifies a critical fluid volume deficit (hypovolemia). The immediate priority is to restore circulating volume with an isotonic IV fluid bolus to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
            "opt_2": "Incorrect. While desmopressin is the definitive treatment for central diabetes insipidus as it replaces antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and will decrease urine output, it does not correct the existing severe fluid deficit as rapidly as an IV bolus. Hemodynamic stabilization must occur first.",
            "opt_3": "Incorrect. The client's hypernatremia (152 mEq/L) and confusion do place them at risk for seizures, and implementing seizure precautions is a necessary intervention. However, it does not address the life-threatening hemodynamic instability, making it a secondary priority to fluid resuscitation.",
            "opt_4": "Incorrect. The client is lethargic and confused, which increases the risk of aspiration. Furthermore, oral rehydration is insufficient to correct the profound and rapid fluid loss seen in this acute phase of diabetes insipidus. Intravenous fluid replacement is required."
