The client returned from an 18-hour international flight two days ago. Her medical history includes the use of oral contraceptives.\n\n**Provider's Orders:**\n*   CT angiogram of the chest\n*   D-dimer, CBC, aPTT, PT/INR\n*   Oxygen 2 L via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%\n*   Initiate continuous intravenous heparin infusion per protocol for confirmed pulmonary embolism.\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n*   Vital Signs: T 99.6°F (37.6°C), HR 122, RR 26, BP 104/66, SpO2 90% on room air.\n*   Respiratory: Anxious, tachypneic, lung sounds clear but diminished in the right lower lobe.\n*   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic with S1, S2 audible.\n*   Extremities: 2+ pitting edema and tenderness in the right calf.\n\nThe CT angiogram confirms a segmental pulmonary embolism. The nurse prepares to initiate the heparin infusion protocol. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

It is essential to obtain baseline laboratory values, including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, before starting heparin.

                "rationale": "Correct. Heparin protocols for acute pulmonary embolism typically begin with an intravenous bolus (loading dose) to quickly achieve a therapeutic level of anticoagulation. This is followed by a continuous infusion that is titrated based on aPTT levels."

Active or passive exercises of the affected limb could potentially dislodge the existing thrombus, leading to further embolization. The client should be on bed rest initially."

Institutional policies universally require an independent double-check by two licensed nurses for the setup and rate changes of heparin infusions to prevent medication errors. Expediting treatment should not compromise client safety."

These include using a soft-bristled toothbrush, an electric razor, avoiding IM injections, and monitoring for signs of bleeding like bruising, petechiae, or hematuria."
