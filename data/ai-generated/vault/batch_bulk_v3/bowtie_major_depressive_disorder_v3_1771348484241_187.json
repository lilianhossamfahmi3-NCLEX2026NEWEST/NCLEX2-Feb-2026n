        "correct": "The client's presentation of flat affect, anergia ('no energy'), anhedonia (lack of interest), poor appetite, and social withdrawal are classic symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The statement 'They would be better off without...me. I'm just a burden,' represents a key warning sign of suicidal ideation (hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness). Therefore, the priority is to directly assess for suicide risk and implement safety precautions. The most critical action is to ask the client directly about thoughts of self-harm to assess intent. Concurrently, implementing one-to-one observation is essential to ensure immediate safety. Monitoring should focus on the core psychological and functional deficits of MDD: tracking verbalizations of hopelessness assesses suicidal ideation and mood, while monitoring participation in self-care evaluates improvement in anergia and psychomotor retardation.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices fail to prioritize the client's immediate safety or focus on less critical aspects of care. A grief reaction is less likely given the severity and specific cognitive distortions (burdensomeness). Delirium is ruled out by the client's orientation. While a dietary consult and monitoring caloric intake are important, they are secondary to suicide risk. Group therapy is inappropriate for an acutely withdrawn and potentially suicidal client. Administering lorazepam treats anxiety, not the underlying depression or suicide risk. Monitoring serum sodium is irrelevant without evidence of a specific cause like SIADH. Monitoring family visits does not directly assess the client's clinical status.",
