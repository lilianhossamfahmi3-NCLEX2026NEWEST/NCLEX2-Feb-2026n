    "stem": "The nurse is caring for a 78-year-old male client with small cell lung cancer who was admitted for management of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). The client's latest serum sodium level is 118 mEq/L (118 mmol/L). The client has become increasingly lethargic and confused over the past two hours. The healthcare provider has been notified and has prescribed new interventions. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Na+ < 120 mEq/L with neurological changes). The priority treatment is the slow infusion of a hypertonic saline solution, such as 3% sodium chloride, to increase the serum sodium concentration and reduce cerebral edema. Using an infusion pump is critical to ensure a controlled rate and prevent rapid correction, which could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Encouraging fluid intake is contraindicated in SIADH. The pathophysiology of SIADH involves excessive water reabsorption, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. Increasing fluid intake would worsen the fluid overload, further dilute the serum sodium, and exacerbate cerebral edema and neurological symptoms."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Severe hyponatremia causes cerebral edema, which irritates brain tissue and significantly increases the risk of seizures. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, ensuring suction and oxygen are at the bedside, maintaining a safe environment) is a critical safety measure for this client."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering 0.9% sodium chloride, an isotonic solution, would not effectively raise the serum sodium in a client with SIADH and could potentially worsen the condition if it contributes to fluid overload without significantly changing serum osmolality. A bolus administration is also dangerous as it can cause rapid fluid shifts and does not allow for controlled correction of sodium levels."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Fluid restriction is a cornerstone of management for SIADH. Limiting fluid intake to less than urine output (e.g., 800-1000 mL/day) helps prevent further dilution of serum sodium and allows for a gradual increase in sodium concentration as excess water is excreted."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., monitoring level of consciousness, orientation, Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary response) are essential to evaluate the client's response to treatment and to detect early signs of clinical improvement or deterioration. This monitoring is also crucial for identifying potential complications such as worsening cerebral edema or the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome from overly rapid sodium correction."
