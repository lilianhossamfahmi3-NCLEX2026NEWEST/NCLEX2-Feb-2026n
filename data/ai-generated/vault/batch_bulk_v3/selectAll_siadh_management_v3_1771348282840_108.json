  "stem": "The nurse is caring for a 78-year-old male client with small cell lung cancer admitted for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) management. His latest serum sodium is 118 mEq/L (118 mmol/L). Over the past two hours, he has become increasingly lethargic and confused. The healthcare provider was notified and prescribed new interventions. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client exhibits severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Na+ < 120 mEq/L) with neurological changes, indicating cerebral edema. The priority is a slow infusion of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) to increase serum sodium and reduce cerebral edema. An infusion pump ensures a controlled rate, preventing rapid correction and the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). ODS occurs when rapid sodium correction causes fluid shifts, damaging the myelin sheath of nerve cells, particularly in the pons. Monitor sodium levels q2-4 hours during infusion. Clinical Pearl: Rapid correction of hyponatremia can be more dangerous than the hyponatremia itself.",
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Encouraging fluid intake is contraindicated in SIADH. SIADH involves excessive ADH secretion, leading to increased water reabsorption in the kidneys and dilutional hyponatremia. Increased fluid intake worsens fluid overload, further diluting serum sodium and exacerbating cerebral edema. The kidneys are already retaining too much fluid due to the effects of ADH. Clinical Pearl: Fluid restriction is a key intervention in SIADH to allow the body to excrete excess water and increase serum sodium.",
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Severe hyponatremia causes cerebral edema, increasing the risk of seizures due to neuronal excitability. Implementing seizure precautions (padded side rails, suction and oxygen at bedside, safe environment) is crucial. Cerebral edema increases intracranial pressure, irritating brain tissue and lowering the seizure threshold. Clinical Pearl: Hyponatremia-induced seizures can be life-threatening; prioritize patient safety.",
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering 0.9% sodium chloride (isotonic) is ineffective in raising serum sodium in SIADH and can worsen the condition by contributing to fluid overload without significantly changing serum osmolality. A bolus is dangerous, causing rapid fluid shifts and uncontrolled sodium correction. Isotonic solutions primarily expand the extracellular fluid volume, which is already excessive in SIADH. Clinical Pearl: Isotonic solutions will not effectively treat the underlying sodium deficit in SIADH and can exacerbate fluid overload.",
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Fluid restriction is a cornerstone of SIADH management. Limiting fluid intake to less than urine output (e.g., 800 mL/24 hours) prevents further dilution of serum sodium, allowing a gradual increase as excess water is excreted. This reduces the workload on the kidneys and helps to restore fluid balance. Monitor urine output closely. Clinical Pearl: Strict adherence to fluid restriction is essential for effective SIADH management.",
      "scoringWeight": "1"
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurological assessments (level of consciousness, orientation, Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary response) are essential to evaluate treatment response and detect early signs of improvement or deterioration. This monitoring identifies complications like worsening cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) from overly rapid sodium correction. Changes in mental status are early indicators of sodium imbalances. Clinical Pearl: Neurological status is a sensitive indicator of treatment effectiveness and potential complications in SIADH.",

      "Situation": "78-year-old male with small cell lung cancer admitted for SIADH management. Serum sodium is 118 mEq/L. Client is increasingly lethargic and confused.",
      "Background": "Client has a history of small cell lung cancer, which is known to cause SIADH. Admitted for hyponatremia management. Current sodium level is critically low.",
      "Assessment": "Client's lethargy and confusion indicate worsening hyponatremia and potential cerebral edema. Sodium level is 118 mEq/L. Neurological status is declining.",
      "Recommendation": "Initiate 3% sodium chloride infusion via pump, implement seizure precautions, restrict fluids to 800 mL/24 hours, and perform frequent neurological assessments every 1-2 hours. Monitor serum sodium levels every 2-4 hours."
