        "cue": "Blood Pressure: 168/112 mmHg",
        "significance": "Indicates severe hypertension, a hallmark of preeclampsia with severe features, increasing the risk for stroke and placental abruption.  Sustained hypertension damages endothelial cells, leading to vasospasm and further blood pressure elevation.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Monitor BP closely; uncontrolled hypertension can lead to end-organ damage."
      },
      {
        "cue": "Reports severe frontal headache and 'blurry' vision.",
        "significance": "These are signs of cerebral irritation and vasospasm, indicating severe central nervous system (CNS) involvement and are premonitory signs of an impending eclamptic seizure.  Cerebral edema and reduced cerebral blood flow contribute to these neurological symptoms.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Report any visual disturbances or severe headaches immediately; these are red flags for worsening preeclampsia."
      },
      {
        "cue": "DTRs 3+ bilaterally with 2 beats of clonus.",
        "significance": "Hyperreflexia and clonus are classic signs of increased CNS irritability and neuromuscular excitability, further heightening the risk of an eclamptic seizure.  Magnesium sulfate works by depressing the CNS, thus preventing seizures.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Assess DTRs frequently; changes indicate magnesium toxicity or worsening preeclampsia."
      },
      {
        "cue": "Magnesium sulfate... for worsening preeclampsia or signs of CNS irritability.",
        "significance": "A provider's order already exists to address this exact clinical situation, allowing the nurse to act promptly. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for preventing seizures in preeclampsia.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Know the signs of magnesium toxicity (decreased DTRs, respiratory depression) and have calcium gluconate available."

    "rationales": [
      {
        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "justification": "Correct. The client is exhibiting clear signs of CNS irritability (severe headache, hyperreflexia, clonus), which are indications for initiating magnesium sulfate. This medication is a CNS depressant used for seizure prophylaxis in clients with severe preeclampsia. The provider's orders support this immediate action. Magnesium sulfate prevents seizures by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing CNS excitability.",
        "evaluation": "This is a priority action to prevent an eclamptic seizure, a life-threatening complication. +"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "justification": "Incorrect. While delivery is the ultimate cure for preeclampsia and may be imminent, it is not the nurse's immediate, independent action. The client must first be stabilized (e.g., with magnesium sulfate and antihypertensives) to ensure maternal and fetal safety during the delivery process. The nurse's role is to anticipate and prepare for delivery after implementing initial safety measures and notifying the provider. Delivery is considered when maternal or fetal status deteriorates despite treatment.",
        "evaluation": "This action is anticipatory but not the most immediate nursing priority; stabilization comes first. -"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "justification": "Incorrect. Encouraging oral fluids is not a priority and could be dangerous if the client has a seizure and aspirates. Furthermore, clients with severe preeclampsia are at risk for pulmonary edema due to capillary leakage and may be on a fluid restriction. Preeclampsia causes endothelial damage, leading to increased capillary permeability and fluid shifts into the interstitial space.",
        "evaluation": "This action is unsafe and not indicated for the client's condition. -"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "justification": "Correct. Placing the client in a left lateral position is a priority intervention. This position maximizes uterine and placental perfusion by displacing the gravid uterus off the vena cava and aorta, which can improve blood flow to the fetus and help lower maternal blood pressure. Compression of the vena cava can reduce venous return and cardiac output, leading to decreased placental perfusion.",
        "evaluation": "This is a simple, non-invasive, and effective nursing action to improve maternal and fetal circulation. +"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "justification": "Correct. The client's condition represents a significant deterioration and progression to preeclampsia with severe features. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate collaboration with the healthcare provider to manage blood pressure, prevent seizures, and plan for likely delivery. Prompt communication ensures timely interventions and optimal outcomes.",
        "evaluation": "This is a critical communication and safety action that must be performed immediately. +"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_6",
        "justification": "Incorrect. While the client is nauseous, the nausea is a symptom of cerebral irritation, not a primary gastrointestinal issue. The priority is to treat the underlying cause (the severe preeclampsia) with magnesium sulfate, not to mask the symptom with an antiemetic. Addressing the CNS irritability will likely resolve the nausea. Nausea in preeclampsia is often related to increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema.",
        "evaluation": "This action addresses a symptom but not the life-threatening root cause, thus delaying critical care. -"
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_7",
        "justification": "Correct. The client's signs of severe CNS irritability (headache, clonus) indicate a high risk for an imminent eclamptic seizure. Ensuring seizure precautions are in place, which includes having functional suction equipment and oxygen available at the bedside, is a critical safety measure to manage the airway in the event of a seizure. During a seizure, the client is at high risk for aspiration and hypoxia.",
        "evaluation": "This is a crucial safety and preparedness action to protect the client from seizure-related complications. +"
