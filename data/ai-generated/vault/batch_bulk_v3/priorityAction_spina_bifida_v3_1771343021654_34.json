        "correct": "The most immediate priority for an infant with a myelomeningocele is to protect the exposed sac from injury, rupture, and infection. The thin membrane can easily dry out or tear, which would damage the delicate neural tissue and create a direct portal of entry for microorganisms into the central nervous system, leading to potentially fatal meningitis. Applying a sterile, warm saline-soaked, non-adherent dressing keeps the sac moist, prevents tissue damage from drying, and provides a sterile barrier against infection. Using warm saline also helps prevent hypothermia in the newborn.",
        "incorrect": "While all other options are important components of care for this infant, they are not the most immediate priority. Positioning, baseline neuro assessments, and monitoring for hydrocephalus are all crucial but must be performed after the sac is protected from immediate, irreversible harm. Delaying the application of a protective dressing, even for a few minutes to perform these other tasks, significantly increases the risk of sac rupture and central nervous system infection.",
