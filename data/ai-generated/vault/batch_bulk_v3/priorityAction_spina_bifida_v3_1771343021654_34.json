    "correct": "The immediate priority (0030) is to protect the myelomeningocele sac from injury and infection. The thin membrane is prone to rupture, leading to CNS infection (meningitis). A sterile, warm saline-soaked non-adherent dressing maintains moisture, preventing desiccation and tissue breakdown. Saline helps prevent hypothermia. This action minimizes the risk of ascending infection and further neurological damage. ClinicalPearl: Drying of the sac can lead to rapid deterioration of the neural tissue. Failure to protect the sac can result in life-threatening complications.",
    "incorrect": "While other options are important, they are secondary to protecting the sac. Positioning, neurological assessments, and monitoring for hydrocephalus are crucial but performed after sac protection. Delaying sac protection increases the risk of rupture and CNS infection. A: Head circumference monitors for hydrocephalus, a later concern. B: Neurological assessment establishes a baseline but doesn't address the immediate risk of infection. D: Prone positioning is important but the sac must be protected first to prevent contamination and drying. ClinicalPearl: Prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and immediate threats to patient safety.",
