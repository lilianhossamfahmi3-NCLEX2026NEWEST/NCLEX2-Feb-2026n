      "option": "Client report of a recent bout of gastroenteritis with diarrhea.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** Gastroenteritis with diarrhea leads to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, particularly sodium depletion. Lithium is a salt and is reabsorbed in the kidneys similarly to sodium. When sodium levels are low, the kidneys compensate by increasing lithium reabsorption, leading to elevated lithium levels in the blood and increasing the risk of toxicity. This is because lithium's therapeutic window is narrow, and even small changes in serum concentration can have significant effects. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Diarrhea causes fluid and electrolyte loss, decreasing extracellular fluid volume. The body activates compensatory mechanisms, including increased sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. Lithium, being an ion similar to sodium, is also reabsorbed, leading to increased serum lithium levels.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in patients taking lithium, especially during episodes of gastrointestinal illness. Educate patients to hold their lithium dose and seek medical advice if they experience significant diarrhea or vomiting.",

      "option": "Client reports maintaining a 2-liter daily fluid intake.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** Maintaining adequate hydration (2-3 liters daily) is a crucial preventative measure against lithium toxicity. Lithium is excreted by the kidneys, and adequate fluid intake helps facilitate this excretion, preventing the drug from accumulating to toxic levels. This finding indicates a positive health maintenance behavior, not a sign of toxicity.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Adequate fluid intake supports renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), promoting efficient lithium clearance. Dehydration reduces GFR, leading to lithium retention.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Reinforce the importance of consistent fluid intake with patients on lithium therapy, especially during periods of increased activity or hot weather.",

    {
      "option": "Initiation of lisinopril two weeks ago.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can increase the risk of lithium toxicity. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone production. Aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. When aldosterone is reduced, more sodium is excreted, leading to increased lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules as the kidneys attempt to maintain sodium balance. This results in elevated serum lithium levels.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II, leading to decreased aldosterone. Reduced aldosterone causes increased sodium excretion and compensatory lithium reabsorption in the kidneys.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor lithium levels closely when starting or adjusting ACE inhibitor dosages in patients taking lithium. Be vigilant for signs of lithium toxicity and educate patients about the potential interaction.",

      "option": "Fine hand tremors noted during assessment.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** Fine hand tremors are a common side effect of lithium, even at therapeutic levels. However, worsening tremors or the new onset of tremors can be an early sign of lithium toxicity. It's important to differentiate between a mild, stable tremor and a new or worsening tremor, as the latter suggests rising lithium levels.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Lithium affects neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including dopamine and GABA. These effects can manifest as tremors. Increased lithium levels exacerbate these effects, leading to more pronounced tremors.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Assess the characteristics of the tremor (frequency, amplitude, impact on function) and compare it to previous assessments. Report any changes to the healthcare provider.",

    {
      "option": "Blood pressure of 134/86 mmHg.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** A blood pressure of 134/86 mmHg indicates Stage 1 hypertension. While hypertension is a comorbidity for this client, it is not directly indicative of lithium toxicity. It is important to manage the client's hypertension, but this finding does not suggest elevated lithium levels.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Hypertension is a multifactorial condition involving increased peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, or both. It is not directly related to lithium's mechanism of action or toxicity.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Continue to monitor and manage the client's hypertension according to established guidelines, but do not confuse it with signs of lithium toxicity.",

    {
      "option": "Client states, \"My vision seems a bit blurry today.\"",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "**Rationale:** Blurred vision is a neurological symptom that can indicate lithium toxicity. Lithium can affect the central nervous system (CNS), and visual disturbances are a sign of neurotoxicity. This symptom warrants immediate investigation to rule out elevated lithium levels.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Lithium can disrupt neuronal function and neurotransmitter balance in the CNS, leading to various neurological symptoms, including blurred vision, dizziness, and confusion. The exact mechanism is not fully understood but involves interference with ion transport and neurotransmitter signaling.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Any new or worsening neurological symptoms in a patient taking lithium should be promptly evaluated to rule out toxicity.",
