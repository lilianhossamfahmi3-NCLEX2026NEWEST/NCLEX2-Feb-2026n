    "question": "The nurse is assessing a 52-year-old client in an outpatient mental health clinic. The client has a history of bipolar I disorder and hypertension. The client has been taking lithium for several years. Which of the following findings should the nurse identify as concerning for potential lithium toxicity? Select all that apply.",
    "options": [
        "Client report of a recent bout of gastroenteritis with diarrhea.",
        "Client reports maintaining a 2-liter daily fluid intake.",
        "Initiation of lisinopril two weeks ago.",
        "Fine hand tremors noted during assessment.",
        "Blood pressure of 134/86 mmHg.",
        "Client states, \"My vision seems a bit blurry today.\""

            "option": "Fine hand tremors noted during assessment.",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: While fine hand tremors can be a common side effect of lithium at therapeutic levels, they are also an early sign of toxicity. Worsening tremors or the new onset of tremors should be investigated as a potential indicator of rising lithium levels."
        },
        {
            "option": "Client report of a recent bout of gastroenteritis with diarrhea.",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Lithium is cleared by the kidneys. Conditions that cause dehydration and sodium depletion, such as diarrhea from gastroenteritis, can significantly decrease lithium clearance. This leads to an accumulation of the drug in the bloodstream, increasing the risk for toxicity."
        },
        {
            "option": "Initiation of lisinopril two weeks ago.",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of lithium toxicity by increasing sodium excretion, which in turn leads to increased reabsorption of lithium in the renal tubules. The initiation of this medication is a significant risk factor."
        },
        {
            "option": "Client states, \"My vision seems a bit blurry today.\"",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Blurred vision is a sign of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity associated with elevated lithium levels. This neurotoxic effect is a concerning cue that requires immediate follow-up."
        },
        {
            "option": "Blood pressure of 134/86 mmHg.",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This blood pressure reading indicates Stage 1 hypertension, which is an expected finding given the client's medical history and the reason for the lisinopril prescription. It is not a direct sign of lithium toxicity."
        },
        {
            "option": "Client reports maintaining a 2-liter daily fluid intake.",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Maintaining an adequate fluid intake of 2-3 liters per day and a consistent sodium intake are crucial health maintenance behaviors to prevent lithium toxicity. This finding is a positive self-care action, not a concerning cue for current toxicity."
