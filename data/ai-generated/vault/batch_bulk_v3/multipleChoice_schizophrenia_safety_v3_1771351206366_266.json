The client is pacing, shouting, \"The voices are telling me I have to hurt myself before they get me!\" and is clenching and unclenching their fists. The client is making poor eye contact and is not responding to questions. What is the nurse's priority action?",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority action is client safety. The client's command hallucinations and agitation indicate a high risk of self-harm. A low-stimulus environment reduces sensory overload, decreasing agitation. One-on-one observation is crucial to prevent acting on hallucinations. This approach is the least restrictive, most immediate safety intervention. The pathophysiology behind this is that acute psychosis disrupts normal thought processes and impulse control. Command hallucinations can override rational thinking, leading to dangerous behaviors. A calm environment helps regulate the client's nervous system, reducing the intensity of the psychotic symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "While medication, therapeutic communication, and reality orientation are components of schizophrenia care, they aren't the immediate priority when a client poses a safety risk. Arguing with delusions or exploring hallucinations during peak agitation can escalate the situation. Medication requires a provider order and preparation time, leaving the client unsafe. The nurse's first responsibility is a safe environment. Attempting reality orientation during acute psychosis can increase anxiety and agitation, as the client's perception of reality is significantly altered. The delay in obtaining medication orders prolongs the client's exposure to the risk of self-harm.",

The client's command hallucinations for self-harm and severe agitation represent an immediate safety risk.
