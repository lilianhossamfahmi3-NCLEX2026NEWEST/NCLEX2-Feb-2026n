The client is pacing, shouting, \"The voices are telling me I have to hurt myself before they get me!\" and is clenching and unclenching their fists. The client is making poor eye contact and is not responding to questions. What is the nurse's priority action?",
    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The priority action is to ensure the safety of the client and others. The client is experiencing command hallucinations for self-harm and is highly agitated, indicating a high risk for violence. Placing the client in a low-stimulus environment helps to decrease agitation, and one-on-one observation is essential to prevent the client from acting on the command hallucinations. This is the least restrictive, most immediate safety intervention.",
        "incorrect": "While medication, therapeutic communication, and reality orientation are all components of care for schizophrenia, they are not the immediate priority when a client poses a significant safety risk. Arguing with a delusion or exploring hallucinations during peak agitation can escalate the situation. Medication administration requires a provider order and time to prepare, during which the client remains in an unsafe state. The nurse's first responsibility is to establish a safe environment.",

The client's command hallucinations for self-harm and severe agitation represent an immediate safety risk. Moving the client to a quiet environment reduces sensory input that can exacerbate psychosis, and providing constant one-on-one observation is the most immediate and effective intervention to prevent self-injury.",
