This causes dilutional hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolality, and concentrated urine. In small cell lung cancer, tumor cells can ectopically produce ADH. Demeclocycline inhibits ADH's effect on the renal tubules, promoting water excretion. Fluid restriction limits water intake to prevent further dilution. Improvement in serum sodium and osmolality, along with decreased urine specific gravity and improved neurological status, indicates effective management of SIADH."
