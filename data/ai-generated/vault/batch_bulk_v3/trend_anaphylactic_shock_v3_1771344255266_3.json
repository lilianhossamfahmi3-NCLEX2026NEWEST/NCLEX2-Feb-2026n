                "rationale": "Incorrect. While the heart rate does increase from 110 at 09:15 to 136 at 09:30, this finding is a compensatory response to hypotension. The core problems driving the worsening condition are the circulatory collapse (blood pressure) and respiratory failure (SpO2, breath sounds), which cause the tachycardia. Therefore, blood pressure and respiratory findings are more direct indicators of deterioration."

This drop, despite ongoing fluid resuscitation and initial epinephrine, signifies persistent vasodilation and capillary leakage, leading to circulatory collapse. This is a primary indicator of worsening anaphylactic shock."

                "rationale": "Correct. The SpO2 improves to 94% with high-flow oxygen at 09:15 but then declines to 90%. This decrease, despite maximal oxygen therapy, indicates worsening gas exchange due to progressive bronchoconstriction and laryngeal edema, signaling impending respiratory failure."

Stridor indicates severe upper airway obstruction (laryngeal edema) and is a strong predictor of complete airway closure and respiratory arrest. This represents a critical worsening of the client's respiratory status."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. The skin findings, specifically the fading urticaria, show a positive response to antihistamines and epinephrine. This can be misleading. A provider must prioritize systemic, life-threatening changes (airway, breathing, circulation) over cutaneous improvements. The development of pale, cool skin at 09:30 is a sign of shock, but the overall skin trend including fading urticaria is not the most reliable indicator of worsening compared to the hemodynamic and respiratory collapse."
