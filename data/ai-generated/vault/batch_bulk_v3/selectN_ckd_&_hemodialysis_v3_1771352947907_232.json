          "rationale": "Correct. The client's blood pressure is 102/58 mmHg, and they report dizziness, suggesting orthostatic hypotension. Rapid fluid removal during hemodialysis (3.2 kg or 7 lbs in this case) can lead to decreased circulating blood volume and subsequent hypotension. Assisting the client to rise slowly allows the body to compensate for the blood volume shift, preventing falls. Clinical Pearl: Monitor BP closely post-dialysis. Teach clients to rise slowly and dangle their legs before standing.",
          "pathophysiology": "Orthostatic hypotension occurs due to a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain upon standing. In ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis, the rapid removal of fluid can exacerbate this by reducing blood volume and impairing the body's ability to compensate for positional changes.",

Furthermore, ESRD clients are typically on fluid restrictions. Administering 240 mL of fluid without a specific order or indication is inappropriate and could contribute to fluid overload. Clinical Pearl: Always assess the cause of dizziness before intervening. Avoid unnecessary fluid administration in ESRD patients.",
          "pathophysiology": "Hypotension post-dialysis is primarily caused by a reduction in circulating blood volume due to ultrafiltration. Giving fluids without a clear indication can lead to fluid overload, increasing the risk of pulmonary edema and heart failure in ESRD patients.",

          "rationale": "Correct. A patent AV fistula should have a palpable thrill and an audible bruit. The diminished thrill and absent bruit are signs of potential fistula stenosis or thrombosis, which compromises vascular access. Prompt notification of the healthcare provider is crucial for immediate evaluation (e.g., Doppler ultrasound) and intervention (e.g., thrombolysis, angioplasty) to prevent complete access loss. Clinical Pearl: Loss of AV fistula patency requires immediate intervention to preserve vascular access for dialysis.",

Administering lisinopril would further decrease the blood pressure, potentially causing severe hypotension, syncope, and injury. Antihypertensive medications are typically held on dialysis days or administered post-dialysis only if the blood pressure is stable and elevated. Clinical Pearl: Withhold antihypertensives if the patient is hypotensive post-dialysis.",
          "pathophysiology": "ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. In a patient who is already hypotensive due to fluid removal during dialysis, administering an ACE inhibitor can lead to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.",

Clinical Pearl: Do not delay seeking medical evaluation for a compromised AV fistula.",

Clinical Pearl: Consistent reinforcement of dietary and fluid restrictions is essential for ESRD patients.",
