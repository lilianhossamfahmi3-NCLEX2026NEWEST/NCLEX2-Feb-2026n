    "answerBreakdown": {
        "condition": {
            "C1": "Incorrect. While the client has signs of fluid overload (edema, crackles) consistent with heart failure, the primary driver is the significant and acute decline in kidney function. The drastic rise in creatinine from baseline (1.1 to 3.8 mg/dL) and the history of NSAID use point specifically to a kidney-related problem, making AKI the most precise diagnosis.",
            "C2": "Correct. The client's presentation aligns perfectly with AKI. Key indicators include a recent history of high-dose NSAID use (a common cause of pre-renal AKI), a rapid increase in serum creatinine and BUN, oliguria (15 mL/hr), low eGFR, and signs of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance (hyperkalemia, hyponatremia).",
            "C3": "Incorrect. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over months or years. This client's creatinine has risen sharply from a normal baseline just three months ago, indicating an acute, not chronic, process.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. While edema is present, there is no information about proteinuria, and the primary lab abnormalities are elevated creatinine and potassium, which are more indicative of AKI.",
            "C5": "Incorrect. The client is hypertensive (172/98 mmHg), but this is likely a consequence of the fluid overload caused by AKI rather than the primary condition. A hypertensive crisis typically involves a BP >180/120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage, and while AKI is a form of end-organ damage, it is the central problem here."
        },
        "actions": {
            "A1": "Correct. The client is hypervolemic (fluid overloaded) as evidenced by bibasilar crackles, pitting edema, and hypertension. A loop diuretic like furosemide is essential to promote diuresis, remove excess fluid, and help lower the elevated potassium level.",
            "A2": "Incorrect. Administering a fluid bolus is contraindicated. This action would be appropriate for pre-renal AKI caused by hypovolemia. However, this client is clearly hypervolemic, and additional fluids would worsen the pulmonary edema and hypertension, potentially leading to respiratory failure.",
            "A3": "Correct. The serum potassium is 5.8 mEq/L (hyperkalemia), which poses a significant and immediate risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect any ECG changes (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS) and intervene promptly.",
            "A4": "Incorrect. Encouraging oral fluid intake would exacerbate the client's fluid overload. A fluid restriction is the appropriate intervention to manage hypervolemia in a client with AKI and oliguria.",
            "A5": "Incorrect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Administering this medication to a client who is already hyperkalemic (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) is extremely dangerous and could lead to severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest."
        },
        "parameters": {
            "P1": "Correct. Monitoring urine output is a critical parameter to assess kidney function and the client's response to interventions like diuretics. An increase in urine output would indicate improving renal perfusion and function.",
            "P2": "Incorrect. While blood glucose is a standard parameter to monitor in hospitalized patients, there is no indication in the client's history or presentation that they have diabetes or are at immediate risk for glycemic instability. It is not a priority compared to parameters directly related to the AKI.",
            "P3": "Incorrect. The client has no signs or symptoms of infection (e.g., fever, localized pain, elevated temperature). Therefore, monitoring the white blood cell count is not a priority in managing this client's acute problem.",
            "P4": "Correct. Hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) is a life-threatening complication of AKI. The serum potassium level must be monitored closely to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments (e.g., diuretics, potassium-lowering agents) and to prevent cardiac arrest.",
            "P5": "Incorrect. The client has a history of osteoarthritis and was taking ibuprofen for knee pain, but pain is not the acute, life-threatening problem. The immediate priorities are managing the fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired kidney function."
