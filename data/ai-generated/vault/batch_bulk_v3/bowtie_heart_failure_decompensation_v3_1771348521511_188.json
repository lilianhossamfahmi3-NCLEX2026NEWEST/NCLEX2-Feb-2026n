The immediate priorities are to reduce fluid volume (preload/afterload) and improve oxygenation. Administering IV furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, will rapidly promote diuresis and remove excess fluid from the pulmonary vasculature. Applying BiPAP will decrease the work of breathing, improve gas exchange, and reduce both preload and afterload by increasing intrathoracic pressure. Monitoring oxygen saturation is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of BiPAP and the client's respiratory status. Monitoring urine output is essential to assess the client's response to the diuretic therapy.",
            "incorrect": "Other conditions are less likely. Pneumonia is unlikely given the afebrile state and classic HF signs. A pulmonary embolism typically presents with pleuritic chest pain. A myocardial infarction is a possible cause of ADHF, but the primary clinical syndrome is fluid overload. A COPD exacerbation would more likely present with wheezing. Inappropriate actions include administering a fluid bolus, which would worsen fluid overload, or IV metoprolol, as beta-blockers can decrease contractility and are contraindicated in acute decompensation. Intubation is a later step if BiPAP fails. Monitoring blood glucose, temperature, or an admission weight are not the most critical *immediate* parameters to track response to the initial interventions.",
