        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation—sudden severe hypertension (210/118 mmHg), sinus tachycardia (138/min), pounding headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis—is a classic manifestation of a hypertensive crisis caused by a massive release of catecholamines. This can occur post-adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma due to manipulation of the adrenal gland during surgery or from residual tumor tissue. The priority actions are to immediately lower the dangerously high blood pressure using the prescribed fast-acting vasodilator (sodium nitroprusside) and to decrease cerebral pressure by placing the client in a high-Fowler's position. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure is crucial to titrate the medication effectively and avoid hypotension, while continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect life-threatening dysrhythmias caused by catecholamine excess.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect conditions like hemorrhagic shock or adrenal insufficiency would present with hypotension, not extreme hypertension. A pulmonary embolism typically presents with dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia, but profound hypertension is not a hallmark sign. The priority actions must address the cause of the crisis. Administering propranolol (a beta-blocker) without first establishing alpha-blockade can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, paradoxically worsening the hypertension. A fluid bolus is contraindicated as it would increase vascular volume and further elevate blood pressure. Morphine may help with anxiety and pain but is not the primary intervention for a hypertensive crisis. Monitoring parameters must focus on the immediate cardiovascular threat; while urine output and pupillary response are important, they are secondary to the critical need for beat-to-beat BP and cardiac rhythm surveillance.",
