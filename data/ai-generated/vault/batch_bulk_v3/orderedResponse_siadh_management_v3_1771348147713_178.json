Drag and drop the interventions from the left to the right, placing the highest priority action at the top.",

    "correct": "The correct order prioritizes patient safety, establishes a neurological baseline, corrects hyponatremia, manages fluid balance, and monitors treatment effectiveness. Severe hyponatremia (Na+ 118 mEq/L) in SIADH causes cellular swelling, especially in the brain, leading to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, manifesting as confusion and posing a high seizure risk. Initiating seizure precautions is paramount. A comprehensive neurological assessment establishes a baseline to detect changes during hypertonic saline administration. Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) slowly increases serum sodium, reducing cerebral edema. Rapid correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Fluid restriction is crucial in SIADH to prevent further sodium dilution. Daily weight monitors fluid balance and treatment response.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect orders fail to prioritize immediate safety from seizure risk due to cerebral edema. Delaying seizure precautions while performing other tasks could result in patient harm. Administering hypertonic saline without a neurological baseline prevents accurate assessment of treatment response and early detection of complications like ODS. Placing fluid restriction or daily weight before acute treatment inappropriately delays care for a life-threatening condition.",
