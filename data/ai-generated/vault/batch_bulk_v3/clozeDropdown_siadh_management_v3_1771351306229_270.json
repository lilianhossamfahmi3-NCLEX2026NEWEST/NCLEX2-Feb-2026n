        "correct": "The comprehensive management of SIADH involves addressing the fluid overload and dilutional hyponatremia. This is achieved by restricting fluid intake, increasing dietary sodium to help raise serum sodium levels, and implementing safety measures for potential neurologic complications like seizures caused by cerebral edema from low sodium. For severe cases, slow infusion of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) is used to correct the sodium level without causing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Loop diuretics like furosemide are administered to promote the excretion of free water, which helps concentrate the serum sodium.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect interventions would either worsen the condition or fail to address the primary pathophysiology. Encouraging ambulation without addressing the risk of seizures is unsafe. Administering hypotonic (0.45% NaCl, D5W) or isotonic fluids would worsen the fluid overload and hyponatremia. Desmopressin is a treatment for diabetes insipidus and would exacerbate SIADH. Spironolactone is not the first-line diuretic for this condition. Diets high in potassium or calcium do not address the primary electrolyte imbalance of hyponatremia.",
