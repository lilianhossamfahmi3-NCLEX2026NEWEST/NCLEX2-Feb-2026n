    "correct": "In SIADH, excessive ADH leads to water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and decreased serum osmolality. Management focuses on correcting the fluid and electrolyte imbalance while addressing the underlying cause. A diet high in sodium helps to increase serum sodium levels. Implementing seizure precautions is crucial due to the risk of cerebral edema and seizures from hyponatremia. Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) is administered cautiously to raise serum sodium levels slowly, preventing osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes free water excretion, further aiding in sodium concentration. Close monitoring of neurological status, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is essential.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect interventions can worsen the client's condition. Encouraging ambulation in a confused and lethargic client increases the risk of falls. Hypotonic solutions (0.45% NaCl, D5W) exacerbate hyponatremia and fluid overload. Desmopressin, an ADH analog, is contraindicated in SIADH as it would worsen water retention. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and not the primary choice for promoting free water excretion in SIADH. Diets high in potassium or calcium do not directly address the hyponatremia.",
