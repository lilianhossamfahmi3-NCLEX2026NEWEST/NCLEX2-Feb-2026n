Despite receiving a continuous infusion of Lactated Ringer's, the client's heart rate is steadily increasing, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is decreasing, and the urine output is persistently well below the target of 30-50 mL/hr for an adult. Furthermore, the rising serum lactate level signifies worsening tissue hypoperfusion and a shift to anaerobic metabolism, a key indicator of shock. These cues together create a clear picture that the current fluid rate is insufficient to compensate for the massive intravascular fluid loss.",
        "incorrect": "Other conclusions are not supported by the data. An appropriate response would show normalization of vital signs (decreasing HR, MAP > 65 mmHg) and adequate urine output (>30 mL/hr). Fluid overload would present with the opposite findings: hypertension, bradycardia, and high urine output. A septic response is less likely in this initial 6-hour period; the signs presented are classic for distributive/hypovolemic shock secondary to the burn injury itself, not an infection.",
