    "correct": "[+] The trend data indicates inadequate fluid resuscitation, also known as burn shock. Despite receiving a continuous infusion of Lactated Ringer's, the client's heart rate is steadily increasing, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is decreasing, and the urine output is persistently well below the target of 30-50 mL/hr for an adult. Furthermore, the rising serum lactate level signifies worsening tissue hypoperfusion and a shift to anaerobic metabolism, a key indicator of shock. These cues together create a clear picture that the current fluid rate is insufficient to compensate for the massive intravascular fluid loss. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Burn injuries cause significant damage to the capillaries, leading to increased capillary permeability. This allows fluid and proteins to leak from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, resulting in hypovolemia and decreased cardiac output. The body attempts to compensate by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction (increasing MAP), but these mechanisms eventually fail if fluid loss is not adequately addressed. The rising lactate indicates anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.",
    "incorrect": "[-] Other conclusions are not supported by the data. An appropriate response would show normalization of vital signs (decreasing HR, MAP > 65 mmHg) and adequate urine output (>30 mL/hr). Fluid overload would present with the opposite findings: hypertension, bradycardia, and high urine output. A septic response is less likely in this initial 6-hour period; the signs presented are classic for distributive/hypovolemic shock secondary to the burn injury itself, not an infection.",
