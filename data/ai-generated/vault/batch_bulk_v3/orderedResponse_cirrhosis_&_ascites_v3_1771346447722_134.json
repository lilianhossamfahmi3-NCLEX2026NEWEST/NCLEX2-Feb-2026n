The provider has written several orders.\n\n**Client Data:**\n- Temperature: 37.8°C (100.0°F)\n- Heart Rate: 112/min\n- Respiratory Rate: 26/min and shallow\n- Blood Pressure: 105/68 mmHg\n- SpO2: 90% on room air\n- Ammonia: 110 mcg/dL (Normal: 15-45 mcg/dL)\n- INR: 2.0 (Normal: <1.1)\n- WBC: 12,500/mm³ (Normal: 4,500-11,000/mm³)\n\nThe nurse should perform the following actions in which order?

Paracentesis provides definitive relief but follows initial stabilization. Dietary modifications are long-term management and are addressed last.",

Tense ascites restricts diaphragmatic movement, impairing lung expansion. High-Fowler's uses gravity to lower the diaphragm, increasing thoracic capacity. Supplemental oxygen directly addresses hypoxemia. This intervention improves oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing.",
