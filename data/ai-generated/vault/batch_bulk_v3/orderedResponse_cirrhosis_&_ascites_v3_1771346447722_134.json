The client presents with increasing abdominal girth, shortness of breath, and confusion. The nurse notes jaundice, tense ascites, asterixis, and +3 pitting edema in the lower extremities. The provider has written several orders.\n\n**Client Data:**\n- Temperature: 37.8°C (100.0°F)\n- Heart Rate: 112/min\n- Respiratory Rate: 26/min and shallow\n- Blood Pressure: 105/68 mmHg\n- SpO2: 90% on room air\n- Ammonia: 110 mcg/dL (Normal: 15-45 mcg/dL)\n- INR: 2.0 (Normal: <1.1)\n- WBC: 12,500/mm³ (Normal: 4,500-11,000/mm³)\n\nThe nurse should perform the following actions in which order?

        "correct": "The correct sequence of actions is based on the principles of prioritization, starting with Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs), followed by addressing acute life-threatening conditions like infection and encephalopathy, preparing for definitive treatment, and finally implementing longer-term management strategies. The client's immediate threat is respiratory compromise due to ascites, which must be addressed first. Subsequently, the potential for sepsis (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis) and worsening hepatic encephalopathy are addressed through diagnostics and medication administration. The therapeutic paracentesis, while crucial, follows initial stabilization. Dietary modifications are the last priority in this acute setting.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence would neglect immediate life threats. For example, preparing for paracentesis or instituting dietary changes before stabilizing the client's respiratory status would be incorrect as it fails to address the most immediate life-threatening problem (impaired gas exchange). Administering medications is not possible before establishing IV access, and drawing blood cultures before starting antibiotics is critical to identify the causative organism for suspected SBP.",

The client's SpO2 is 90% with tachypnea and shallow respirations, indicating respiratory distress. The tense ascites is causing diaphragmatic splinting, limiting lung expansion. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position uses gravity to lower the diaphragm, increasing thoracic capacity and easing the work of breathing, while supplemental oxygen directly addresses the hypoxemia.",

After addressing the immediate respiratory threat, the next priority is to prepare for medication administration and to investigate the cause of the fever and leukocytosis.

IV antibiotics are urgently needed to treat the suspected SBP. Lactulose is administered to treat the hepatic encephalopathy, evidenced by the client's confusion, asterixis, and elevated ammonia level.

This procedure will provide definitive relief from the respiratory distress by removing the ascitic fluid that is compressing the diaphragm. However, it is prioritized after initial respiratory stabilization and initiation of treatment for infection and encephalopathy because it requires preparation (e.g., informed consent, gathering supplies, patient positioning) and is not as immediately life-saving as oxygenation and antibiotic therapy.",
