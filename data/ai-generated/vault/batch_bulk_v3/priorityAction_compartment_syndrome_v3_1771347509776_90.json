The client has a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine. The client called the nurse to the room reporting severe, escalating pain in the right lower leg.\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x4. Anxious and distressed due to pain.\n*   **Pain:** Reports 10/10 pain in the right lower leg, describing it as a deep, burning pressure. States the PCA is \"not working at all.\" Last PCA dose was 15 minutes ago. Pain is significantly worse when the nurse passively dorsiflexes the client's ankle.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate 118/min, Blood pressure 148/88 mmHg, Capillary refill of right great toe is 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse on the right foot is faintly palpable with Doppler only.\n*   **Integumentary:** Right lower leg is visibly swollen, tense, and appears pale and shiny compared to the left leg. Surgical dressing is dry and intact.\n*   **Sensation:** Client reports a \"pins and needles\" sensation and numbness in the web space between the great and second toe of the right foot."

Without prompt intervention, irreversible neuromuscular damage, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, or limb loss can occur within 4-6 hours.

Therefore, the absolute priority is to notify the surgeon immediately to facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention.",
