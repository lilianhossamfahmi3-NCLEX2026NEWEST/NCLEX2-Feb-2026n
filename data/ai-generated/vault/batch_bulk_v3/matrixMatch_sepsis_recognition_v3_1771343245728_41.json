    "correct": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition arising from a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction. The nurse must differentiate between SIRS criteria, indicating systemic inflammation, and signs of organ dysfunction, which signify a more severe stage. Early recognition of organ dysfunction is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes. SIRS criteria alone (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea) do not confirm sepsis but suggest the body is mounting an inflammatory response. Organ dysfunction (hypotension, altered mental status, elevated lactate) indicates the inflammatory response is causing tissue damage and impaired organ function.",
    "incorrect": "Failure to differentiate between SIRS and organ dysfunction can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment. Mistaking organ dysfunction for simple SIRS may result in underestimation of the client's condition, delaying critical interventions like fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and vasopressors. This can lead to irreversible organ damage, septic shock, and increased mortality.",

        "content": "Correct. This aligns with SIRS criteria, defined as a core temperature >38°C (100.4°F) or <36°C (96.8°F). The elevated temperature reflects the body's inflammatory response to the suspected infection, mediated by pyrogens that reset the hypothalamic thermostat.",

        "label": "Heart rate 128/min",
        "content": "Correct. Tachycardia (HR >90 bpm) is a SIRS criterion. It's a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the face of vasodilation and potential hypovolemia, driven by the release of catecholamines and inflammatory mediators.",

        "label": "Serum lactate 4.2 mmol/L",
        "content": "Correct. Elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) indicates organ dysfunction. It signifies anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoperfusion, a hallmark of sepsis. This occurs when oxygen delivery is insufficient to meet metabolic demands, leading to lactic acid production. Persistent hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality.",
