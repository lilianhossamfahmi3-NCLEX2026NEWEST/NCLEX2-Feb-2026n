  "question": "The nurse is caring for a 22-year-old client admitted 3 days ago for major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation. The client was started on sertraline 50 mg daily two days ago. During morning rounds at 0900, the nurse finds the client smiling, energetic, and neatly packing their belongings. The client states, 'I feel so much better! I've finally figured everything out and I'm ready to move on.' Which action should the nurse take **first**?",

    "correct": "The priority action is to implement one-to-one observation. The client's sudden improvement in mood and energy, shortly after starting sertraline, is a critical warning sign for a potential suicide attempt. Sertraline, an SSRI, can initially provide the energy to act on pre-existing suicidal ideations before its therapeutic effects fully manifest. The statement 'I've finally figured everything out' suggests the client may have finalized a suicide plan. Continuous observation is crucial to prevent self-harm.",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are important, they are secondary to ensuring immediate safety. Documenting, notifying the provider, and direct questioning are necessary but should follow the implementation of one-to-one observation. Congratulating the client is inappropriate and could reinforce a potentially dangerous situation. Delaying observation increases the risk of the client acting on a suicide plan.",

        "label": "A",

The sudden mood elevation and statement suggest imminent risk. One-to-one observation provides immediate safety, allowing for a safer environment to conduct further assessment.",
        "isCorrect": false

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. The client's sudden shift in affect, coupled with the statement, indicates a high risk of suicide. SSRIs can paradoxically increase the risk of suicide early in treatment by providing the energy to act on suicidal thoughts.
