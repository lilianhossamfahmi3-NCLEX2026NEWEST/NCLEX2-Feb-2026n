The client was started on sertraline 50 mg daily two days ago. During morning rounds, the nurse finds the client smiling, energetic, and neatly packing their belongings. The client states, 'I feel so much better! I've finally figured everything out and I'm ready to move on.' Which action should the nurse take **first**?",

        "correct": "The priority action is to implement one-to-one observation. The client is exhibiting classic warning signs of a planned suicide. A sudden, dramatic improvement in mood and energy in a severely depressed client, especially shortly after starting an antidepressant, is a major red flag. It often indicates that the client has made the decision to commit suicide and now has the energy to carry out their plan. The client's statement, 'I've finally figured everything out,' can be interpreted as having finalized a suicide plan. Therefore, ensuring immediate and constant visual supervision is the top priority to maintain patient safety.",
        "incorrect": "While direct questioning, notifying the provider, and documentation are all important nursing actions, they are not the first priority when there is a high risk of imminent self-harm. The immediate priority is to ensure the client cannot act on a potential suicide plan. Congratulating the client is therapeutically inappropriate and demonstrates a failure to recognize a critical safety risk.",

The risk of an imminent attempt is so high based on the presented cues (sudden mood lift, finalizing statements, increased energy from SSRI) that ensuring the client cannot be left alone to act on a plan takes precedence over further verbal assessment. The nurse should initiate observation first to secure the environment and then proceed with direct questioning.",

The client's sudden shift from severe depression to a cheerful and energetic state after starting an SSRI is a well-documented risk period for suicide. This 'lifting of depression' can provide the energy needed to execute a pre-existing suicide plan. Instituting one-to-one observation immediately ensures the client's safety, which is the absolute priority according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.",
