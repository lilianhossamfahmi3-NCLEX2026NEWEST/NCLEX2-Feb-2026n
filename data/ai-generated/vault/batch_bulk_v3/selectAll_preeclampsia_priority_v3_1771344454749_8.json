    "leadIn": "The nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client at 34 weeks gestation admitted with preeclampsia with severe features. The client is receiving an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate at 2 g/hr. The client's vital signs 30 minutes ago were: BP 177/113 mmHg, HR 92/min, RR 18/min, SpO2 98% on room air. The nurse enters the room for a scheduled assessment and the client states, 'My headache is suddenly a 10 out of 10, and I'm seeing sparkles.'",

            "rationale": "Correct. Assessing DTRs and for the presence of clonus is a critical and immediate action. Hyperreflexia (e.g., +3 or +4) and clonus are indicators of increased central nervous system irritability and an impending eclamptic seizure. This assessment provides vital data about the client's neurological status and risk for seizure."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The nurse cannot independently increase the rate of a high-alert medication like magnesium sulfate. This action requires a provider's order. While the client's symptoms are worsening, the immediate priority is to assess, ensure safety, and communicate, not to titrate medication without an order."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's report of a severe headache and visual disturbances ('sparkles' or scotomata) are classic signs of worsening preeclampsia and impending eclampsia. Ensuring seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction and oxygen at the bedside, dimming lights) is a crucial, immediate safety intervention to protect the client in the event of a seizure."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's last blood pressure was severely elevated (177/113 mmHg). The new onset of severe headache and visual changes strongly suggests that cerebral vasospasm is occurring due to uncontrolled hypertension. Administering the prescribed PRN antihypertensive is a priority action to lower the blood pressure and reduce the risk of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) or seizure."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "rationale": "Correct. The significant change in the client's condition, including the severe headache and visual disturbances, indicates a clinical deterioration and high risk for an eclamptic seizure. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate communication with the healthcare provider to facilitate further interventions, which may include emergent delivery of the fetus."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is in pain, a severe headache associated with preeclampsia is a sign of cerebral edema and irritation, not a simple analgesic-responsive headache. The priority is to treat the underlying cause (severe hypertension and CNS irritability) and prevent seizures, not to mask a critical symptom with a mild analgesic. Administering acetaminophen is not an immediate, life-saving action in this context."
