  "leadIn": "The nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client at 34 weeks gestation admitted with preeclampsia with severe features. The client is receiving an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate at 2 g/hr. The client's vital signs 30 minutes ago were: BP 177/113 mmHg, HR 92/min, RR 18/min, SpO2 98% on room air. The nurse enters the room for a scheduled assessment and the client states, 'My headache is suddenly a 10 out of 10, and I'm seeing sparkles.'",

      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "rationale": "Correct. Assessing DTRs and clonus is critical. Hyperreflexia (+3 or +4) and clonus indicate CNS irritability and impending eclampsia. Preeclampsia reduces cerebral blood flow and causes endothelial damage, leading to cerebral edema and increased CNS excitability. Magnesium sulfate, a CNS depressant, is used to prevent seizures. Assessing DTRs helps evaluate magnesium toxicity (hyporeflexia) or worsening preeclampsia (hyperreflexia). Clinical Pearl: Monitor for magnesium toxicity (loss of DTRs, respiratory depression).",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Increasing magnesium sulfate requires a provider's order. While symptoms worsen, assess, ensure safety, and communicate first. Preeclampsia causes vasoconstriction and decreased organ perfusion. Magnesium sulfate prevents seizures but doesn't treat the underlying hypertension. Increasing the dose without an order could lead to magnesium toxicity. Clinical Pearl: Never adjust high-alert medications without an order.",

      "rationale": "Correct. Severe headache and visual disturbances (scotomata) indicate worsening preeclampsia and impending eclampsia. Ensure seizure precautions (padded side rails, suction, oxygen). Preeclampsia causes cerebral edema and increased CNS excitability, increasing seizure risk. Seizure precautions minimize injury during a seizure. Clinical Pearl: Protect the client from injury during a seizure.",

      "rationale": "Correct. BP 177/113 mmHg is severely elevated. Headache and visual changes suggest cerebral vasospasm due to uncontrolled hypertension. Administer prescribed labetalol to lower BP and reduce stroke/seizure risk. Preeclampsia causes systemic vasoconstriction, leading to hypertension. Labetalol, a beta-blocker, reduces BP by decreasing heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Clinical Pearl: Rapidly lower severely elevated BP to prevent end-organ damage.",

Clinical Pearl: Early recognition and intervention are crucial in preeclampsia.",

Preeclampsia-related headaches are caused by cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Acetaminophen will not address the underlying pathophysiology.
