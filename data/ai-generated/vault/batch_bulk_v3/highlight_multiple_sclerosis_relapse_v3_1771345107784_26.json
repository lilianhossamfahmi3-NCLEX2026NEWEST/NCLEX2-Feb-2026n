States, \"I've been so tired lately, more than usual.\" Reports that for the past 48 hours, her vision has been blurry in her right eye. She also mentions, \"when I look to the side, I see double.\" She states she had a similar episode years ago but this feels different. The client also reports, \"a new, persistent numbness that started in my fingertips and now covers my whole left hand.\" She mentions her chronic back pain feels about the same as usual. She adds, \"my right leg feels heavy and weak, making it hard to walk up the stairs.\" The client states she has been under significant stress at work recently. She has been adherent with her glatiramer acetate injections.",

            "rationale": "Incorrect. While fatigue is a very common and often debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis, it is considered a baseline symptom. An increase in fatigue alone, without new or worsening focal neurological deficits, does not typically signify a true relapse and is not a priority for immediate follow-up compared to other reported symptoms."

            "rationale": "Correct. New or worsening blurry vision is a hallmark symptom of optic neuritis, a common presentation of an MS relapse. This indicates inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve and requires prompt assessment and potential intervention."

            "rationale": "Correct. Diplopia (double vision) is a significant neurological finding that suggests a new demyelinating lesion in the brainstem affecting the cranial nerves that control eye movements. This is a classic sign of an MS relapse and necessitates immediate follow-up."

            "rationale": "Correct. The development of new and persistent sensory changes, such as numbness (paresthesia), is a key indicator of an MS relapse. The progression from fingertips to the whole hand over a short period suggests active demyelination in the central nervous system."
