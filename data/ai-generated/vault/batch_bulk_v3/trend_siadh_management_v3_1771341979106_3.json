After showing initial improvement on Day 2 (serum sodium increased to 122 mEq/L, GCS improved to 14), the client experienced a significant decline on Day 3. The serum sodium dropped to a dangerous level of 119 mEq/L, and the neurological assessment revealed a GCS of 10, indicating severe impairment. These findings, coupled with the new onset of a severe headache, suggest worsening cerebral edema due to acute hyponatremia. The fluid restriction is no longer sufficient, and the client requires immediate, more aggressive intervention, such as administration of hypertonic saline, to prevent seizures, coma, or cerebral herniation.",

A drop in serum sodium from 122 to 119 mEq/L, accompanied by a four-point drop in GCS, is a medical emergency, not an expected fluctuation or a sign of stabilization. While the BP is elevated and HR is lower, the primary cause of the deterioration is the severe hyponatremia and its effect on the brain, not the vital sign changes themselves, which are likely a secondary response (Cushing's triad may be developing).",
