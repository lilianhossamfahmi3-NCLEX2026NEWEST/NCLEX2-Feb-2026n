Risk factors include post-operative status, obesity, and reduced mobility, increasing venous stasis and clot formation risk. The sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain indicates possible pulmonary infarction and inflammation. Tachycardia and tachypnea are compensatory mechanisms to maintain oxygenation. Hypoxia (SpO2 89%) results from ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to the blocked pulmonary artery. The elevated D-dimer indicates fibrin degradation, supporting the presence of a clot. Anxiety is a common response to hypoxia and the feeling of impending doom.",

The client exhibits classic signs and symptoms: sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia (124 bpm), tachypnea (28/min), and hypoxia (SpO2 89%). These findings, coupled with risk factors (post-op, obesity, immobility) and an elevated D-dimer (2.5 mcg/mL), strongly suggest a PE. A PE occurs when a blood clot lodges in a pulmonary artery, obstructing blood flow and causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxia. The pleuritic chest pain arises from inflammation of the pleura due to pulmonary infarction.",

While the client's blood pressure has decreased slightly (130/80 to 110/72), the primary symptoms are respiratory distress and hypoxia, which are not characteristic of hemorrhage. Hemorrhage leads to decreased circulating blood volume, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues, but the acute respiratory symptoms are more indicative of a pulmonary issue.

Furthermore, the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain is not consistent with anxiety. Anxiety is a diagnosis of exclusion and should only be considered after ruling out life-threatening conditions like PE. Anxiety primarily affects the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate and respiratory rate, but it does not directly impair gas exchange in the lungs to the extent seen in this client.",

While a post-operative infection can lead to systemic inflammation, it would not cause the acute respiratory symptoms and hypoxia seen in this case.
