    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client at 35 weeks gestation who was admitted 12 hours ago for management of preeclampsia without severe features. The client is receiving a maintenance infusion of intravenous lactated Ringer's solution. Which of the following assessment findings is most concerning and requires immediate notification of the healthcare provider?",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "A": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. A blood pressure of 150/98 mmHg is elevated and meets the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. However, in a client already diagnosed and being monitored, this finding alone does not signify the most acute progression of the disease compared to other signs of end-organ damage. The priority is to identify new, severe features."
        },
        "B": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Proteinuria of 2+ is an expected finding in a client with preeclampsia, as it reflects kidney involvement. While it confirms the diagnosis, it is not an indicator of an impending life-threatening complication such as an eclamptic seizure or HELLP syndrome."
        },
        "C": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. New-onset epigastric pain is a critical finding that indicates the progression to preeclampsia with severe features. This symptom is caused by liver swelling and stretching of the hepatic (Glisson's) capsule, which can precede liver rupture or an eclamptic seizure. It is the most ominous sign among the options and requires immediate intervention."
        },
        "D": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Deep tendon reflexes of 3+ (brisk) indicate central nervous system irritability associated with preeclampsia. While this finding necessitates close monitoring, the absence of clonus makes it less immediately critical than epigastric pain, which signals severe end-organ (liver) involvement and a higher risk of imminent seizure."
