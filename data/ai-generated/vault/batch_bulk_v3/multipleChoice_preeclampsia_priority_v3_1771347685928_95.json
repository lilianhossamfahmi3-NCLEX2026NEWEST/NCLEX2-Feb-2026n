  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client at 35 weeks gestation who was admitted 12 hours ago for management of preeclampsia without severe features. The client is receiving a maintenance infusion of intravenous lactated Ringer's solution. Which of the following assessment findings is most concerning and requires immediate notification of the healthcare provider?",

    "A": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a blood pressure of 150/98 mmHg is elevated and meets preeclampsia diagnostic criteria, it's not the MOST concerning finding in a client already diagnosed and being monitored. The priority is identifying new, severe features indicating imminent complications. Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, but the severity is determined by end-organ damage. This BP reading, while requiring attention, doesn't indicate acute deterioration compared to epigastric pain.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor BP closely, but prioritize assessment for severe features like epigastric pain, visual changes, or severe headache."
    },
    "B": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Proteinuria of 2+ is an expected finding in preeclampsia, reflecting kidney involvement due to endothelial dysfunction and increased glomerular permeability. While it confirms the diagnosis, it's not an indicator of an impending life-threatening complication like eclampsia or HELLP syndrome. The pathophysiology involves impaired renal perfusion and damage to the glomerular basement membrane, leading to protein leakage.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Proteinuria is a diagnostic criterion, but worsening symptoms are more critical."
    },
    "C": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. New-onset epigastric pain is a critical finding indicating progression to preeclampsia WITH severe features. This symptom results from liver swelling and stretching of the Glisson's capsule due to hepatic ischemia and hemorrhage. This can precede liver rupture, HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), or an eclamptic seizure. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications. The pain is often described as a burning or aching sensation in the upper right quadrant or epigastric region.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Epigastric pain in preeclampsia is a red flag! It suggests impending liver complications and requires immediate action. Think HELLP syndrome or liver rupture."
    },
    "D": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Deep tendon reflexes of 3+ (brisk) indicate central nervous system (CNS) irritability associated with preeclampsia, caused by cerebral edema and increased neuronal excitability. While this finding necessitates close monitoring for seizure activity, the absence of clonus makes it less immediately critical than epigastric pain, which signals severe end-organ (liver) involvement and a higher risk of imminent seizure or HELLP syndrome. Clonus indicates more severe CNS involvement.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Increased DTRs are concerning, but epigastric pain takes precedence. Assess for clonus to further evaluate CNS irritability."

    "situation": "32-year-old female, 35 weeks gestation, admitted 12 hours ago for preeclampsia management without severe features. Receiving IV lactated Ringer's solution.",
    "background": "Preeclampsia diagnosed based on elevated blood pressure and proteinuria. Baseline assessments stable upon admission. No history of seizures or HELLP syndrome.",
    "assessment": "Client reports new-onset epigastric pain at 1400. Blood pressure 150/98 mmHg. Deep tendon reflexes 3+ without clonus. Urine protein 2+ on dipstick.",
    "recommendation": "Notify the healthcare provider immediately regarding the new-onset epigastric pain. Anticipate orders for further evaluation of liver function (AST, ALT), platelet count, and potential magnesium sulfate administration to prevent seizures. Prepare for possible transfer to a higher level of care."
