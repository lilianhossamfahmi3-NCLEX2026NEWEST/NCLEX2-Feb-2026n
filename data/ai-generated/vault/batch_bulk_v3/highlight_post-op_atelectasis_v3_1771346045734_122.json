Client exhibits shallow respirations and reports sharp pain with deep inspiration. Vital signs: BP 130/84 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 24/min, Temperature 100.8°F (38.2°C). SpO2 is 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in bilateral lower lobes. Receiving IV Lactated Ringer's at 75 mL/hr. Urine output is 40 mL/hr for the last 2 hours.",

        "correct": "The combination of shallow respirations, pleuritic pain, low-grade fever, mild hypoxemia, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes presents a classic clinical picture of post-operative atelectasis. Incisional pain leads to splinting and shallow breathing, which prevents full alveolar expansion. This hypoventilation causes alveoli to collapse (atelectasis), leading to impaired gas exchange (low SpO2), diminished breath sounds over the affected area, and a subsequent inflammatory response (low-grade fever). These cues together indicate a significant pulmonary complication requiring intervention.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected findings, while important for a comprehensive post-operative assessment, are not direct indicators of atelectasis. Abdominal pain is the underlying cause of the splinting but not the resulting pulmonary sign. A clean dressing, hypoactive bowel sounds, and adequate urine output are expected or relate to other body systems (integumentary, gastrointestinal, renal) and do not specifically point to a respiratory complication like atelectasis.",
