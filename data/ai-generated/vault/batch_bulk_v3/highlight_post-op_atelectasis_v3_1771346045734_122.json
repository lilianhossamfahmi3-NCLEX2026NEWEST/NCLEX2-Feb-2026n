    "correct": "The combination of shallow respirations, pleuritic pain, low-grade fever, mild hypoxemia, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes strongly suggests post-operative atelectasis. Post-operative pain often leads to splinting and reduced inspiratory effort, resulting in hypoventilation. This hypoventilation causes alveolar collapse (atelectasis). The collapsed alveoli impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia (SpO2 92%). The inflammatory response to the alveolar collapse triggers a low-grade fever. Diminished breath sounds are a direct result of reduced airflow to the affected lung regions. These cues collectively indicate a significant pulmonary complication requiring immediate intervention to prevent further complications like pneumonia.",
    "incorrect": "The unselected findings, while relevant to a comprehensive post-operative assessment, do not directly indicate atelectasis. Abdominal pain is a contributing factor but not a direct sign of the pulmonary complication. A clean dressing indicates proper wound care, and hypoactive bowel sounds are common post-operatively due to anesthesia and bowel manipulation. Adequate urine output suggests sufficient renal perfusion and hydration, but it does not rule out respiratory complications.",

    "Post-operative atelectasis is a frequent complication, especially after abdominal surgeries. Early detection and intervention are vital to prevent pneumonia and other respiratory complications.",
    "Encourage deep breathing exercises, coughing, and incentive spirometry to promote lung expansion and prevent alveolar collapse. Proper technique is essential for effective use of the incentive spirometer.",
    "Effective pain management is crucial to facilitate adequate respiratory effort. Administer analgesics as prescribed and assess their effectiveness regularly. Consider non-pharmacological pain management techniques.",
    "Closely monitor vital signs, particularly respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature, in post-operative clients. Report any significant changes promptly.",
    "Auscultate lung sounds regularly to detect any changes, such as diminished or absent breath sounds, which may indicate atelectasis or other respiratory complications. Document findings accurately.",
    "Consider the use of mucolytics or bronchodilators if the client has excessive secretions or bronchospasm contributing to atelectasis. Consult with a respiratory therapist for appropriate interventions."

    "situation": "At 1400, the client is 2 days post-op from an open cholecystectomy and is reluctant to use the incentive spirometer.",
    "background": "The client is experiencing abdominal pain and has hypoactive bowel sounds, which are expected post-operative findings. However, the client is also exhibiting shallow respirations and reports sharp pain with deep inspiration.",

Administer pain medication as prescribed to facilitate deeper breathing. Consider a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis of atelectasis. Consult with a respiratory therapist for further evaluation and treatment. Monitor respiratory status closely, including oxygen saturation and breath sounds, and report any deterioration promptly."
