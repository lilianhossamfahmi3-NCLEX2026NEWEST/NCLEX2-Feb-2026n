    "prompt": "A 62-year-old female with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is brought to the emergency department by her daughter due to progressive lethargy and confusion over the past week. The daughter states the client stopped taking her levothyroxine 'a few months ago.' The nurse's assessment reveals a client who is difficult to arouse with puffy-appearing eyelids and non-pitting edema in her lower extremities. The nurse reviews the initial diagnostic data. For each clinical manifestation, select the underlying pathophysiological cause.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormones are essential for maintaining normal cardiovascular function. In severe hypothyroidism (myxedema), the lack of T3/T4 leads to decreased myocardial contractility, reduced stroke volume, and a blunted response to catecholamines. This results in bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, and subsequent hypotension."

                "columnId": "col-1",
                "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormone is a primary regulator of the basal metabolic rate (BMR). A profound deficiency drastically slows cellular metabolism, leading to decreased heat production (thermogenesis). This causes the hallmark sign of hypothermia in myxedema coma."

                "rationale": "Correct. Myxedema refers to the characteristic non-pitting edema seen in severe hypothyroidism. This occurs because of an accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) in the interstitial spaces, particularly the dermis. These substances attract water, leading to diffuse edema, facial puffiness, and a doughy skin texture."

                "columnId": "col-5",
                "rationale": "Correct. Neurological decline in myxedema coma is multifactorial. A key cause is hypoventilation (as evidenced by the slow, shallow respirations and low SpO2), which leads to carbon dioxide retention and cerebral hypoxia. Combined with reduced cerebral blood flow from hypotension, this results in altered mental status, ranging from lethargy to coma."

                "columnId": "col-4",
                "rationale": "Correct. Severe hypothyroidism can impair the kidney's ability to excrete free water. This can be due to a state resembling the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and decreased delivery of filtrate to the distal tubules. The resulting water retention leads to dilutional hyponatremia."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. This is not a primary pathophysiological mechanism in hypothyroidism. While metabolism is altered, a specific increase in peripheral glucose uptake is not the cause of the client's cardinal signs. Hypoglycemia can occur in myxedema coma, but it is typically due to impaired gluconeogenesis, not enhanced glucose uptake."
