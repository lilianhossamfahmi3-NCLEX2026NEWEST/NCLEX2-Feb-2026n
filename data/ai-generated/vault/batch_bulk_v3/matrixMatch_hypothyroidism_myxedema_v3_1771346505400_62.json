The daughter states the client stopped taking her levothyroxine 'a few months ago.' The nurse's assessment reveals a client who is difficult to arouse with puffy-appearing eyelids and non-pitting edema in her lower extremities. The nurse reviews the initial diagnostic data. For each clinical manifestation, select the underlying pathophysiological cause.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) are crucial for maintaining normal cardiovascular function. In severe hypothyroidism, as seen in myxedema coma, the deficiency of T3 and T4 leads to decreased myocardial contractility, reduced stroke volume, and a blunted response to catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This results in bradycardia (slow heart rate), decreased cardiac output, and subsequent hypotension (low blood pressure). The reduced cardiac output further compromises tissue perfusion.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormone is a primary regulator of the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy the body uses at rest. A profound deficiency of thyroid hormone drastically slows cellular metabolism, leading to decreased heat production (thermogenesis). This causes the hallmark sign of hypothermia (low body temperature) in myxedema coma. The body's ability to maintain a normal temperature is severely compromised.",

        "columnId": "col-2",
        "rationale": "Correct. Myxedema refers to the characteristic non-pitting edema seen in severe hypothyroidism. This occurs because of an accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans), such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, in the interstitial spaces, particularly the dermis. These substances attract and bind water, leading to diffuse edema, facial puffiness (especially around the eyes, causing periorbital edema), and a doughy skin texture. The edema is non-pitting because the accumulated substances prevent the fluid from being easily displaced.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Neurological decline in myxedema coma is multifactorial. A key cause is hypoventilation (as evidenced by the slow, shallow respirations and low SpO2), which leads to carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia) and cerebral hypoxia (oxygen deprivation in the brain). Combined with reduced cerebral blood flow from hypotension, this results in altered mental status, ranging from lethargy to coma. Hypothyroidism also directly affects brain function by reducing neuronal metabolism.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Severe hypothyroidism can impair the kidney's ability to excrete free water. This can be due to several mechanisms, including a state resembling the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), where ADH levels are inappropriately elevated, and decreased delivery of filtrate to the distal tubules, reducing the kidney's ability to dilute urine. The resulting water retention leads to dilutional hyponatremia (low sodium concentration in the blood).",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. This is not a primary pathophysiological mechanism in hypothyroidism. While metabolism is altered, a specific increase in peripheral glucose uptake is not the cause of the client's cardinal signs. Hypoglycemia can occur in myxedema coma, but it is typically due to impaired gluconeogenesis (the liver's ability to produce glucose), not enhanced glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. In fact, hypothyroidism can sometimes lead to insulin resistance.",

    "situation": "At 1400, a 62-year-old female with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis presents to the ED with progressive lethargy and confusion.",
    "background": "The patient's daughter reports that the client stopped taking her levothyroxine several months ago. Assessment reveals the patient is difficult to arouse, with periorbital edema and non-pitting edema in the lower extremities.",
    "assessment": "Vital signs: Temperature 95.2°F (35.1°C), Heart Rate 54/min, Blood Pressure 86/50 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 10/min and shallow, SpO2 88% on room air. Labs: TSH 150 mIU/L, Free T4 <0.4 ng/dL, Sodium 128 mEq/L. These findings are consistent with severe hypothyroidism/myxedema coma.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate interventions for myxedema coma, including IV levothyroxine administration, supportive care for hypothermia and hypotension (e.g., warming blankets, vasopressors if needed), and close monitoring for respiratory failure, with potential need for mechanical ventilation. Consider hydrocortisone for possible adrenal insufficiency."

  "clinicalPearls": [
    "Myxedema coma is a life-threatening endocrine emergency requiring prompt recognition and treatment with intravenous levothyroxine. Delay in treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.",
    "Hypothermia in myxedema coma may be profound; active external rewarming should be avoided initially as it can cause vasodilation and worsen hypotension. Passive rewarming with blankets is preferred.",
    "Monitor respiratory status closely and be prepared to provide mechanical ventilation if the client develops respiratory failure. Hypoventilation is a common and dangerous complication.",
    "Hyponatremia in myxedema coma is typically dilutional and should be managed with fluid restriction rather than sodium replacement, unless the sodium level is critically low (e.g., <120 mEq/L) or the patient is symptomatic. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.",
    "Consider other potential causes of altered mental status, such as infection, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances, even in the presence of known hypothyroidism. Rule out other conditions to ensure comprehensive care."
