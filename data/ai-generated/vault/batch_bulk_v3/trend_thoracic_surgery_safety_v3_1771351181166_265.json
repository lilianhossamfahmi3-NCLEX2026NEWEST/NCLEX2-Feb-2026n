        "correct": "The trend data demonstrates a classic progression of hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock. Key indicators include a consistent increase in heart rate (compensatory tachycardia), a steady decline in blood pressure (hypotension), and an increasing respiratory rate. Most significantly, the chest tube drainage has increased dramatically to over 200 mL/hr and has changed from serosanguineous to sanguineous (bright red), indicating active bleeding. The clinical signs of restlessness progressing to lethargy, and cool, clammy skin progressing to diaphoresis, are hallmark signs of decreased tissue perfusion due to significant volume loss.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are not supported by the constellation of signs and symptoms presented in the trend data. A tension pneumothorax would likely present with more severe, sudden respiratory distress, tracheal deviation, and absent breath sounds, not massive bloody drainage. Atelectasis and surgical site infection do not cause this rapid hemodynamic collapse. A pulmonary embolism would cause hypoxia and tachycardia but is not associated with excessive chest tube drainage.",
