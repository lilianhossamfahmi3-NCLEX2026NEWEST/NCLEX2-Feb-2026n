  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, current episode manic. The client is in the dayroom, speaking loudly and rapidly to other clients, pacing restlessly, and giving away personal belongings. The client has not eaten or slept for the past 24 hours. Which of the following nursing interventions are appropriate at this time? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The priority nursing interventions for a client experiencing acute mania focus on safety, physiological stability, and de-escalation. Providing high-calorie, portable foods addresses the client's increased metabolic needs and inability to sit for meals due to hyperactivity. Manic episodes are characterized by increased energy and decreased need for sleep, leading to potential nutritional deficits. Moving the client to a low-stimulus environment helps decrease agitation and prevents overstimulation, which can exacerbate manic symptoms. Sensory overload can trigger further escalation. Using firm, calm, and simple communication facilitates understanding for a client with flight of ideas and a short attention span, and it helps set necessary boundaries without escalating the situation. Clear communication reduces anxiety and promotes cooperation.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that can increase stimulation, lead to confrontation, or fail to address the client's escalating behavior are inappropriate and potentially unsafe. Encouraging group leadership is contraindicated as the client's grandiosity, poor impulse control, and racing thoughts would disrupt the group and overwhelm other clients. This could lead to increased agitation and potential conflict. Directly confronting the client about their behavior can be perceived as a threat, triggering agitation or aggression. Individuals in a manic state often have impaired judgment and are easily provoked. Ignoring the disruptive behavior and allowing continued pacing in a common area fails to maintain a safe and therapeutic milieu for both the client and others on the unit. This can create a chaotic environment and potentially lead to harm.",

        "rationale": "This action is inappropriate for a client in an acute manic state. Their grandiosity, racing thoughts, and poor social boundaries would make them disruptive and unable to therapeutically engage in or lead a group, potentially escalating their own symptoms and causing distress to other clients. A manic individual's impaired judgment and impulsivity make them unsuitable for leading a therapeutic group."

        "content": "Offer high-calorie, high-protein finger foods and drinks.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "This is a correct intervention. Clients with acute mania have increased metabolic demands due to hyperactivity and often cannot sit still for a meal. Portable, high-energy foods and drinks (e.g., sandwiches, cheese sticks, milkshakes) provide essential nutrition and hydration that can be consumed while moving. Mania increases energy expenditure, requiring frequent replenishment of calories and fluids to prevent dehydration and malnutrition."

        "content": "Allow the client to continue pacing in the dayroom to expend excess energy.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "This is incorrect because it fails to address the need for a safe, low-stimulus environment. While the client needs to expend energy, allowing them to do so in a stimulating common area can escalate their agitation and disturb other clients. The nurse's priority is to maintain a therapeutic and safe milieu. Uncontrolled pacing in a high-stimulus environment can lead to increased agitation and potential harm to the client and others."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "This is a correct intervention. A client experiencing mania is highly sensitive to environmental stimuli. Removing them from the stimulating dayroom to a quieter space, such as their room or a designated quiet room, helps to decrease sensory input, reduce agitation, and prevent escalation. Reducing environmental stimuli helps to calm the client and prevent further escalation of manic symptoms."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "This action is inappropriate at this time. Direct confrontation can be perceived as a challenge by a client with mania, leading to increased irritability and potential aggression. While limit-setting is important, it must be done in a non-confrontational manner. The immediate priority is de-escalation, not a power struggle over property. Confrontation can trigger aggression and should be avoided in the acute phase of mania."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "This is a correct communication strategy. The client's cognitive function is impaired by racing thoughts and a short attention span. Communicating in a clear, concise, and direct manner facilitates comprehension. A calm and firm tone conveys control and safety without being threatening. Simple language and a calm demeanor help the client process information and feel more secure."

    "recommendation": "Implement interventions to ensure the client's safety and physiological stability, including providing high-calorie finger foods, escorting the client to a quieter area, and using calm, firm, and simple communication. Contact the psychiatrist to review medication orders and consider adjusting the dosage or adding a PRN medication for agitation. Monitor vital signs, hydration status, and for escalation of symptoms and potential for aggression. Document all interventions and observations."
