    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 32-year-old client admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, current episode manic. The client is in the dayroom, speaking loudly and rapidly to other clients, pacing restlessly, and giving away personal belongings. The client has not eaten or slept for the past 24 hours. Which of the following nursing interventions are appropriate at this time? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The priority nursing interventions for a client experiencing acute mania focus on safety, physiological stability, and de-escalation. Providing high-calorie, portable foods addresses the client's increased metabolic needs and inability to sit for meals due to hyperactivity. Moving the client to a low-stimulus environment helps decrease agitation and prevents overstimulation, which can exacerbate manic symptoms. Using firm, calm, and simple communication facilitates understanding for a client with flight of ideas and a short attention span, and it helps set necessary boundaries without escalating the situation.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that can increase stimulation, lead to confrontation, or fail to address the client's escalating behavior are inappropriate and potentially unsafe. Encouraging group leadership is contraindicated as the client's grandiosity, poor impulse control, and racing thoughts would disrupt the group and overwhelm other clients. Directly confronting the client about their behavior can be perceived as a threat, triggering agitation or aggression. Ignoring the disruptive behavior and allowing continued pacing in a common area fails to maintain a safe and therapeutic milieu for both the client and others on the unit.",

                "rationale": "This is a correct intervention. A client experiencing mania is highly sensitive to environmental stimuli. Removing them from the stimulating dayroom to a quieter space, such as their room or a designated quiet room, helps to decrease sensory input, reduce agitation, and prevent escalation."

Direct confrontation can be perceived as a challenge by a client with mania, leading to increased irritability and potential aggression. While limit-setting is important, it must be done in a non-confrontational manner. The immediate priority is de-escalation, not a power struggle over property."

Communicating in a clear, concise, and direct manner facilitates comprehension. A calm and firm tone conveys control and safety without being threatening."
