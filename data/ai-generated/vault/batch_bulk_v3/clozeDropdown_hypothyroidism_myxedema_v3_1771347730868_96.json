    "question": "A 72-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism is admitted to the medical-surgical unit with suspected myxedema coma. The client is lethargic, responding only to painful stimuli. Her daughter states she has been non-adherent with her medication for several weeks. Vital signs are: T 34.5°C (94.1°F), HR 48/min, RR 10/min, BP 88/56 mmHg, SpO2 92% on room air. The nurse receives initial orders and contributes to the plan of care.\n\nThe nurse is preparing the initial interventions for the client. The nurse prepares to administer the prescribed thyroid hormone replacement. The initial priority route for levothyroxine administration is **[1]** and to closely monitor for cardiovascular changes, such as **[2]**. To address the client's fluid and electrolyte imbalance, the nurse will administer **[3]** and maintain **[4]**. For management of hypothermia, the nurse should initiate **[5]**.",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "1": {
            "intravenously": "Correct. In myxedema coma, there is profound gastrointestinal hypomotility and decreased absorption. Intravenous (IV) administration of levothyroxine is essential for rapid and reliable delivery to reverse the life-threatening hypothyroidism.",
            "orally": "Incorrect. Oral absorption is unpredictable and significantly delayed in myxedema coma due to paralytic ileus. This route is appropriate for stable, non-critical hypothyroidism but is ineffective in this emergency.",
            "subcutaneously": "Incorrect. Levothyroxine is not formulated or approved for subcutaneous administration. Absorption would be erratic and unreliable, especially with peripheral vasoconstriction from hypothermia.",
            "intramuscularly": "Incorrect. Intramuscular administration is not the standard of care for levothyroxine. Absorption can be slow and unpredictable, which is not suitable for a critical condition like myxedema coma."
        },
        "2": {
            "paradoxical hypertension": "Incorrect. The expected effect of treatment is an increase in blood pressure from the hypotensive state. While rapid changes can occur, the primary cardiovascular *risk* is not hypertension, but rather cardiac strain.",
            "angina or dysrhythmias": "Correct. Rapidly administering levothyroxine increases metabolic rate and myocardial oxygen demand. In an older adult, this can unmask or exacerbate underlying coronary artery disease, leading to angina, myocardial infarction, or tachyarrhythmias. This is a critical adverse effect to monitor for.",
            "worsening bradycardia": "Incorrect. The pathophysiology of myxedema involves severe bradycardia. Thyroid hormone replacement will increase heart rate; therefore, worsening bradycardia would indicate treatment failure, not a side effect of the intervention.",
            "a widened pulse pressure": "Incorrect. A widened pulse pressure is not a primary or specific adverse effect of levothyroxine administration. While blood pressure will change, the most significant risk is related to increased cardiac workload."
        },
        "3": {
            "0.45% sodium chloride": "Incorrect. This is a hypotonic solution which would provide free water and worsen the dilutional hyponatremia often seen in myxedema coma (due to decreased free water clearance).",
            "dextrose 5% in water (D5W)": "Incorrect. D5W is an isotonic solution in the bag, but the dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving free water. This would severely exacerbate the hyponatremia.",
            "hypertonic saline": "Correct. Myxedema coma is associated with a state similar to SIADH, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. With altered mental status, this is considered severe, symptomatic hyponatremia, which requires careful administration of hypertonic saline (e.g., 3% NaCl) to raise the serum sodium level safely.",
            "strict fluid restriction only": "Incorrect. While fluid restriction is a component of managing the hyponatremia, it is often insufficient and too slow for a patient with a significantly decreased level of consciousness. Active correction with hypertonic saline is indicated."
        },
        "4": {
            "the head of the bed flat to improve cerebral perfusion": "Incorrect. Keeping the head of the bed flat in a client with a decreased level of consciousness increases the risk of airway obstruction and aspiration. The head of the bed should be elevated.",
            "continuous pulse oximetry and have intubation equipment readily available": "Correct. Myxedema coma leads to respiratory muscle weakness, decreased central respiratory drive, and potential airway obstruction from an edematous tongue. This client's bradypnea and lethargy place them at extremely high risk for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and preparation for mechanical ventilation are essential safety measures.",
            "a high-flow nasal cannula at 40 L/min": "Incorrect. While supplemental oxygen may be needed, simply applying it without a full respiratory assessment is insufficient. The primary problem is often hypoventilation (inadequate breathing), not just oxygenation. High-flow oxygen can mask rising CO2 levels, giving a false sense of security.",
            "hourly neurological checks as the sole respiratory assessment": "Incorrect. Neurological checks are vital, but they are not a direct assessment of respiratory status. A direct respiratory assessment, including rate, depth, effort, and continuous monitoring, is required due to the high risk of respiratory failure."
        },
        "5": {
            "active rewarming with a forced-air warming blanket": "Incorrect. Active external rewarming is contraindicated in myxedema coma. It can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a precipitous drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse before the underlying metabolic issue is corrected.",
            "passive rewarming with blankets": "Correct. The standard of care is passive rewarming. This involves covering the patient with warm blankets in a warm room to prevent further heat loss and allow the core temperature to rise slowly as the metabolic rate increases with thyroid hormone treatment. This method avoids the risk of vasodilation and hypotension.",
            "administration of warmed intravenous fluids": "Incorrect. While warmed IV fluids can be part of a rewarming strategy, they are a form of active *core* rewarming, not the primary or sole intervention. Passive rewarming is the priority. Furthermore, fluid administration must be cautious due to hyponatremia and potential heart failure.",
            "immersion of extremities in warm water": "Incorrect. This is a form of active rewarming that is impractical for a critically ill patient and carries the same significant risk of causing peripheral vasodilation and cardiovascular collapse."
