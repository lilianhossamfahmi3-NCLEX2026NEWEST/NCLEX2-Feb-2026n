  "question": "A 72-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism is admitted to the medical-surgical unit at 1400 with suspected myxedema coma. The client is lethargic, responding only to painful stimuli. Her daughter states she has been non-adherent with her medication for several weeks. Vital signs are: T 34.5°C (94.1°F), HR 48/min, RR 10/min, BP 88/56 mmHg, SpO2 92% on room air. The nurse receives initial orders and contributes to the plan of care.\n\nThe nurse is preparing the initial interventions for the client. The nurse prepares to administer the prescribed thyroid hormone replacement. The initial priority route for levothyroxine administration is **[1]** and to closely monitor for cardiovascular changes, such as **[2]**. To address the client's fluid and electrolyte imbalance, the nurse will administer **[3]** and maintain **[4]**. For management of hypothermia, the nurse should initiate **[5]**.",

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "1": {
      "intravenously": "Correct (+). In myxedema coma, severe gastrointestinal hypomotility impairs absorption. IV levothyroxine ensures rapid and reliable delivery to reverse life-threatening hypothyroidism. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for improvement in vital signs and mental status after administration.",
      "orally": "Incorrect (-). Oral absorption is unpredictable and delayed in myxedema coma due to paralytic ileus. This route is ineffective in this emergency.",
      "subcutaneously": "Incorrect (-). Levothyroxine is not formulated for subcutaneous administration. Absorption would be erratic, especially with peripheral vasoconstriction.",
      "intramuscularly": "Incorrect (-). IM administration is not standard for levothyroxine. Absorption can be slow and unpredictable, unsuitable for myxedema coma."
    },
    "2": {
      "paradoxical hypertension": "Incorrect (-). While blood pressure will increase, the primary cardiovascular *risk* is cardiac strain, not hypertension.",
      "angina or dysrhythmias": "Correct (+). Rapid levothyroxine administration increases metabolic rate and myocardial oxygen demand. This can unmask or exacerbate underlying coronary artery disease, leading to angina, myocardial infarction, or tachyarrhythmias. Pathophysiology: Increased thyroid hormone acutely increases beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity in the heart, increasing heart rate and contractility. This increased workload can precipitate ischemia in patients with pre-existing CAD. Clinical Pearl: Have cardiac monitoring and medications (e.g., beta-blockers) readily available.",
      "worsening bradycardia": "Incorrect (-). Myxedema involves severe bradycardia. Thyroid hormone replacement will increase heart rate; worsening bradycardia indicates treatment failure.",
      "a widened pulse pressure": "Incorrect (-). A widened pulse pressure is not a primary or specific adverse effect of levothyroxine administration."
    },
    "3": {
      "0.45% sodium chloride": "Incorrect (-). This hypotonic solution provides free water and worsens dilutional hyponatremia. Pathophysiology: Myxedema coma causes decreased free water clearance due to impaired renal function and increased ADH secretion.",
      "dextrose 5% in water (D5W)": "Incorrect (-). D5W is an isotonic solution in the bag, but the dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving free water, exacerbating hyponatremia.",
      "hypertonic saline": "Correct (+). Myxedema coma is associated with dilutional hyponatremia. With altered mental status, this is severe, symptomatic hyponatremia, requiring careful administration of hypertonic saline (e.g., 3% NaCl) to raise serum sodium safely. Pathophysiology: Hypertonic saline increases the serum osmolality, drawing water out of the cells and increasing the serum sodium concentration. Clinical Pearl: Administer slowly and monitor sodium levels frequently to avoid overly rapid correction, which can lead to central pontine myelinolysis.",
      "strict fluid restriction only": "Incorrect (-). While fluid restriction is a component, it is often insufficient and too slow for a patient with decreased level of consciousness. Active correction with hypertonic saline is indicated."
    },
    "4": {
      "the head of the bed flat to improve cerebral perfusion": "Incorrect (-). Keeping the head of the bed flat increases the risk of airway obstruction and aspiration. The head of the bed should be elevated.",
      "continuous pulse oximetry and have intubation equipment readily available": "Correct (+). Myxedema coma leads to respiratory muscle weakness, decreased central respiratory drive, and potential airway obstruction from an edematous tongue. This client's bradypnea and lethargy place them at extremely high risk for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and preparation for mechanical ventilation are essential safety measures. Pathophysiology: Hypothyroidism causes decreased sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, leading to hypoventilation. Edema of the tongue and upper airway can also contribute to airway obstruction. Clinical Pearl: Anticipate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
      "a high-flow nasal cannula at 40 L/min": "Incorrect (-). While supplemental oxygen may be needed, simply applying it without a full respiratory assessment is insufficient. The primary problem is often hypoventilation. High-flow oxygen can mask rising CO2 levels.",
      "hourly neurological checks as the sole respiratory assessment": "Incorrect (-). Neurological checks are vital, but they are not a direct assessment of respiratory status. A direct respiratory assessment is required due to the high risk of respiratory failure."
    },
    "5": {
      "active rewarming with a forced-air warming blanket": "Incorrect (-). Active external rewarming is contraindicated in myxedema coma. It can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a precipitous drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse. Pathophysiology: Peripheral vasodilation shunts blood away from the core, exacerbating hypothermia and hypotension.",
      "passive rewarming with blankets": "Correct (+). The standard of care is passive rewarming. This involves covering the patient with warm blankets in a warm room to prevent further heat loss and allow the core temperature to rise slowly as the metabolic rate increases with thyroid hormone treatment. This method avoids the risk of vasodilation and hypotension. Clinical Pearl: Monitor blood pressure closely during rewarming.",
      "administration of warmed intravenous fluids": "Incorrect (-). While warmed IV fluids can be part of a rewarming strategy, they are a form of active *core* rewarming, not the primary intervention. Passive rewarming is the priority. Furthermore, fluid administration must be cautious due to hyponatremia and potential heart failure.",
      "immersion of extremities in warm water": "Incorrect (-). This is a form of active rewarming that is impractical for a critically ill patient and carries the same significant risk of causing peripheral vasodilation and cardiovascular collapse."
