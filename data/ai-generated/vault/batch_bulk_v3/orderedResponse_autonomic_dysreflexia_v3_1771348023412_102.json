  "stem": "A 28-year-old client with a T4 spinal cord injury, located in room 177, suddenly complains of a severe, pounding headache. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following: BP 210/118 mmHg, heart rate 48/min, profuse diaphoresis on the forehead and neck, and flushed skin above the chest. The client's skin below the level of injury is cool and pale. The nurse recognizes the client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag the actions into the box on the right to arrange them in the correct order of priority, from first to last.",

      "order": 1,
      "rationale": "Raising the head of the bed to a 90-degree angle (high Fowler's position) is the priority action. This utilizes gravity to induce orthostatic hypotension, which helps to immediately lower the client's dangerously elevated blood pressure. The rapid decrease in BP reduces the risk of life-threatening complications such as stroke, seizure, or myocardial infarction. Autonomic dysreflexia causes an exaggerated sympathetic response below the level of the spinal cord injury due to a noxious stimulus. This leads to vasoconstriction and a surge in blood pressure. \n\nClinical Pearl: Rapidly lowering the blood pressure is critical to prevent end-organ damage. High Fowler's position is a simple, non-invasive intervention that can quickly improve the client's condition.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Elevating the head of the bed is a crucial initial step in managing autonomic dysreflexia. It leverages gravity to reduce blood pressure and minimize the risk of severe complications."

    "opt-4": {
      "order": 2,
      "rationale": "Loosening tight clothing and abdominal binders is the next priority. These items can act as noxious stimuli, exacerbating the autonomic dysreflexia response. Removing these external constrictions helps to reduce the afferent input triggering the sympathetic surge. The pathophysiology involves an uninhibited sympathetic response below the level of the spinal cord injury. By removing potential triggers, the nurse aims to interrupt the cycle of vasoconstriction and hypertension.\n\nClinical Pearl: Even seemingly minor constrictions can significantly contribute to the hypertensive crisis in autonomic dysreflexia. A thorough assessment for and removal of such stimuli is essential.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Tight clothing or abdominal binders can exacerbate autonomic dysreflexia by acting as noxious stimuli. Promptly loosening these items can contribute to a reduction in blood pressure."
    },
    "opt-1": {
      "order": 3,
      "rationale": "Assessing for a kinked urinary catheter and palpating for bladder distention is the third priority. Bladder distention is the most common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia. The distended bladder sends afferent signals to the spinal cord, triggering the exaggerated sympathetic response. If a kink is present, the catheter should be immediately straightened. If bladder distention is present and a catheter is not, catheterization may be necessary (per provider order). This action aims to identify and eliminate the primary cause of the autonomic dysreflexia.\n\nClinical Pearl: A full bladder is a potent stimulus for autonomic dysreflexia. Prompt identification and relief of bladder distention are crucial for resolving the episode.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Bladder distention is a frequent cause of autonomic dysreflexia. A thorough assessment of the urinary catheter and bladder is essential to identify and address this trigger."
    },
    "opt-3": {
      "order": 4,
      "rationale": "Administering PRN nifedipine 10 mg sublingually as prescribed is the fourth priority. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that causes vasodilation, helping to lower blood pressure. It is used when non-pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to control the hypertensive crisis. The medication works by blocking calcium influx into smooth muscle cells, leading to relaxation and vasodilation. This reduces peripheral vascular resistance and lowers blood pressure. The sublingual route allows for rapid absorption and onset of action.\n\nClinical Pearl: Nifedipine is a rapid-acting antihypertensive agent that can effectively manage the hypertensive crisis associated with autonomic dysreflexia. Monitor blood pressure closely after administration.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Nifedipine, administered sublingually, is a rapid-acting antihypertensive medication commonly used to manage the hypertensive crisis associated with autonomic dysreflexia when non-pharmacological interventions are insufficient."

    "opt-2": {
      "order": 5,
      "rationale": "Notifying the on-call healthcare provider is the final priority. While important for communication and further orders, it should occur after the nurse has initiated immediate interventions to stabilize the client. The nurse should be prepared to provide a concise report of the client's condition, interventions performed, and the client's response. This ensures that the provider has the necessary information to make informed decisions about further management. The nurse should report the vital signs, interventions, and client response to the provider.\n\nClinical Pearl: Timely communication with the healthcare provider is essential, but it should not delay the implementation of immediate, life-saving interventions.",
      "clinicalPearl": "While notifying the healthcare provider is important, it should follow the implementation of immediate interventions to stabilize the client and address the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia."

Skin below the injury is cool and pale.",
    "background": "The client has a history of T4 spinal cord injury. Autonomic dysreflexia is a known complication of spinal cord injuries above T6, triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of the injury.",

    "recommendation": "I recommend the following actions: Immediately elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees, loosen any tight clothing, assess for bladder distention or a kinked catheter. I have a PRN order for nifedipine 10 mg sublingually and will administer if BP remains elevated after these interventions. I will continue to monitor vital signs every 5 minutes. Please advise if further intervention is needed."
