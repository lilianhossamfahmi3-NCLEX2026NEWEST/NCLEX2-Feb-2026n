The nurse assesses the client and notes the following: BP 210/118 mmHg, heart rate 48/min, profuse diaphoresis on the forehead and neck, and flushed skin above the chest. The client's skin below the level of injury is cool and pale. The nurse recognizes the client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag the actions into the box on the right to arrange them in the correct order of priority, from first to last.",
