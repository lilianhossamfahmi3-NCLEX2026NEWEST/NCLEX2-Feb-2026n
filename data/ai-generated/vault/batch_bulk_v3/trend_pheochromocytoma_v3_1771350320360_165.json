        "rationale": "The client's standing blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg on Day 3, compared to 206/115 mmHg on Day 1, indicates significant orthostatic hypotension. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, inhibits the vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) released by the pheochromocytoma. This vasodilation reduces blood pressure, but can lead to postural hypotension, especially upon standing. The drop in blood pressure decreases cerebral perfusion, causing dizziness and increasing the risk of falls. This finding necessitates immediate nursing interventions, such as implementing fall precautions and educating the client on how to change positions slowly.",

Instruct clients to change positions slowly, especially from lying to standing, to minimize dizziness and prevent falls.

Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines. Metanephrines are metabolites of catecholamines, and their elevated levels in the urine are highly specific for diagnosing this condition. This finding is crucial because it validates the need for continued alpha-adrenergic blockade to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises before surgical removal of the tumor.",

Metanephrines are metabolites of these catecholamines. Elevated levels in the urine confirm excessive catecholamine production, supporting the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma."

As the medication blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors, blood vessels dilate, and the body's ability to compensate for positional changes is impaired. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure upon standing, resulting in reduced cerebral perfusion and subsequent dizziness. This subjective symptom, coupled with the objective finding of orthostatic hypotension, indicates a need for immediate nursing intervention to prevent falls and ensure client safety.",
