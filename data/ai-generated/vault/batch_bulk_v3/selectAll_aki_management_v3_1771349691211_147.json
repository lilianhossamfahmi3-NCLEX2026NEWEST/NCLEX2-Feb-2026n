The client exhibits signs of fluid overload, including +2 pitting edema and crackles in the lungs, coupled with oliguria (urine output of 100 mL in 8 hours). AKI impairs the kidneys' ability to excrete fluid, leading to fluid retention. Increasing the IV rate would exacerbate hypervolemia, potentially leading to pulmonary edema and further compromising respiratory function. This action could also worsen hypertension and increase the risk of heart failure.",

Restricting potassium intake helps lower serum potassium levels, reducing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Limiting protein intake reduces the production of nitrogenous waste products (BUN), alleviating the workload on the kidneys and minimizing further increases in BUN and creatinine. A low-sodium diet also aids in managing fluid retention and hypertension.",

With a potassium level of 6.1 mEq/L, the client is experiencing hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and ultimately, cardiac arrest. Administering Kayexalate is a priority intervention to rapidly lower potassium levels and stabilize cardiac function. The medication works by exchanging sodium ions for potassium ions in the intestine, effectively removing potassium from the body.",

The client's irregular heart rate further emphasizes the need for continuous cardiac monitoring to promptly detect and manage any life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, and eventual loss of P waves. Early detection allows for timely interventions to prevent cardiac arrest.",

      "rationale": "Metformin is primarily excreted by the kidneys. In the setting of AKI (Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL), renal clearance of metformin is significantly reduced, leading to its accumulation in the body. This accumulation increases the risk of lactic acidosis, a serious and potentially fatal metabolic complication. Lactic acidosis is characterized by a buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream, leading to a decrease in pH and impaired cellular function. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hyperventilation, and altered mental status. Therefore, metformin is contraindicated in clients with AKI and should be withheld to prevent lactic acidosis.",

      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can worsen AKI by reducing glomerular filtration pressure. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation of the efferent arteriole in the glomerulus. This reduces intraglomerular pressure and can decrease GFR, further impairing kidney function. Additionally, ACE inhibitors can cause hyperkalemia by reducing aldosterone production, which normally promotes potassium excretion. Given the client's existing hyperkalemia (K+ 6.1 mEq/L), administering lisinopril could exacerbate this electrolyte imbalance and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The nurse should question this order with the provider.",

Lab results show potassium 6.1 mEq/L, sodium 134 mEq/L, BUN 78 mg/dL, and creatinine 4.2 mg/dL.

I also recommend clarifying the order for lisinopril with the provider due to the risk of worsening AKI and hyperkalemia. Consider a fluid challenge to assess renal responsiveness, if appropriate, after addressing hyperkalemia."

Remember the mnemonic 'K-SAVE' for hyperkalemia treatment: Kayexalate, Sodium bicarbonate, Albuterol, Volume (fluids), Excretion (diuretics/dialysis). Always question nephrotoxic medications and adjust dosages based on renal function.",
