    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes client safety and follows the nursing process. First, assess the client (C) to establish a baseline and identify immediate threats. Next, withhold the lithium (E) to prevent further absorption and worsening toxicity. Then, initiate cardiac monitoring (B) due to lithium's potential cardiovascular effects. Follow with IV fluids (A) to promote lithium excretion. Finally, draw blood for a lithium level (D) to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.",
    "incorrect": "Any other order deviates from established prioritization frameworks and could delay critical interventions. For example, drawing blood first delays assessment and interventions. Starting IV fluids without assessment and cardiac monitoring could be harmful. Failing to withhold lithium immediately worsens the toxicity.",

      "background": "Client has a history of bipolar I disorder and is currently prescribed lithium carbonate. Hydrochlorothiazide was recently added. Symptoms developed over the past 24 hours.",
      "assessment": "Client presents with altered mental status (confusion), coarse hand tremors, and ataxia. Vital signs are: HR 55, BP 90/60, RR 12, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F), SpO2 98% on room air. Neurological assessment reveals decreased level of consciousness.",
      "recommendation": "Initiate cardiac monitoring, withhold lithium, establish IV access for fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride, and obtain a stat serum lithium level. Consider potential need for hemodialysis based on lithium level and clinical status."
    },
    "clinicalPearls": "Thiazide diuretics (like hydrochlorothiazide) can increase lithium levels by decreasing renal clearance. Monitor lithium levels closely when starting or adjusting diuretic dosages. Early signs of lithium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle weakness. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, coma, and death. Hydration status significantly impacts lithium levels; dehydration increases the risk of toxicity.",
    "pathophysiologyRationale": "Lithium is a mood-stabilizing drug with a narrow therapeutic index. Lithium toxicity occurs when serum lithium levels exceed the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, reduces sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. This leads to increased sodium and water excretion, which can cause dehydration and decreased renal perfusion. In response to decreased sodium levels, the kidneys increase reabsorption of sodium and lithium in the proximal tubule, leading to increased serum lithium levels and potential toxicity. Lithium affects multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular system, and kidneys. CNS effects include altered mental status, tremors, ataxia, and seizures. Cardiovascular effects include bradycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypotension. Renal effects include polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
