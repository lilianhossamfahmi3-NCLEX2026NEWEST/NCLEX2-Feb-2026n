The first action is always to assess the client to establish a baseline and identify immediate life threats. Next, the nurse must prevent further harm by withholding the offending agent. Then, interventions addressing circulation (cardiac monitoring) and promoting excretion (IV fluids) are initiated. Finally, obtaining a diagnostic lab value confirms the diagnosis and guides further treatment decisions, such as hemodialysis.",

For example, drawing blood first delays immediate assessment and life-sustaining interventions. Starting IV fluids before a thorough assessment and cardiac monitoring could be hazardous if the client has underlying cardiac or renal compromise that has not yet been identified. Failing to withhold the lithium dose as a top priority would worsen the client's condition.",
