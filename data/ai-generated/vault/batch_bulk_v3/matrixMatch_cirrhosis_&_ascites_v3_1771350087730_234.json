    "correct": "The nurse correctly evaluates the client's response to treatment by integrating physical assessment findings and laboratory results. Lactulose was effective, as evidenced by improved mental status and decreased ammonia levels. Paracentesis was effective, as shown by reduced weight and abdominal girth. However, spironolactone, furosemide, and the sodium-restricted diet require further action. Spironolactone led to life-threatening hyperkalemia. Furosemide contributed to acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/creatinine), a sign of hepatorenal syndrome. The sodium restriction, in the context of diuretic use, has resulted in significant hyponatremia, which requires re-evaluation of fluid and sodium management.",
    "incorrect": "An incorrect evaluation would fail to recognize the adverse effects of the diuretic therapy and diet. For example, classifying spironolactone as effective ignores the critical hyperkalemia. Classifying furosemide as effective ignores the worsening renal function. Classifying the 2-gram sodium diet as effective overlooks the severe hyponatremia, a dangerous electrolyte imbalance. Correctly evaluating outcomes requires a comprehensive analysis of all data, not just the desired effects.",

In cirrhosis, ascites results from portal hypertension and decreased oncotic pressure. The large-volume paracentesis successfully removed ascitic fluid, as evidenced by a 4 kg weight loss and a 7 cm reduction in abdominal girth.

In clients with cirrhosis, aggressive diuresis with loop diuretics like furosemide can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome, a life-threatening complication characterized by acute kidney injury.

While sodium restriction is a cornerstone of ascites management to reduce fluid retention, the client has developed significant hyponatremia (124 mEq/L). This dilutional hyponatremia is common in advanced cirrhosis due to impaired water excretion and increased ADH levels, and can be exacerbated by diuretics. This severe electrolyte imbalance requires provider notification and a potential change in the plan, such as initiating a fluid restriction (e.g., 1000-1500 mL/day) and potentially discontinuing or reducing the dose of diuretics.",

A: Today at 0800, the client is alert and oriented x3, reports feeling less bloated, no asterixis, respirations unlabored at 18/min. Weight decreased from 90 kg to 86 kg, abdominal girth decreased from 115 cm to 108 cm. Sodium decreased from 130 mEq/L to 124 mEq/L, potassium increased from 3.6 mEq/L to 5.8 mEq/L, BUN increased from 25 mg/dL to 35 mg/dL, creatinine increased from 1.3 mg/dL to 2.5 mg/dL, ammonia decreased from 95 mcg/dL to 40 mcg/dL. Paracentesis (4L removed) completed yesterday at 1400. R: Based on the client's current lab values and assessment findings, the spironolactone and furosemide should be held, and the provider notified immediately due to hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. The sodium restriction should be re-evaluated due to hyponatremia. Consider a fluid restriction.",

Be vigilant for signs of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hepatorenal syndrome. Adjustments to diuretic therapy and sodium restriction may be necessary based on the client's response.
