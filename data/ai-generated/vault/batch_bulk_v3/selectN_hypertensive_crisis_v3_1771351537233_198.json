    "question": "A 68-year-old client with a history of poorly controlled hypertension presents to the emergency department with a blood pressure of 228/132 mmHg, a severe occipital headache, and blurred vision. The healthcare provider diagnoses a hypertensive emergency and prescribes a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "opt_1": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside is a photosensitive medication that degrades when exposed to light. This degradation reduces its efficacy and can lead to the formation of toxic byproducts, including cyanide. The IV bag and tubing must be covered with an opaque material, typically provided by the pharmacy, to ensure medication stability and patient safety."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent and fast-acting vasodilator, causing rapid changes in blood pressure. Frequent monitoring, typically every 5 to 15 minutes, is essential during initial administration and titration to prevent profound hypotension and ensure the therapeutic goal for blood pressure reduction is safely met."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The goal in a hypertensive emergency is a controlled, gradual reduction of blood pressure to prevent organ hypoperfusion, particularly cerebral, coronary, and renal ischemia. A rapid 50% reduction in MAP is dangerous. The standard guideline is to lower MAP by no more than 20-25% within the first hour, and then gradually lower the BP further over the next 24-48 hours."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Due to its potency and the need for precise dose titration, sodium nitroprusside must be administered via an electronic infusion pump. This ensures a controlled and accurate delivery rate, minimizing the risk of accidental overdose or underdose, which could lead to severe hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, respectively."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Rapid blood pressure reduction and the effects of potent vasodilators can precipitate cardiac ischemia or dysrhythmias, especially in a client with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Continuous cardiac monitoring is a critical safety measure to immediately detect and manage any adverse cardiac events."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. A client in a hypertensive emergency receiving a potent IV antihypertensive requires strict bed rest. Ambulation would increase cardiovascular workload and poses a significant safety risk due to potential dizziness, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension caused by the rapid-acting vasodilator."
