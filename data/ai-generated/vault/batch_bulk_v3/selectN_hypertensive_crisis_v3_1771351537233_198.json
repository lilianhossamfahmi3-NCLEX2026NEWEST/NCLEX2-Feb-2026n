  "question": "A 68-year-old client with a history of poorly controlled hypertension presents to the emergency department at 14:00 with a blood pressure of 228/132 mmHg, a severe occipital headache, and blurred vision. The healthcare provider diagnoses a hypertensive emergency and prescribes a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "opt_1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside is highly photosensitive and undergoes degradation when exposed to light. This degradation leads to decreased efficacy and the formation of toxic byproducts, including cyanide. Protecting the IV bag and tubing with an opaque cover (usually provided by the pharmacy) is crucial to maintain drug stability and prevent potential cyanide toxicity. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Light exposure causes nitroprusside to break down, releasing cyanide ions. The body can detoxify small amounts of cyanide, but prolonged exposure or rapid breakdown can overwhelm the detoxification mechanisms, leading to cyanide toxicity. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always check the IV nitroprusside solution for discoloration (should be faint brown). Discard if deeply colored, as this indicates degradation.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent, rapid-acting vasodilator that can cause precipitous drops in blood pressure. Frequent blood pressure monitoring (every 5-15 minutes) during initial titration is essential to detect and manage hypotension promptly. This allows for precise adjustments to the infusion rate to achieve the target blood pressure reduction safely.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Nitroprusside works by releasing nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells. This leads to increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, causing vasodilation and a rapid decrease in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Have vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine, phenylephrine) readily available in case of severe hypotension.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Rapidly reducing MAP by 50% in the first hour can lead to dangerous hypoperfusion of vital organs, particularly the brain, heart, and kidneys. The recommended approach is a gradual reduction of MAP by no more than 20-25% within the first hour, followed by further gradual reduction over the next 24-48 hours to a safer target blood pressure.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** In chronic hypertension, the cerebral autoregulation curve shifts to the right, meaning the brain requires a higher MAP to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow. A rapid reduction in MAP can drop cerebral perfusion pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation, leading to cerebral ischemia and stroke.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of neurological deficits (e.g., altered mental status, weakness) during blood pressure reduction, which may indicate cerebral hypoperfusion.",
      "correct": false
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside requires precise dose titration to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction without causing severe hypotension. An electronic infusion pump ensures accurate and controlled delivery of the medication, minimizing the risk of accidental boluses or inconsistent infusion rates.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Nitroprusside has a very short half-life (about 2 minutes), meaning its effects are rapidly reversible. Precise control over the infusion rate is crucial to maintain a stable blood pressure within the therapeutic range.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Double-check the pump settings and infusion rate with another nurse before initiating the infusion and with each rate change.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "rationale": "Correct. Rapid blood pressure reduction and the vasodilatory effects of nitroprusside can precipitate cardiac ischemia or dysrhythmias, especially in clients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection and management of any adverse cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Nitroprusside-induced vasodilation can decrease coronary perfusion pressure, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Additionally, rapid changes in blood pressure can trigger reflex tachycardia or other arrhythmias.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the ECG for ST-segment changes, T-wave inversions, or new arrhythmias. Report any changes to the healthcare provider immediately.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. A client in a hypertensive emergency receiving a potent IV antihypertensive requires strict bed rest to minimize the risk of falls and orthostatic hypotension. Ambulation can exacerbate hypotension and increase the risk of syncope due to the rapid-acting vasodilator.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Nitroprusside causes peripheral vasodilation, which reduces venous return to the heart. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and orthostatic hypotension, especially when the client changes position.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Instruct the client to call for assistance before getting out of bed, even after the nitroprusside infusion is discontinued. Assess for orthostatic hypotension before allowing the client to ambulate.",
