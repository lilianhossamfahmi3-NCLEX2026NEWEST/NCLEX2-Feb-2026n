    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 45-year-old client with a T4 spinal cord injury who was admitted for a urinary tract infection. The client suddenly reports a severe, pounding headache. The nurse assesses the client and notes profuse diaphoresis on the forehead, flushed skin above the T4 level, and piloerection. The client's vital signs are: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 48/min, RR 20/min, SpO2 98% on room air.",
    "question": "The nurse recognizes the client is most likely experiencing the condition in the box on the left. Based on this condition, what are the **two** actions the nurse should take to address the condition and what are the **two** parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client's progress?",

    "correct": "The client's presentation (sudden severe hypertension, bradycardia, pounding headache, diaphoresis, flushed skin above T4, piloerection) strongly suggests Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD). AD is a medical emergency unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6, triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury. The pathophysiology involves an uninhibited sympathetic response causing vasoconstriction and a surge in blood pressure. The brain attempts to compensate via the vagus nerve, resulting in bradycardia. Immediate interventions are crucial to prevent stroke, seizure, or death. Elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees (0000) promotes orthostatic hypotension, reducing BP. Assessing for and alleviating common triggers like bladder distention or fecal impaction is paramount. Continuous BP and HR monitoring are essential to evaluate intervention effectiveness.",
    "incorrect": "Spinal shock presents with hypotension and flaccidity. Neurogenic shock causes hypotension and bradycardia due to vasodilation. Pulmonary embolism typically involves respiratory distress and tachycardia. Malignant hyperthermia is characterized by hyperthermia and muscle rigidity. Placing the client supine worsens hypertension. Antihypertensives are secondary to stimulus removal. Fluid boluses exacerbate hypertension. Temperature, respiratory rate, and urine specific gravity are not primary indicators of AD resolution.",
