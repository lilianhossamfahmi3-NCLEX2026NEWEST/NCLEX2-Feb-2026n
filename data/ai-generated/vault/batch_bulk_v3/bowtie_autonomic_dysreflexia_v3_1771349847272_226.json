The nurse assesses the client and notes profuse diaphoresis on the forehead, flushed skin above the T4 level, and piloerection. The client's vital signs are: BP 210/110 mmHg, HR 48/min, RR 20/min, SpO2 98% on room air.",

        "correct": "The client's presentation of sudden severe hypertension (210/110 mmHg), bradycardia (48/min), pounding headache, diaphoresis, and flushed skin above the level of the T4 spinal cord injury are classic signs of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD). This is a medical emergency triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of injury. The priority actions are to immediately sit the client upright (elevate HOB to 90 degrees) to induce orthostatic hypotension and lower the BP, and simultaneously search for and remove the underlying cause, most commonly bladder distention or fecal impaction. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and prevent complications such as stroke or seizure.",
        "incorrect": "Other conditions are less likely. Spinal and neurogenic shock are characterized by hypotension and bradycardia, not severe hypertension. A pulmonary embolism typically presents with tachycardia and respiratory symptoms. Malignant hyperthermia involves high fever and muscle rigidity, which are not present. Incorrect actions would either worsen the condition (placing supine, IV fluid bolus) or are not the first-line intervention (administering antihypertensives before removing the stimulus). Monitoring parameters like temperature, respiratory rate, or urine specific gravity are not the primary indicators for assessing the resolution of this acute hemodynamic crisis.",
