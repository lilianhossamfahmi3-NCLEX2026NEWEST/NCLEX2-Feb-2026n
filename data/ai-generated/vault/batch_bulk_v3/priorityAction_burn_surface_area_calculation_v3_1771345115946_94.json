        "correct": "The client's presentation with a hoarse voice, soot around the nares and mouth, and singed nasal hair are classic signs of a significant inhalation injury. Hoarseness indicates laryngeal edema, which can rapidly progress to complete airway obstruction. According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, the immediate priority is to address this life-threatening airway and breathing issue. Administering 100% humidified oxygen via a non-rebreather mask maximizes oxygenation, helps displace potential carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, and is the first step in managing a compromised airway while preparing for definitive airway management, such as intubation.",
        "incorrect": "While the other actions are essential components of burn management, they are not the most immediate priority. The ABC framework dictates that securing the airway and ensuring adequate oxygenation takes precedence over circulation (IV access, TBSA calculation for fluids), assessment (vital signs), and exposure/decontamination (removing clothing). A compromised airway is the most immediate threat to life in this scenario.",
