    "correct": "The client's presentation (hoarse voice, soot around nares/mouth, singed nasal hair) indicates a significant inhalation injury and potential airway compromise due to laryngeal edema. This can rapidly lead to airway obstruction. Per the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, the immediate priority is airway and breathing. Administering 100% humidified oxygen via a non-rebreather mask maximizes oxygen delivery, helps displace carbon monoxide, and supports oxygenation while preparing for definitive airway management (e.g., intubation). Inhalation injuries cause inflammation and edema in the upper airway. Soot and chemical irritants damage the mucosa, leading to increased capillary permeability and fluid extravasation. This results in swelling that can obstruct airflow. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with a much higher affinity than oxygen, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. High-flow oxygen helps to overcome this. Clinical Pearl: Early intubation is crucial in suspected inhalation injuries, as airway edema can progress rapidly, making later intubation difficult or impossible.",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are important in burn management, they are not the immediate priority. The ABC framework prioritizes airway and breathing over circulation (IV access, TBSA calculation), assessment (vital signs), and exposure/decontamination (removing clothing). A compromised airway is the most immediate threat.",
