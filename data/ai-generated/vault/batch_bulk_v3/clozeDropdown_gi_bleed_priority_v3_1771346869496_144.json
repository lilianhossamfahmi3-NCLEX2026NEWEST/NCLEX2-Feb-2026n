He reports two episodes of coffee-ground emesis and one large, black, tarry stool over the past 6 hours. He is pale, diaphoretic, and anxious. Initial assessment reveals: BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO2 94% on room air. The nurse is developing the initial plan of care. \n\nBased on the client's presentation, the nurse should first {{dropdown_1}}.

The most critical ongoing assessment to monitor for decompensation is the client's {{dropdown_3}}.",

First, establishing two large-bore IVs is the highest priority to enable rapid fluid and blood product resuscitation, directly addressing the patient's hypotension and tachycardia (Circulation). Second, administering an octreotide infusion is crucial because it reduces splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, which directly targets the pathophysiology of bleeding esophageal varices, a high probability in a patient with cirrhosis. Third, monitoring the level of consciousness is the most sensitive indicator of cerebral perfusion and can provide the earliest warning of worsening shock or the development of hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of GI bleeding in cirrhotic patients.",
        "incorrect": "Other sequences are incorrect because they do not follow the standard prioritization framework (e.g., Circulation, Airway, Breathing) for a hemodynamically unstable patient. Delaying IV access for history taking or non-emergent interventions is inappropriate. Choosing PRBCs before octreotide fails to address the underlying cause of the bleed, leading to a cycle of transfusion and re-bleeding. Focusing on less sensitive assessments like lab values (which have a lag time) or urine output (which changes later in shock) over neurological status can lead to a delayed recognition of critical decompensation.",
