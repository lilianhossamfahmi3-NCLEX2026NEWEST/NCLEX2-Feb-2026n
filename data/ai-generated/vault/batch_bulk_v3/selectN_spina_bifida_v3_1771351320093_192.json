    "question": "A 7-year-old client with a history of myelomeningocele repaired at birth and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is seen in the neurology clinic. The parents report the child has new-onset, progressive lower back pain, a noticeable worsening of their scoliosis over the past two months, and changes in bladder function, including more frequent urinary incontinence between clean intermittent catheterizations (CIC). The nurse suspects tethered cord syndrome. Which interventions should the nurse prioritize and anticipate for this client? Select all that apply.",

        "brief": "The nurse should anticipate diagnostic imaging (MRI), a focused neurological assessment, preparing the family for potential surgery, and collaborating with rehabilitation services. These interventions address the diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and functional impact of suspected tethered cord syndrome.",

                "id": "opt_1",
                "rationale": "Correct. An MRI of the spine is the gold standard diagnostic tool to visualize the spinal cord and confirm the presence of tethered cord syndrome, where scar tissue from the original repair site adheres to the spinal cord, causing stretching and neurological symptoms as the child grows."
            },
            {
                "id": "opt_2",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While increased incontinence is a symptom, simply increasing the frequency of catheterization addresses the symptom but not the underlying neurological cause. The priority is to diagnose and treat the cause of the bladder changes, which is the suspected tethered cord."
            },
            {
                "id": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. A head CT scan is used to evaluate the ventricles and assess for VP shunt malfunction. While shunt malfunction is a consideration in any child with a shunt, the presenting symptoms (lower back pain, worsening scoliosis, changes in bladder/lower extremity function) are classic signs of tethered cord syndrome, not increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, lethargy)."

            {
                "id": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Correct. Tethered cord syndrome causes progressive neurological deficits due to spinal cord stretching. A detailed neurological assessment of the lower extremities, including muscle strength, tone, and sensation, is critical to establish a baseline and identify the extent of the neurological impairment."

                "id": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "Correct. The definitive treatment for symptomatic tethered cord syndrome is surgical release of the adhesions. It is an essential nursing role to provide anticipatory guidance and education, preparing the family for the high likelihood of a surgical procedure to prevent further neurological damage."

                "id": "opt_6",
                "rationale": "Correct. The reported changes in scoliosis and bladder function indicate a change in the client's functional status. Collaboration with physical and occupational therapy is crucial to obtain a new baseline assessment, address functional declines, and plan for pre- and post-operative rehabilitation needs."
