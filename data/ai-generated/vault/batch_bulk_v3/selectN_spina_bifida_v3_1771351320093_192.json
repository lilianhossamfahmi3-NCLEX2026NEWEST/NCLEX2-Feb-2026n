  "question": "A 7-year-old client with a history of myelomeningocele repaired at birth and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is seen in the neurology clinic. The parents report the child has new-onset, progressive lower back pain, a noticeable worsening of their scoliosis over the past two months, and changes in bladder function, including more frequent urinary incontinence between clean intermittent catheterizations (CIC). The nurse suspects tethered cord syndrome. Which interventions should the nurse prioritize and anticipate for this client? Select all that apply.",

    "brief": "The nurse should anticipate diagnostic imaging (MRI), a focused neurological assessment, preparing the family for potential surgery, and collaborating with rehabilitation services.

        "rationale": "Correct. <SATA/Highlight: +> An MRI of the spine is the gold standard diagnostic tool to visualize the spinal cord and confirm the presence of tethered cord syndrome. <clinicalPearl: Explain the MRI procedure to the child and family, emphasizing the importance of remaining still during the scan. Consider using child-friendly language and distraction techniques.> In tethered cord syndrome, scar tissue from the original myelomeningocele repair adheres to the spinal cord. As the child grows, this adhesion restricts the spinal cord's movement within the spinal canal, causing traction and ischemia. This traction leads to neurological deficits, pain, and changes in bowel and bladder function.",

The priority is to diagnose and treat the cause of the bladder changes, which is the suspected tethered cord. <clinicalPearl: Document the frequency and amount of urinary incontinence to establish a baseline and monitor for changes.> Increasing catheterization frequency without addressing the underlying cause can lead to patient discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract infections.",

While shunt malfunction is a consideration in any child with a shunt, the presenting symptoms (lower back pain, worsening scoliosis, changes in bladder/lower extremity function) are classic signs of tethered cord syndrome, not increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, lethargy). <clinicalPearl: Assess for other signs of VP shunt malfunction, such as irritability, bulging fontanelles (in infants), and changes in level of consciousness.> A CT scan exposes the child to radiation and is not indicated based on the presenting symptoms.",

A detailed neurological assessment of the lower extremities, including muscle strength, tone, sensation (light touch, pain, temperature), and reflexes, is critical to establish a baseline and identify the extent of the neurological impairment. <clinicalPearl: Use age-appropriate assessment tools and techniques to evaluate motor and sensory function.

It is an essential nursing role to provide anticipatory guidance and education, preparing the family for the high likelihood of a surgical procedure to prevent further neurological damage. <clinicalPearl: Provide the family with information about the surgical procedure, potential risks and benefits, and the expected recovery process.

Collaboration with physical and occupational therapy is crucial to obtain a new baseline assessment, address functional declines, and plan for pre- and post-operative rehabilitation needs. <clinicalPearl: Advocate for early involvement of physical and occupational therapy to optimize the child's functional abilities and prevent complications.> Physical and occupational therapy can help improve muscle strength, coordination, and mobility, as well as provide adaptive equipment and strategies to promote independence.",
