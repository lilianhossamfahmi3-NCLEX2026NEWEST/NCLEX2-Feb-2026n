The first action is to calculate and communicate the interdialytic weight gain (72 kg - 69.5 kg = 2.5 kg), as this determines the ultrafiltration goal for the session and directly addresses the client's fluid overload (edema, crackles, SOB). The most common and immediate complication of rapid fluid removal during dialysis is hypotension, making it the priority for monitoring. The client's potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L poses a significant and immediate risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, necessitating continuous cardiac monitoring to detect any EKG changes promptly.",

For example, while withholding antihypertensives is often correct, communicating fluid status for programming the dialysis machine is more foundational to the treatment's goal. Monitoring for disequilibrium syndrome is important but less common than monitoring for hypotension. Preparing for a blood transfusion or ordering a meal are not priorities related to the immediate, life-threatening risk of hyperkalemia.",
