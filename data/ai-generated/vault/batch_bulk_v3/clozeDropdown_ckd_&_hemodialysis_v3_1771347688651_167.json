    "correct": "The nurse correctly identifies the priorities for a client preparing for hemodialysis. The first action is to calculate and communicate the interdialytic weight gain (72 kg - 69.5 kg = 2.5 kg), as this determines the ultrafiltration goal for the session and directly addresses the client's fluid overload (edema, crackles, SOB). The most common and immediate complication of rapid fluid removal during dialysis is hypotension, making it the priority for monitoring. The client's potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L poses a significant and immediate risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, necessitating continuous cardiac monitoring to detect any EKG changes promptly.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect choices reflect actions that are either not the immediate priority, are less critical than the correct option, or are inappropriate in the acute dialysis setting. For example, while withholding antihypertensives is often correct, communicating fluid status for programming the dialysis machine is more foundational to the treatment's goal. Monitoring for disequilibrium syndrome is important but less common than monitoring for hypotension. Preparing for a blood transfusion or ordering a meal are not priorities related to the immediate, life-threatening risk of hyperkalemia.",

This represents a 2.5 L fluid gain, which explains the client's shortness of breath, crackles, and edema. Communicating this 'target weight' or fluid removal goal to the dialysis technician is critical for programming the machine for appropriate ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration goal is set to remove this excess fluid during the dialysis session, alleviating the client's symptoms of fluid overload. This step directly impacts the effectiveness and safety of the dialysis treatment."

While calcium gluconate is used to treat hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity by stabilizing the cardiac membrane, it is only administered if EKG changes are present. The priority is to implement the monitoring (continuous cardiac monitoring) that would detect the need for such an emergency medication. Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels but protects the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia. Continuous monitoring is needed to determine if calcium gluconate is necessary."
