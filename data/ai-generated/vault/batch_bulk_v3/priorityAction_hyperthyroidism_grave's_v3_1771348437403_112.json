    "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is preparing a 38-year-old client for discharge. The client was diagnosed with Grave's disease and has new prescriptions for methimazole and propranolol. The client is hemodynamically stable and has a follow-up appointment with an endocrinologist in one week. Which instruction is the **priority** for the nurse to provide?",

        "correctRationale": {
            "optionId": "opt_A",
            "explanation": "This is the priority instruction. Methimazole, an antithyroid medication, can cause agranulocytosis, a rare but life-threatening side effect characterized by a severe drop in white blood cell count. This drastically increases the risk of serious infection. A sore throat and fever are early signs of infection and require immediate medical evaluation and a complete blood count (CBC) to rule out agranulocytosis. Prompt recognition is critical to prevent sepsis and death."
        },
        "distractorRationale": [
            {
                "optionId": "opt_B",
                "explanation": "This is an important and correct instruction for a client taking a beta-blocker like propranolol. However, it is not the priority over recognizing a potentially fatal medication side effect. While bradycardia can be a concern, a fulminant infection from untreated agranulocytosis presents a more immediate and severe threat to the client's life."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_C",
                "explanation": "This statement is true and helps manage the client's expectations regarding their treatment course. However, it is a therapeutic communication point, not a critical safety instruction related to an acute, life-threatening complication. Patient safety instructions always take precedence over managing therapeutic expectations."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_D",
                "explanation": "While clients with hyperthyroidism often need increased caloric intake due to their hypermetabolic state, this is a general dietary guideline for managing the condition. It does not address an immediate, life-threatening risk associated with the new medication regimen. Medication safety is a higher priority than dietary management at the point of discharge."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_E",
                "explanation": "Monitoring weight is an important way to assess the effectiveness of the treatment, as weight gain often indicates that the hyperthyroid state is being controlled. This is part of ongoing disease management but is not an urgent safety priority compared to the need to recognize and report signs of a severe adverse drug reaction."
