    "question": "A 68-year-old male with a history of osteoarthritis treated with daily naproxen is brought to the emergency department. He reports feeling dizzy and weak for 12 hours and had one episode of coffee-ground emesis this morning. His vital signs are: BP 92/58 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 22/min, SpO2 94% on room air. The client's skin is cool and pale. The nurse has just completed the primary assessment. Which actions should the nurse perform immediately? Select all that apply.",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "opt_1": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The client is hemodynamically unstable (hypotension, tachycardia) and showing signs of hypovolemic shock from a GI bleed. Establishing two large-bore (18-gauge or larger) IVs is a critical first step to allow for rapid infusion of isotonic fluids and blood products to restore circulating volume."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While an IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is indicated to decrease gastric acid production, an oral medication is inappropriate for a client with active vomiting who will need to be NPO (nothing by mouth) for a potential endoscopy. Furthermore, stabilizing hemodynamics with fluid resuscitation is a higher initial priority."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's tachycardia (118 bpm) is a compensatory response to blood loss. Hypovolemia and potential electrolyte shifts can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect any life-threatening arrhythmias promptly."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. A client with an active upper GI bleed must be kept NPO. This is to prevent further vomiting or aspiration and to prepare the client for an urgent endoscopy, which is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic procedure."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's hypotension and tachycardia are clear signs of intravascular volume depletion. Immediate administration of an isotonic crystalloid solution, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, is necessary to expand intravascular volume, increase blood pressure, and improve tissue perfusion."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "rationale": "Correct. Given the evidence of significant bleeding (coffee-ground emesis, hemodynamic instability), it is highly likely the client will require a blood transfusion. Obtaining a blood sample for a type and crossmatch is a priority action to ensure compatible packed red blood cells are available as soon as possible."
        },
        "opt_7": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is a common cause of gastritis and GI bleeding. Administering another dose would be contraindicated as it would worsen the bleeding. The underlying cause must be addressed, not exacerbated."
