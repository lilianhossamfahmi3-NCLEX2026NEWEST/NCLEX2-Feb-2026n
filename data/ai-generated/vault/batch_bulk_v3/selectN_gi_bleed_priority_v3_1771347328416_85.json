  "question": "A 68-year-old male with a history of osteoarthritis treated with daily naproxen is brought to the emergency department. He reports feeling dizzy and weak for 12 hours and had one episode of coffee-ground emesis this morning. His vital signs at 1000 are: BP 92/58 mmHg, HR 118 bpm, RR 22/min, SpO2 94% on room air. The client's skin is cool and pale. The nurse has just completed the primary assessment. Which actions should the nurse perform immediately? Select all that apply.",

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "opt_1": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The client presents with hypotension (92/58 mmHg), tachycardia (118 bpm), and coffee-ground emesis, indicative of hypovolemic shock secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed. Establishing two large-bore (18-gauge or larger) IV catheters is crucial for rapid fluid resuscitation and potential blood product administration. This facilitates the immediate restoration of circulating volume and improves tissue perfusion. The rapid infusion of fluids is essential to stabilize the client's hemodynamic status.",
      "correctFeedback": "Establishing large-bore IVs allows for rapid fluid and blood product administration to address hypovolemic shock.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "The client's hemodynamic instability requires immediate venous access for fluid resuscitation.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In hypovolemic shock, large-bore IVs are essential for rapid fluid resuscitation. Prioritize establishing access before other interventions."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is often indicated in upper GI bleeds to reduce gastric acid secretion and promote clot stability, the oral route is contraindicated in a client with active vomiting and potential for endoscopy. Furthermore, addressing the hypovolemia with fluid resuscitation takes priority. An IV PPI may be considered later, but not as an immediate action.",
      "correctFeedback": "Oral medications are contraindicated due to active vomiting and the need for potential endoscopy.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "Fluid resuscitation is the priority in this unstable client.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In acute GI bleeds with vomiting, avoid oral medications and prioritize IV access and fluid resuscitation."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's tachycardia (118 bpm) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output in the setting of hypovolemia. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect potential arrhythmias resulting from electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia) or myocardial ischemia due to decreased oxygen delivery. Early detection of arrhythmias allows for prompt intervention and prevention of further complications.",
      "correctFeedback": "Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect arrhythmias related to hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "Cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage potential arrhythmias.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Tachycardia in the setting of hypovolemia can lead to arrhythmias; continuous cardiac monitoring is vital."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. A client with an active upper GI bleed and coffee-ground emesis is at high risk for further bleeding and aspiration. Therefore, the client should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) until the bleeding is controlled and the cause is identified. Providing a clear liquid diet would increase the risk of vomiting and aspiration.",
      "correctFeedback": "The client should be NPO to prevent further bleeding and aspiration.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "An NPO status is required to prevent further complications.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In active GI bleeds, NPO status is crucial to prevent aspiration and prepare for potential endoscopy."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's hypotension (92/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (118 bpm) indicate significant intravascular volume depletion. Administering a bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) is the initial treatment to expand intravascular volume, increase blood pressure, and improve tissue perfusion. This helps to stabilize the client's hemodynamic status and prevent further complications such as organ damage.",
      "correctFeedback": "A normal saline bolus will expand intravascular volume and improve blood pressure.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "Fluid resuscitation is essential to address the client's hypovolemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Normal saline is the initial fluid of choice for volume resuscitation in hypovolemic shock."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "rationale": "Correct. The presence of coffee-ground emesis and hemodynamic instability strongly suggests significant blood loss. Obtaining blood for type and crossmatch is a priority to prepare for a potential blood transfusion. This ensures that compatible packed red blood cells are available to replace lost blood volume and improve oxygen-carrying capacity.",
      "correctFeedback": "Type and crossmatch are essential to prepare for a potential blood transfusion.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "Blood transfusion may be necessary to address significant blood loss.",
      "clinicalPearl": "In suspected significant blood loss, early type and crossmatch are crucial for timely blood transfusion."
    },
    "opt_7": {
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain. However, NSAIDs are known to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by inhibiting platelet aggregation and damaging the gastric mucosa. Administering more naproxen would exacerbate the existing bleeding and is contraindicated.",
      "correctFeedback": "Naproxen is contraindicated as it can worsen GI bleeding.",
      "incorrectFeedback": "NSAIDs increase the risk of GI bleeding and should be avoided.",
      "clinicalPearl": "NSAIDs are a common cause of GI bleeding and should be avoided in clients with active bleeding."
