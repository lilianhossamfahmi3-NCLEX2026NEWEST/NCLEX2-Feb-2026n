    "correct": "Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. Each clinical manifestation can be traced back to one of cortisol's primary physiological actions. Cortisol suppresses the immune system by inhibiting inflammatory mediators and immune cell function, leading to increased infection risk. It stimulates gluconeogenesis (glucose production in the liver) and causes insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, resulting in hyperglycemia. Cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects cause sodium and water retention, leading to hypertension and potentially hypokalemia. Finally, its catabolic effects break down protein and fat in the periphery (limbs) and redistribute fat centrally (trunk, face, back), causing truncal obesity, thin extremities, and fragile skin with striae.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrectly matching the manifestations to the pathophysiology demonstrates a misunderstanding of the specific endocrine functions of cortisol. For example, attributing hypertension to immunosuppression or hyperglycemia to catabolism confuses the distinct metabolic, immune, and electrolyte-regulating roles of the hormone.",
