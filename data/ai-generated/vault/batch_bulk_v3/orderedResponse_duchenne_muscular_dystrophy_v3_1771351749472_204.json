    "question": "The school nurse is called to the playground for a 9-year-old child with a known diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) who has fallen. The child is sitting on the ground, alert, and crying. He has a small abrasion on his right knee and states, \"It feels a little hard to catch my breath.\" The nurse assists the child to the health office. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag the actions from the left to the correct sequence on the right.",

        "prompt": "The question requires the nurse to prioritize actions for a child with DMD who has fallen and is reporting dyspnea. The correct sequence follows the nursing process and principles of airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs), addressing the most life-threatening concern first.",
        "options": [
            {
                "id": "opt_4",
                "order": 1,
                "explanation": "Correct First Action. According to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), the highest priority is addressing the child's report of difficulty breathing. Children with DMD have progressive weakness of respiratory muscles, making them vulnerable to respiratory compromise from minor trauma, fatigue, or stress. A focused respiratory assessment is the essential first step to determine the severity of the issue."
            },
            {
                "id": "opt_5",
                "order": 2,
                "explanation": "Correct Second Action. After the initial assessment confirms a potential breathing issue, the immediate intervention is to position the child to maximize lung expansion and ease the work of breathing. A high-Fowler's or tripod position uses gravity to move the abdominal organs down, allowing for greater diaphragmatic excursion. This is a rapid, non-invasive intervention to provide immediate relief."

            {
                "id": "opt_2",
                "order": 3,
                "explanation": "Correct Third Action. After the initial assessment and positioning, the next step is to gather objective data to quantify the child's status. Oxygen saturation is a critical indicator of gas exchange, while respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure provide a baseline and can indicate the degree of distress. This information is vital for clinical decision-making and for communicating with healthcare providers or emergency services."

            {
                "id": "opt_1",
                "order": 4,
                "explanation": "Correct Fourth Action. Once the life-threatening respiratory concern has been assessed and managed, the nurse can attend to the less urgent physical injury. The knee abrasion is a superficial wound that poses a low risk of immediate harm. Providing basic first aid is appropriate but is a lower priority than ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation."
            },
            {
                "id": "opt_3",
                "order": 5,
                "explanation": "Correct Fifth Action. Communication with the legal guardian is a crucial part of the nurse's role. However, it should only occur after the child has been assessed and stabilized. The nurse's primary responsibility is the immediate safety and well-being of the child. Contacting the guardian is most effective when the nurse can provide a clear report of the situation, the actions taken, and the child's current status."
