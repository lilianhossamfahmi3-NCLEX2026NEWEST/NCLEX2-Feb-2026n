  "question": "The school nurse is called to the playground at 1400 for a 9-year-old child with a known diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) who has fallen. The child is sitting on the ground, alert, and crying. He has a small abrasion on his right knee and states, \"It feels a little hard to catch my breath.\" The nurse assists the child to the health office. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag the actions from the left to the correct sequence on the right.",

    "prompt": "Prioritize nursing actions for a child with DMD experiencing dyspnea after a fall. Follow ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) to address the most life-threatening concern first.",
    "options": [
      {
        "id": "opt_4",
        "order": 1,
        "explanation": "**Correct First Action.** Assessing respiratory status is the priority. DMD causes progressive muscle weakness, including respiratory muscles, increasing vulnerability to respiratory compromise. Dyspnea indicates potential respiratory distress. Assess respiratory rate, effort (e.g., retractions, nasal flaring), and auscultate lung sounds for adventitious sounds (wheezing, crackles) or diminished breath sounds. This assessment determines the severity of respiratory compromise and guides further interventions. Rapid identification of respiratory distress is crucial in DMD due to the potential for rapid deterioration.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In DMD, even minor events can trigger respiratory distress. Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing respiratory failure."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_5",
        "order": 2,
        "explanation": "**Correct Second Action.** After initial respiratory assessment, immediately assist the child into a high-Fowler's or tripod position. This position maximizes lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm from abdominal contents. Increased lung expansion improves ventilation and oxygenation, easing the work of breathing. This is a non-invasive intervention providing immediate relief.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Positioning is a simple yet effective intervention to improve respiratory function. Ensure the child is comfortable and supported in the chosen position."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_2",
        "order": 3,
        "explanation": "**Correct Third Action.** Obtain a full set of vital signs, including oxygen saturation (SpO2). SpO2 provides objective data on oxygenation. Respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure provide baseline data and indicate the degree of distress. Tachycardia and hypertension may indicate compensation for hypoxia, while bradycardia and hypotension may indicate decompensation. This data informs clinical decision-making and communication with healthcare providers.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Pulse oximetry is essential for monitoring oxygenation. Be aware that SpO2 readings can be affected by factors such as poor perfusion or nail polish."

      {
        "id": "opt_1",
        "order": 4,
        "explanation": "**Correct Fourth Action.** After addressing respiratory concerns, attend to the knee abrasion. Cleanse the abrasion with mild soap and water or saline solution to prevent infection. Apply an adhesive bandage to protect the wound and prevent further injury. While important, this is a lower priority than ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Even minor wounds should be properly cleaned and protected to prevent infection, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems or chronic conditions."
      },
      {
        "id": "opt_3",
        "order": 5,
        "explanation": "**Correct Fifth Action.** Contact the child's legal guardian to report the incident and findings. Provide a clear and concise report of the situation, actions taken, and the child's current status. The guardian needs to be informed of the fall, the child's respiratory distress, and any interventions performed. This allows the guardian to make informed decisions about further medical care.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Effective communication with parents/guardians is crucial. Provide updates and involve them in the care plan."
