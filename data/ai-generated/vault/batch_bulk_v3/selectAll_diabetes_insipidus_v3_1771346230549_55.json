    "scenario": "A 58-year-old client is in the intensive care unit on postoperative day 2 following a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record and notes the following findings: 24-hour urine output of 8.2 liters, urine specific gravity of 1.002, serum sodium of 152 mEq/L (11.9 mmol/L), and serum osmolality of 315 mOsm/kg (315 mmol/kg). The client reports intense thirst and appears fatigued. The provider has diagnosed the client with central diabetes insipidus (DI).",

        "explanation": "This client is exhibiting classic signs of central diabetes insipidus (DI), a condition caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) leading to the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine and subsequent dehydration and hypernatremia. The plan of care must focus on replacing the missing hormone, rehydrating the client, monitoring their response, and ensuring safety.",

            {
                "optionId": "opt_01",
                "rationale": "Correct. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analog of ADH and is the primary treatment for central DI. It works by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby concentrating the urine, decreasing urine output, and lowering serum sodium levels."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_02",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Fluid restriction is the primary intervention for the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), which is the opposite of DI. Implementing a fluid restriction for a client with DI would be dangerous, leading to severe dehydration, worsening hypernatremia, and potential hypovolemic shock."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_03",
                "rationale": "Correct. Frequent monitoring of urine specific gravity is essential to evaluate the client's response to treatment. In DI, the urine is very dilute, with a specific gravity typically below 1.005. An increase in the specific gravity indicates that the desmopressin is effective and the kidneys are beginning to conserve water."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing intense polydipsia (thirst) as a compensatory mechanism for massive fluid loss and hyperosmolality. Providing free access to water helps replace lost fluids and prevents severe dehydration, as long as the client is conscious and able to drink."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_05",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's serum sodium is already elevated (hypernatremia). Administering a hypertonic solution like 3% sodium chloride would dangerously increase the serum sodium and osmolality, leading to severe cellular dehydration, especially in brain cells, and potentially causing seizures, coma, or death. The client requires hypotonic fluids (e.g., D5W, 0.45% NaCl) to correct the free water deficit."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_06",
                "rationale": "Correct. Significant fluid volume loss can lead to postural hypotension, weakness, and dizziness. Additionally, the need for frequent urination (nocturia) increases the risk of the client getting out of bed, particularly at night. Therefore, implementing fall precautions is a critical safety intervention."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_07",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, which would increase urine output and exacerbate the polyuria caused by DI. This would counteract the goals of treatment and worsen the client's fluid and electrolyte imbalance."
