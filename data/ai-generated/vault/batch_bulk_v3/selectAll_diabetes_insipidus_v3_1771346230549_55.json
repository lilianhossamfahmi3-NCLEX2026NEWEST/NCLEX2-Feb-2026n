The nurse reviews the client's electronic health record and notes the following findings: 24-hour urine output of 8.2 liters, urine specific gravity of 1.002, serum sodium of 152 mEq/L (11.9 mmol/L), and serum osmolality of 315 mOsm/kg (315 mmol/kg). The client reports intense thirst and appears fatigued. The provider has diagnosed the client with central diabetes insipidus (DI).",

    "explanation": "This client presents with central diabetes insipidus (DI) following a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, indicated by high urine output, low urine specific gravity, hypernatremia, and elevated serum osmolality. Central DI results from insufficient antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production or release from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH normally promotes water reabsorption in the kidneys' collecting ducts. Its deficiency leads to excessive water excretion, causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Post-operative pituitary damage can disrupt ADH secretion. The plan of care aims to replace ADH, correct dehydration, and prevent complications.",
    "optionBreakdown": [
      {
        "optionId": "opt_01",
        "rationale": "Correct. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic vasopressin analog that acts as an antidiuretic. It binds to V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, increasing water reabsorption, decreasing urine output, and concentrating urine. This helps correct the fluid deficit and hypernatremia associated with DI. Monitor for hyponatremia as a potential complication of DDAVP. Clinical Pearl: DDAVP can be administered intranasally, orally, or intravenously. The dosage is adjusted based on the client's response, including urine output and serum sodium levels."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_02",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Fluid restriction is contraindicated in DI. The client is already severely dehydrated due to excessive water loss. Restricting fluids would exacerbate dehydration, worsen hypernatremia, and potentially lead to hypovolemic shock. The priority is to provide adequate fluid replacement to compensate for the ongoing losses. Clinical Pearl: Fluid restriction is appropriate for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), the opposite of DI, where there is excessive ADH leading to fluid retention and hyponatremia."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_03",
        "rationale": "Correct. Monitoring urine specific gravity is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment. In DI, urine specific gravity is typically very low (less than 1.005) due to the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. An increasing specific gravity indicates that desmopressin is working and the kidneys are reabsorbing more water. Clinical Pearl: Monitor urine specific gravity with each void initially, then less frequently as the client stabilizes. Report any significant changes to the provider. Target range is 1.010-1.025."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_04",
        "rationale": "Correct. The client is experiencing intense thirst (polydipsia) as a compensatory mechanism to maintain fluid balance. Providing free access to fresh water allows the client to replace lost fluids and prevent severe dehydration. Ensure the client can safely access and drink water. Clinical Pearl: Monitor the client's intake and output closely. If the client is unable to drink enough to keep up with losses, intravenous fluids may be necessary."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_05",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering 3% sodium chloride is dangerous in this situation. The client already has hypernatremia (elevated serum sodium). A hypertonic solution like 3% NaCl would further increase serum sodium levels, leading to severe cellular dehydration, especially in the brain, potentially causing seizures, coma, or death. Clinical Pearl: The client requires hypotonic fluids (e.g., 0.45% NaCl) or isotonic fluids (0.9% NaCl) to gradually correct the free water deficit and hypernatremia. Avoid rapid correction of hypernatremia to prevent cerebral edema."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_06",
        "rationale": "Correct. The client is at increased risk for falls due to several factors: weakness and dizziness from dehydration, postural hypotension, and frequent nocturia (the need to get up to urinate at night). Implementing strict fall precautions, such as keeping the bed in a low position, ensuring adequate lighting, and assisting with ambulation, is essential to prevent injury. Clinical Pearl: Assess the client's gait and balance regularly. Encourage the use of assistive devices, such as a walker or cane, if needed. Ensure the client knows to call for assistance before getting out of bed."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_07",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Caffeinated beverages have a diuretic effect, increasing urine output and exacerbating the polyuria caused by DI. This would counteract the goals of treatment and worsen the client's fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Clinical Pearl: Educate the client to avoid caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, while being treated for DI."
