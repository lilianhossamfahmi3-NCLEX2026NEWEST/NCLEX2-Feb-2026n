The client's hyperthermia (38.9° C / 102.0° F) significantly increases metabolic demand and oxygen consumption, contributing to cardiopulmonary and neurological compromise. Aggressive cooling measures and antipyretics are essential to reduce body temperature and prevent further complications."

The client is exhibiting the classic triad of thyroid storm: hyperthermia, extreme tachycardia, and significant central nervous system dysfunction (agitation, confusion).

The profound effect of excess thyroid hormone on the heart places the client at high risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, ventricular tachycardia) and heart failure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for early detection and intervention."
