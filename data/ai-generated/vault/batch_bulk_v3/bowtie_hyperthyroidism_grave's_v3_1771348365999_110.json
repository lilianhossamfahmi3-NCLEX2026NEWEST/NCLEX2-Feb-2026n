The client's severe tachycardia (148/min) and hypertension (168/94 mmHg) are life-threatening manifestations of the hyperadrenergic state in thyroid storm. Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) rapidly control heart rate, blood pressure, and anxiety, reducing cardiac workload and the risk of decompensation. Beta-blockers inhibit the conversion of T4 to T3, further reducing thyroid hormone effects.",

Administering it to a client in a thyrotoxic state would be lethal, as it would worsen the already critically high levels of circulating thyroid hormone. This would exacerbate the hypermetabolic state, leading to increased oxygen demand and potential cardiac arrest.",

The client's hyperthermia (38.9° C / 102.0° F) significantly increases metabolic demand and oxygen consumption, contributing to cardiopulmonary and neurological compromise. Aggressive cooling measures and antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) are essential to reduce body temperature and prevent further complications such as seizures and brain damage. Hyperthermia increases thyroid hormone release, creating a positive feedback loop.",
