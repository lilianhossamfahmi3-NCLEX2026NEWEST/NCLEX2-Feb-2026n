The client reports severe, sharp epigastric pain rated 9/10 that radiates to the back. The nurse reviews the initial laboratory results.

In acute pancreatitis, inflammation triggers the release of cytokines, stimulating the bone marrow to produce more WBCs. This is a common finding due to the systemic inflammatory response.

In severe acute pancreatitis, the release of pancreatic enzymes leads to fat necrosis. Free fatty acids are released, which then bind to calcium in a process called saponification, effectively removing calcium from the circulation. Severe hypocalcemia is a life-threatening emergency that can lead to neuromuscular excitability (tetany, positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs), seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias (prolonged QT interval) due to altered membrane potentials and impaired cellular function.
