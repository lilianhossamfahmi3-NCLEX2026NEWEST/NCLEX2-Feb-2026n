The daughter reports, 'Mom hasn't been taking her thyroid medicine for a few months, and she seems so much slower and is always cold.' The nurse is performing an assessment. Which of the following findings would the nurse expect, consistent with severe hypothyroidism? Select all that apply.",

        "opt_1": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. In severe hypothyroidism (myxedema), there is an accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the dermis and other tissues. This leads to non-pitting edema, which is often most noticeable around the eyes (periorbital edema), giving the face a puffy appearance."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormones have a direct effect on heart rate and contractility. A deficiency of these hormones decreases the metabolic rate and sympathetic nervous system activity, resulting in bradycardia (a heart rate less than 60 beats/min)."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) is a symptom of a hypermetabolic state, which is characteristic of hyperthyroidism due to heat intolerance. Clients with hypothyroidism have a low metabolic rate, leading to cold intolerance and dry, cool skin."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs) is a hallmark sign of Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition that causes hyperthyroidism. It is not associated with hypothyroidism."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the proper growth and maintenance of hair follicles. In hypothyroidism, hair becomes dry, brittle, coarse, and may thin significantly. Loss of the outer third of the eyebrows (madarosis) is also a classic sign."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Increased appetite with unintentional weight loss is a classic presentation of hyperthyroidism, where the basal metabolic rate is significantly elevated. In hypothyroidism, clients typically experience a decreased appetite, but may still gain weight due to a slowed metabolism and fluid retention."
        },
        "opt_7": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Hypothyroidism slows down metabolic processes throughout the body, including gastrointestinal motility. This decreased peristalsis commonly leads to constipation, which can be severe and chronic."
