    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms indicative of dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS). DASS occurs when the AV fistula diverts excessive arterial blood flow from the distal extremity, leading to ischemia. The 'pins and needles' sensation (paresthesia), aching pain, pallor, coolness, and prolonged capillary refill (4 seconds) in the left hand strongly suggest compromised blood supply. The priority is to immediately notify the PHP (Primary Healthcare Provider) at [current time + 5 minutes] to facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention. Potential interventions include fistula banding or ligation to restore adequate distal perfusion and prevent irreversible tissue damage, nerve damage, or limb loss. This is a time-sensitive vascular emergency.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   **Option A:** Elevating the arm is contraindicated. Elevation reduces arterial blood flow due to gravity, exacerbating the existing ischemia and potentially worsening the client's condition.\n*   **Option B:** Administering morphine addresses the symptom (pain) but does not treat the underlying cause (ischemia). Delaying definitive treatment to address the ischemia can lead to irreversible tissue damage. Pain management is secondary to restoring adequate blood flow.\n*   **Option D:** Documenting and reassessing in 30 minutes is unacceptable. The client's symptoms suggest a critical vascular compromise. Delaying intervention for 30 minutes could result in irreversible tissue damage, nerve damage, or limb loss. Immediate action is required.",

Always assess the fistula site for thrill and bruit, and compare the affected extremity to the unaffected extremity.",
