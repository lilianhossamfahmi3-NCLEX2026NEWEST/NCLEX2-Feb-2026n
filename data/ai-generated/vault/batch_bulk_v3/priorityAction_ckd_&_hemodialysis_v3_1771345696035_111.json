This is a serious complication where the fistula diverts an excessive amount of arterial blood, causing ischemia to the distal extremity. This condition is a potential limb-threatening emergency. The priority action is to immediately notify the primary healthcare provider for urgent evaluation and potential intervention, which may include fistula banding or ligation to preserve limb function.",
