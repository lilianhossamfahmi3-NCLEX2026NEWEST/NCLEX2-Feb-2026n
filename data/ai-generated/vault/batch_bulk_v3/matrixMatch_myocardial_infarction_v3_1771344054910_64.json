        "correct": "The nurse must correctly evaluate assessment data following a PCI to determine if the client is improving, exhibiting expected (often benign) findings, or deteriorating. Successful reperfusion is indicated by the resolution of ST-segment elevation on the ECG, cessation of chest pain, and hemodynamic stability (e.g., normal BP). Certain findings, like occasional PVCs, are common reperfusion arrhythmias and are considered expected if infrequent. However, new-onset crackles suggest developing heart failure (a major complication), and oliguria (urine output <30 mL/hr) indicates poor renal perfusion, which may be due to cardiogenic shock or contrast-induced nephropathy. Prompt identification of worsening signs is critical for early intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Misinterpreting these findings can lead to significant adverse outcomes. Classifying crackles or oliguria as 'expected' or 'improvement' would delay critical interventions like diuretic administration or fluid challenges, potentially leading to overt pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, or cardiogenic shock. Mistaking ST-segment resolution or pain relief as 'worsening' would lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. Confusing a benign, expected finding like occasional PVCs with a worsening condition could result in the unnecessary administration of antiarrhythmic drugs with significant side effects.",
