        "itemRationale": "The client's presentation of headache, nausea, and restlessness following hemodialysis is highly suggestive of Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS). This is a neurological emergency caused by the rapid removal of urea and other solutes from the blood, leading to a temporary osmotic gradient that causes fluid to shift into the brain, resulting in cerebral edema. This condition can progress to seizures, coma, and death. The priority action is to recognize these signs as a significant change in neurological status and immediately notify the provider for further orders, which may include administering hypertonic saline or mannitol to reduce cerebral edema.",

                "text": "Administer a PRN dose of acetaminophen for the headache.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. This action treats a symptom (headache) but fails to address the underlying, potentially life-threatening cause, which is cerebral edema from DDS. Delaying communication with the provider to administer an analgesic could result in a significant decline in the client's condition."

                "text": "Notify the primary healthcare provider of the client's change in neurological status.",
                "rationale": "Correct. The constellation of neurological symptoms (headache, restlessness) and nausea post-dialysis strongly indicates DDS. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention to manage cerebral edema. The nurse's priority is to communicate these critical findings to the provider to facilitate immediate diagnosis and treatment."

                "id": "opt_3",
                "text": "Check the client's arteriovenous (AV) fistula for a bruit and thrill.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. While assessing the patency of the AV fistula is a standard and important part of post-dialysis care, it is not the priority in the presence of an acute neurological change. The principle of 'life over limb' applies; a potential neurological emergency takes precedence over routine access site assessment."

                "text": "Obtain a post-dialysis weight to assess fluid removal.",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Comparing pre- and post-dialysis weights is a key intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and manage fluid balance. However, this is a routine assessment that is a lower priority than addressing an acute, life-threatening complication like DDS. The client's immediate safety related to their neurological status is the primary concern."
