        "correct": "The correct order of interventions prioritizes airway clearance and timely diagnostics before initiating other treatments. First, administering the albuterol nebulizer (a bronchodilator) opens the airways. This makes the subsequent chest physiotherapy (CPT) more effective at mobilizing the thick mucus from the smaller airways. After CPT, a sputum sample is obtained, as the mobilized secretions provide a more accurate sample from the lower respiratory tract for culture. The IV antibiotic (tobramycin) is then administered after the culture is obtained to ensure accurate sensitivity results. Finally, administering pancrelipase with food is addressed, which is important for nutrition but is the lowest priority compared to the immediate respiratory needs of an acute exacerbation.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order fails to follow the principles of airway management and diagnostic integrity for a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. For example, performing CPT before the bronchodilator is less effective because the airways are constricted. Administering antibiotics before obtaining a sputum culture can skew the results, potentially leading to ineffective long-term treatment. Delaying airway clearance interventions to administer nutritional enzymes or antibiotics does not address the most life-threatening problem of impaired gas exchange.",
