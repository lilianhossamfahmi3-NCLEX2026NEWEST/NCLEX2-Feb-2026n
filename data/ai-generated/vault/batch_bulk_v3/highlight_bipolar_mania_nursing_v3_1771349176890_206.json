        "correct": "The nurse must prioritize interventions based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, focusing first on physiological integrity and safety. The client's lack of food, fluid, and sleep for 48 hours poses a significant risk for dehydration, malnutrition, and physical exhaustion, which can lead to cardiac collapse. Pacing and shouting indicate severe psychomotor agitation that can escalate to aggression or self-harm from exhaustion. Making threats to others is a direct safety risk that requires immediate intervention to protect potential victims. Giving away valuable possessions demonstrates poor judgment and impulsivity, necessitating intervention to protect the client from exploitation and financial harm.",
        "incorrect": "While rapid speech, flamboyant dress, and grandiose delusions are classic symptoms of a manic episode, they do not represent an immediate threat to the client's or others' physical safety or physiological stability. These are important assessment findings that will be addressed in the overall plan of care (e.g., through medication management and therapeutic communication), but they are not as urgent as physiological deprivation, psychomotor agitation, and direct threats of harm.",
