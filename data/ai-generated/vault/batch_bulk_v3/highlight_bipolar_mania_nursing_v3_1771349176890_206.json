    "correct": "Prioritizing client safety and physiological stability is paramount. The client's refusal to eat or sleep for 48 hours places them at high risk for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, and exhaustion, potentially leading to cardiac dysrhythmias or collapse. Pacing and shouting indicate severe psychomotor agitation, increasing the risk of escalation to violence or self-harm due to exhaustion. Threats towards the roommate constitute an immediate safety risk requiring intervention to protect others. Giving away possessions reflects impaired judgment and impulsivity, necessitating intervention to prevent exploitation.",
    "incorrect": "While rapid speech, flamboyant dress, and grandiose delusions are characteristic of mania, they do not pose an immediate threat to the client's or others' physical safety or physiological well-being. These symptoms require management but are less urgent than addressing physiological needs, agitation, and safety risks.",

        "content": "Correct. This indicates a critical physiological need. Prolonged sleep and nutritional deprivation can lead to severe physical complications. Pathophysiologically, the body enters a catabolic state, depleting essential nutrients and electrolytes. Lack of sleep disrupts hormonal regulation, increasing cortisol levels and further exacerbating metabolic stress. Clinical Pearl: Monitor vital signs closely, assess for signs of dehydration (e.g., poor skin turgor, concentrated urine), and implement interventions to promote rest and nutrition.",

        "content": "Incorrect. While pressured speech is a symptom of mania, it doesn't represent an immediate threat.
