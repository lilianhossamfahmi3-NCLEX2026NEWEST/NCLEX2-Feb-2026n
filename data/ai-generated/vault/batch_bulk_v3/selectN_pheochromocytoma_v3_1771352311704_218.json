    "prompt": "The nurse is developing a plan of care for a 48-year-old client admitted for an adrenalectomy in two days to remove a diagnosed pheochromocytoma. The client was started on phenoxybenzamine 10 days ago and metoprolol 3 days ago. The client's blood pressure is 158/96 mmHg and heart rate is 102/min. The client reports a 'pounding headache'. Which nursing interventions are essential to include in the pre-operative plan of care? Select all that apply.",

      "background": "Client started on phenoxybenzamine 10 days ago and metoprolol 3 days ago. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that causes the release of excessive catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine).",

      "recommendation": "Implement pre-operative plan of care focusing on hemodynamic stability, preventing hypertensive crisis, and managing potential complications related to catecholamine surges. Continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status closely."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct (+). A pheochromocytoma secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. Stress, anxiety, and external stimuli exacerbate catecholamine release, potentially triggering a hypertensive crisis. A calm, low-stimulus environment minimizes these triggers, promoting hemodynamic stability. Pathophysiology: Catecholamines bind to alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction (alpha-1), increased heart rate and contractility (beta-1), and bronchodilation (beta-2). ClinicalPearl: Dimming lights, reducing noise, and providing emotional support are crucial to prevent catecholamine surges.",
        "clinicalPearl": "A quiet environment reduces sympathetic nervous system activation, preventing catecholamine release and subsequent hypertensive episodes. This is a cornerstone of pre-operative management."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect (-). Abdominal palpation is strictly contraindicated in clients with suspected or confirmed pheochromocytoma. Palpation can manipulate the tumor, causing a massive release of catecholamines into the circulation, resulting in a severe, potentially lethal hypertensive crisis. Pathophysiology: Direct manipulation of the tumor mechanically stimulates catecholamine release from the chromaffin cells. ClinicalPearl: Document the contraindication to abdominal palpation clearly in the patient's chart.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Avoid any direct pressure or manipulation of the abdomen in patients with pheochromocytoma to prevent a dangerous surge in catecholamines and a hypertensive crisis."

      {
        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct (+). Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, causes vasodilation to control blood pressure. A significant side effect is orthostatic hypotension due to decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Monitoring blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions is essential to assess for this effect and implement fall precautions. Pathophysiology: Alpha-blockers prevent catecholamines from binding to alpha-1 receptors on blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. ClinicalPearl: Educate the client to change positions slowly and monitor blood pressure regularly, especially after starting or adjusting the alpha-blocker dosage.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Orthostatic hypotension is a common and expected side effect of alpha-blockade. Proactive monitoring and patient education are key to preventing falls."

      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect (-). Beta-blockers (like metoprolol) should *never* be initiated before adequate alpha-blockade has been established (typically 7-14 days). Administering a beta-blocker first blocks beta-2 mediated vasodilation, leaving alpha-1 mediated vasoconstriction unopposed by circulating catecholamines. This can lead to a paradoxical and severe hypertensive crisis. Pathophysiology: Beta-blockers without alpha-blockade cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, resulting in intense vasoconstriction and dangerously elevated blood pressure. ClinicalPearl: Always confirm that alpha-blockade is adequate before initiating beta-blockade in patients with pheochromocytoma.",

        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct (+). Chronic catecholamine excess causes vasoconstriction and decreased intravascular volume. After alpha-blockade is initiated, vasodilation occurs, unmasking this volume deficit. A high-sodium diet and liberal fluid intake are prescribed pre-operatively to expand blood volume, preventing severe hypotension, especially after tumor removal. Pathophysiology: Catecholamines cause sodium and water retention, which is masked by vasoconstriction. Alpha-blockade reverses the vasoconstriction, revealing the underlying hypovolemia. ClinicalPearl: Monitor fluid balance closely and assess for signs of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia and decreased urine output.",

Liberal fluid intake, along with a high-sodium diet, is a priority pre-operative intervention. Fluid restriction exacerbates the client's relative hypovolemia. Pathophysiology: Alpha-blockade causes vasodilation, leading to a relative decrease in intravascular volume. Fluid restriction worsens this hypovolemia, increasing the risk of hypotension. ClinicalPearl: Monitor the client for signs of dehydration and encourage oral fluid intake.",
