The client was started on phenoxybenzamine 10 days ago and metoprolol 3 days ago. The client's blood pressure is 158/96 mmHg and heart rate is 102/min. The client reports a 'pounding headache'. Which nursing interventions are essential to include in the pre-operative plan of care? Select all that apply.",

Stress, anxiety, and external stimuli can trigger the release of these catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to a hypertensive crisis. A quiet, calm, low-stimulus environment is a key nursing intervention to promote hemodynamic stability and prevent life-threatening blood pressure fluctuations."

                "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Incorrect. Palpation of the abdomen over the area of the adrenal gland is strictly contraindicated in clients with a suspected or confirmed pheochromocytoma. This action can manipulate the tumor, causing a massive and potentially lethal release of catecholamines, resulting in a severe hypertensive crisis."

                "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Correct. The client is receiving an alpha-adrenergic blocker (phenoxybenzamine) to control blood pressure and prepare for surgery. A major side effect of this medication is vasodilation, which can lead to significant orthostatic hypotension. The nurse must monitor blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions to assess for this effect and implement fall precautions."

                "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Incorrect. This medication sequence is dangerous. Beta-blockers (like metoprolol) should only be initiated *after* adequate alpha-blockade has been established (typically 7-14 days). Administering a beta-blocker first would block beta-2 mediated vasodilation, leaving alpha-1 mediated vasoconstriction unopposed by the circulating catecholamines, which can lead to a paradoxical and severe hypertensive crisis. The scenario correctly states alpha-blockade was initiated first."

                "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: Correct. Chronic catecholamine excess causes vasoconstriction and a decrease in intravascular volume. After alpha-blockade is initiated, vasodilation occurs, which can unmask this volume deficit. A high-sodium diet and liberal fluid intake are prescribed pre-operatively to help expand the blood volume, which prevents severe hypotension, especially after the tumor is surgically removed."

The client needs volume expansion to counteract the effects of alpha-blockade and prevent severe post-operative hypotension. Liberal fluid intake, along with a high-sodium diet, is a priority pre-operative intervention. Fluid restriction would exacerbate the client's relative hypovolemia."
