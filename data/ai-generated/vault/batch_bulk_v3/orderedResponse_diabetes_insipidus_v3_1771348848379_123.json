This is the most critical action to stop the pathological process."

It is performed immediately after or concurrently with administering the medication that stops the fluid loss."

Clients with DI should be encouraged to drink fluid freely to match their high urine output. Therefore, this action is not only the lowest priority but is also an incorrect intervention. In a real-world scenario, the nurse would educate the client on the importance of reporting thirst and drinking to thirst, but would never advise fluid restriction."
