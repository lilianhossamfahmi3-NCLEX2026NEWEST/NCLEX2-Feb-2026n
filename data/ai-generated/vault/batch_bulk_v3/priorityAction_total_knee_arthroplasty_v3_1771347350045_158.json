According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework of prioritization, the most immediate threat to life is the severe hypoxemia. Therefore, the first and most critical action is to apply high-flow oxygen to improve arterial oxygen saturation, prevent further clinical deterioration, and support vital organ function.",
        "incorrect": "While other actions are important and should be performed quickly, they are not the first priority. Notifying the RRT is essential but should occur concurrently with or immediately after initiating life-saving interventions. Positioning helps with breathing mechanics but does not correct the underlying oxygen deficit as directly as supplemental oxygen. Administering morphine is contraindicated as it can cause respiratory depression and worsen the client's hypoxemia.",
