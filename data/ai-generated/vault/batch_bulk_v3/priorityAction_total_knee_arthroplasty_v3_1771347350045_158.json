    "correct": "The client's clinical presentation (sudden dyspnea, sharp chest pain, anxiety, HR 128/min, RR 32/min, SpO2 88%) strongly suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE), a life-threatening post-TKA complication. The priority is addressing the severe hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) to prevent organ damage. Applying high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask increases the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), improving oxygen saturation and tissue oxygenation. This supports vital organ function while awaiting further interventions. PE pathophysiology involves a blood clot obstructing pulmonary arteries, impairing gas exchange. The resulting ventilation-perfusion mismatch leads to hypoxemia and respiratory distress.",
    "incorrect": "\n*   **A:** While notifying the RRT is crucial, it's secondary to immediate oxygenation. Oxygen administration directly addresses the life-threatening hypoxemia. The RRT notification should occur concurrently or immediately after oxygen application.\n*   **B:** High-Fowler's position can aid breathing mechanics but doesn't resolve the underlying hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen is the priority to increase oxygen availability to the tissues.\n*   **D:** Morphine is contraindicated due to the risk of respiratory depression, which would worsen the client's hypoxemia and potentially lead to respiratory arrest. The priority is to improve oxygenation, not manage pain at the expense of respiratory function.",
