Respiratory care includes using an incentive spirometer to maintain lung capacity and strengthen respiratory muscles, which weaken over time. Musculoskeletal management focuses on gentle passive range-of-motion to prevent joint contractures, a common and disabling complication. Nutrition is critical; preventing obesity is a priority as excess weight from decreased mobility and corticosteroid side effects further compromises ambulation. Corticosteroid therapy is a cornerstone treatment aimed at slowing the inflammatory process that leads to muscle fiber destruction, thereby preserving muscle function for longer. Finally, psychosocial support that promotes independence and self-care is essential for fostering coping mechanisms, self-esteem, and overall quality of life in the face of a chronic, progressive illness.",

Prophylactic antibiotics are not standard and can lead to resistance. High-impact activities can damage fragile muscles. A key nutritional concern is obesity, not a need for a ketogenic diet or fluid restriction in most cases. Corticosteroids cannot reverse damage or cure the genetic defect. Limiting a child's independence and avoiding honest communication are detrimental to their psychosocial development and coping abilities.",
