This is the most feared and life-threatening complication of alteplase therapy. The bleed is causing a significant increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to brainstem compression, which manifests as these specific neurological and vital sign changes.",
        "incorrect": "While other complications are possible, the specific constellation of symptoms points most directly to intracranial hemorrhage. Re-occlusion would likely present with worsening focal deficits, not global signs of increased ICP. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a possibility given the high blood pressure, but the bradycardia and focal neurological sign (unequal pupils) are more indicative of a space-occupying lesion. An allergic reaction would manifest with signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, which are not present.",

While this can occur after thrombolytic therapy, it would typically cause a recurrence or worsening of the initial focal neurological deficits (e.g., increased hemiparesis, worsening aphasia).

Although the client's blood pressure is severely elevated, the presence of bradycardia (HR 52 bpm) and a focal neurological sign (unilateral pupillary dilation) makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a more diffuse process, and while it causes headache and altered mental status, the combination of findings in this client is more specific to Cushing's triad, indicating brainstem compression from a focal mass effect like a hemorrhage.",
