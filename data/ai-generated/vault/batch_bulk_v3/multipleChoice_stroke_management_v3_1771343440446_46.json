    "correct": "The client's presentation of a sudden severe headache, decreased level of consciousness, unilateral pupillary dilation, and the presence of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) are classic signs of a rapidly expanding intracranial hemorrhage. This is the most feared and life-threatening complication of alteplase therapy. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. While beneficial in dissolving clots causing ischemic stroke, this mechanism also increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain. The bleed is causing a significant increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to brainstem compression, which manifests as these specific neurological and vital sign changes. The expanding hematoma compresses brain tissue, leading to herniation if not promptly addressed.",
    "incorrect": "While other complications are possible, the specific constellation of symptoms points most directly to intracranial hemorrhage. Re-occlusion would likely present with worsening focal deficits, not global signs of increased ICP. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a possibility given the high blood pressure, but the bradycardia and focal neurological sign (unequal pupils) are more indicative of a space-occupying lesion. An allergic reaction would manifest with signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, which are not present.",

        "content": "Re-occlusion of the cerebral artery is incorrect. While this can occur after thrombolytic therapy, it would typically cause a recurrence or worsening of the initial focal neurological deficits (e.g., increased hemiparesis, worsening aphasia). It does not classically present with the triad of severe headache, bradycardia, and pupillary changes, which are hallmark signs of increased intracranial pressure.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Intracranial hemorrhage is correct. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that works by dissolving clots, which carries a significant risk of bleeding. The client's symptoms—a sudden, explosive headache ('thunderclap' headache), a rapid decline in consciousness, bradycardia, severe hypertension, and a unilaterally sluggish and dilated pupil—are classic indicators of an acute bleed in the brain, which is causing a dangerous rise in intracranial pressure (ICP). The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the cranial compartment is a fixed volume, and an increase in one component (blood, brain tissue, or cerebrospinal fluid) must be compensated by a decrease in another. In this case, the expanding hematoma increases ICP, leading to brainstem compression and potential herniation.",

        "label": "C",
        "content": "An allergic reaction to alteplase is incorrect. A severe allergic reaction or angioedema would present with symptoms such as orolingual swelling, urticaria (hives), stridor, wheezing, and hypotension. The client's signs and symptoms are exclusively neurological and cardiovascular, pointing to a central nervous system catastrophe, not a systemic allergic response.",

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Hypertensive encephalopathy is incorrect. Although the client's blood pressure is severely elevated, the presence of bradycardia (HR 52 bpm) and a focal neurological sign (unilateral pupillary dilation) makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a more diffuse process, and while it causes headache and altered mental status, the combination of findings in this client is more specific to Cushing's triad, indicating brainstem compression from a focal mass effect like a hemorrhage. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the elevated blood pressure exceeds the brain's autoregulatory capacity, leading to cerebral edema and increased ICP, but typically without focal neurological deficits early on.",

  "clinicalPearl": "After administering alteplase (tPA), closely monitor the client for signs of intracranial hemorrhage, including sudden headache, altered level of consciousness, pupillary changes, and vital sign changes indicative of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations). Time is critical; immediate intervention, including stopping the alteplase infusion and obtaining a STAT CT scan, is crucial. Prepare for potential administration of reversal agents and interventions to manage increased ICP.",

    "situation": "At 1700, a 72-year-old client who received alteplase (tPA) at 1400 for an acute ischemic stroke is exhibiting new concerning symptoms.",
    "background": "The client is being monitored for complications post-alteplase administration. The initial stroke was confirmed via CT scan prior to alteplase administration.",
    "assessment": "The client reports a sudden, severe headache (10/10), is increasingly drowsy and difficult to arouse, and has unequal pupils (right 5mm sluggish, left 3mm brisk). Vital signs: BP 198/105 mmHg, HR 52 bpm, RR 12 and irregular, SpO2 94% on room air. These findings are indicative of increased intracranial pressure.",
    "recommendation": "I am highly concerned about a possible intracranial hemorrhage secondary to alteplase administration. I recommend the following STAT: neurological evaluation by neurology or neurosurgery, CT scan of the head without contrast to confirm hemorrhage, discontinue alteplase infusion immediately, and preparation for potential interventions to manage increased intracranial pressure, including possible administration of reversal agents (e.g., cryoprecipitate, tranexamic acid) per physician order."
