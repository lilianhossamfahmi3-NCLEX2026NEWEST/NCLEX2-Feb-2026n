At 1010, ten minutes into the initial infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam, the client reports diffuse pruritus and a sensation of throat tightness. The nurse assesses the client and notes the findings in the exhibit. Which action should the nurse take **first**?",

This reaction occurs when the body is exposed to an allergen (in this case, potentially the antibiotic), triggering mast cell and basophil degranulation. This releases histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators, leading to vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and potentially, laryngeal edema. Removing the source of the allergen is crucial to halt the progression of the reaction. Clinical Pearl: Always remain vigilant for signs of anaphylaxis when administering new medications, especially antibiotics. Have emergency equipment readily available.",

        "rationale": "While administering epinephrine is a crucial intervention in anaphylaxis to counteract vasodilation and bronchoconstriction, it is not the *initial* action. Epinephrine acts as a non-selective alpha and beta-adrenergic agonist. Alpha-1 agonism causes vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and decreasing mucosal edema. Beta-1 agonism increases heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output. Beta-2 agonism causes bronchodilation, improving airflow. However, if the allergen continues to be administered, the effects of epinephrine will be limited. Clinical Pearl: Epinephrine is typically administered intramuscularly in the mid-outer thigh. Monitor the client closely for adverse effects such as tachycardia and hypertension.",

Fluid resuscitation helps to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. However, like oxygen administration, it is a supportive measure and does not address the underlying cause of the reaction. The infusion must be stopped first.
