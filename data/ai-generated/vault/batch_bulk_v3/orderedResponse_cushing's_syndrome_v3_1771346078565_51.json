    "question_text": "A nurse in an endocrine unit is admitting a 48-year-old client with a new diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome secondary to a pituitary adenoma. The client reports feeling 'weak and puffy' and has noticeable facial plethora and multiple ecchymoses on the forearms. The provider has written initial admission orders. The nurse must prioritize which actions to take first. Drag the nursing actions on the left into the box on the right, arranging them in the correct order of priority from highest (1) to lowest (5).",

        "correct_response_explanation": "The correct order of nursing actions follows the nursing process and prioritizes patient safety. The initial step is always assessment to identify immediate life-threatening conditions (hypertension, hyperglycemia). This is followed by implementing immediate safety measures (fall precautions) based on the assessment findings of muscle weakness. Subsequent actions involve collecting further baseline data (weight, skin integrity) to monitor for complications. Finally, planning and education, such as a dietary consult, are addressed once the client is stable and immediate risks are mitigated.",

                "rank": 1,
                "rationale": "This is the highest priority. The nursing process begins with assessment. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by hypertension, hyperglycemia, and potential fluid volume excess, which can lead to orthostatic changes. Obtaining vital signs and a blood glucose level establishes a baseline and identifies any immediate life-threatening conditions that require urgent intervention."

                "option_id": "opt_02",
                "rank": 2,
                "rationale": "This is the second priority. After the initial assessment confirms risk factors like muscle weakness and potential orthostatic hypotension, ensuring patient safety is paramount. Cortisol-induced protein catabolism leads to muscle wasting and weakness, while osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures. Implementing fall precautions directly addresses this high-risk safety issue."

                "rank": 3,
                "rationale": "This is the third priority. Obtaining a baseline weight is a critical assessment for monitoring fluid retention, a hallmark of Cushing's syndrome due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects. While essential, it is prioritized after immediate physiological assessment and safety interventions are in place."

                "rank": 4,
                "rationale": "This is the fourth priority. Excess cortisol leads to thin, fragile skin, poor wound healing, and easy bruising. A comprehensive skin assessment is crucial for preventing infection and skin breakdown. This action is important but follows the more immediate priorities of hemodynamic stability, safety, and fluid balance assessment."

                "rationale": "This is the lowest priority among the given options. While dietary management is a key component of care for Cushing's syndrome to manage hypertension, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia, it is a collaborative and educational action. It is appropriately planned after immediate assessments and safety measures have been fully addressed."
