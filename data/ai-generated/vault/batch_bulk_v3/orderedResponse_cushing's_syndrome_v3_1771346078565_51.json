  "question_text": "A nurse in an endocrine unit is admitting a 48-year-old client with a new diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome secondary to a pituitary adenoma. The client reports feeling 'weak and puffy' and has noticeable facial plethora and multiple ecchymoses on the forearms. The provider has written initial admission orders. The nurse must prioritize which actions to take first. Drag the nursing actions on the left into the box on the right, arranging them in the correct order of priority from highest (1) to lowest (5).",

    "correct_response_explanation": "The correct order prioritizes immediate physiological stability and safety, followed by data collection and long-term management. Initial assessment identifies urgent needs. Safety measures are then implemented. Baseline data is collected to monitor disease progression and treatment effectiveness. Finally, long-term management strategies are initiated.",

      {
        "option_id": "opt_03",
        "rank": 1,
        "rationale": "CORRECT: Assessing vital signs and blood glucose is the highest priority. Cushing's syndrome causes hypercortisolism, leading to hypertension (increased sodium and water retention), hyperglycemia (increased gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance), and potential hypokalemia. Orthostatic hypotension may be present due to fluid shifts or medication effects. Rapid assessment allows for prompt intervention to stabilize the client. Clinical Pearl: Untreated hypertension and hyperglycemia can lead to cardiovascular complications and increased risk of infection.",

      {
        "option_id": "opt_02",
        "rank": 2,
        "rationale": "CORRECT: Implementing fall precautions is the next priority. Cushing's syndrome causes muscle weakness (protein catabolism) and osteoporosis (increased bone resorption), increasing the risk of falls and fractures. Orthostatic hypotension can also contribute. Clinical Pearl: Ensure the client understands the fall precautions and uses assistive devices if needed.",
        "correct": true

      {
        "option_id": "opt_05",
        "rank": 3,
        "rationale": "CORRECT: Obtaining a baseline weight is important for monitoring fluid retention, a common manifestation of Cushing's syndrome due to the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol. Weight gain can also indicate disease progression or treatment side effects. Clinical Pearl: Weigh the client at the same time each day, using the same scale, for accurate monitoring.",
        "correct": true
      },
      {
        "option_id": "opt_04",
        "rank": 4,
        "rationale": "CORRECT: A thorough skin assessment is crucial. Excess cortisol causes thinning of the skin, making it fragile and prone to breakdown and bruising (ecchymoses). Bony prominences are at increased risk for pressure ulcers. Clinical Pearl: Implement pressure-reducing strategies and meticulous skin care to prevent complications.",
        "correct": true

      {
        "option_id": "opt_01",
        "rank": 5,
        "rationale": "CORRECT: Initiating a dietary consultation is important for long-term management but is the lowest priority in this initial admission phase. A low-sodium diet helps manage hypertension and fluid retention, while a high-potassium diet addresses potential hypokalemia. Clinical Pearl: Dietary changes should be implemented gradually and tailored to the client's individual needs and preferences.",

    "Assessment": "Client presents with signs and symptoms consistent with hypercortisolism. Requires assessment of vital signs, blood glucose, and skin integrity. Fall risk is elevated due to muscle weakness.",
