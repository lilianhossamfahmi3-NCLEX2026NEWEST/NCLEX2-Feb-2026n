The fact that the sensation is new and has been 'ascending' (progressing from the feet to the knees) is a key indicator of an active and evolving neurological event consistent with demyelination along the spinal cord."

The change in motor strength from 5/5 (normal) at his baseline visit to 4/5 (movement against gravity with some resistance) in the lower extremities is a significant new motor deficit. This objective finding points to new demyelination affecting the motor pathways in the brain or spinal cord, a clear sign of an MS relapse."
