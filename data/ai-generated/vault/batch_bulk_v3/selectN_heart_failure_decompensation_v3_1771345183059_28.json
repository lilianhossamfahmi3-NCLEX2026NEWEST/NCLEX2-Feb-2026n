    "scenario": "A 28-year-old male with a history of viral cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presents to the emergency department (ED) with acute shortness of breath. The client reports feeling well until two days ago when he developed a cough and increasing dyspnea. He now requires three pillows to sleep and has new swelling in his feet. The client appears anxious, is diaphoretic, and is using accessory muscles to breathe.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3, anxious.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, S1/S2/S3 audible, 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to mid-shin.\n*   **Respiratory:** Labored breathing, bibasilar crackles audible 1/2 way up the posterior lung fields.\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n*   Heart Rate: 122 bpm\n*   Blood Pressure: 158/96 mmHg\n*   Respiratory Rate: 28 breaths/min\n*   SpO2: 89% on room air\n*   Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)",

            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "This action is contraindicated. The client is experiencing acute fluid volume overload, evidenced by bibasilar crackles and pitting edema. Administering an isotonic fluid bolus would increase intravascular volume, worsen pulmonary congestion, and exacerbate respiratory distress."

        "opt_3": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position, with legs dependent if possible, uses gravity to reduce venous return to the heart (preload). This decreases pulmonary congestion and allows for maximum chest expansion, easing the work of breathing."

        "opt_4": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Intravenous loop diuretics, such as furosemide, are a cornerstone of treatment for acute decompensated heart failure with fluid overload. Furosemide promotes rapid diuresis, which reduces intravascular volume, decreases preload, and alleviates pulmonary edema."

        "opt_5": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "While beta-blockers like metoprolol are essential for chronic HFrEF management, they are often held during an acute decompensation. Their negative inotropic effects can decrease cardiac output and worsen the client's hemodynamic status in the acute phase."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Incentive spirometry is used to prevent atelectasis and improve lung expansion, but it is not a priority during acute respiratory distress. The client is tachypneic and using accessory muscles; they would be unable to perform the deep, controlled breathing required and this action would not resolve the underlying fluid issue."
        },
        "opt_7": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Establishing reliable intravenous access is crucial. A second large-bore IV is a priority action to ensure a patent line is available for administering multiple, potentially incompatible emergency medications (e.g., diuretics, vasodilators, inotropes) and for rapid access if the client's condition changes."
        }
    },
    "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema (hypoxemia, tachypnea, crackles, edema). Immediate nursing actions must focus on improving oxygenation, reducing cardiac workload, and removing excess fluid. Correct actions include applying high-flow oxygen, placing the client in an upright position, administering IV diuretics, and ensuring adequate IV access for further interventions. Actions that would worsen the client's condition (fluid bolus, administering a beta-blocker) or are not a priority in the acute phase (incentive spirometry) are incorrect.",
