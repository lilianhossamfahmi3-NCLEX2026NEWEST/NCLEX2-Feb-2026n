    "rationale": "The priority in lithium toxicity is to address life-threatening complications and enhance lithium excretion. This involves continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias, fluid resuscitation to improve renal perfusion and lithium clearance, obtaining an ECG to assess cardiac function, implementing seizure precautions due to neurotoxicity, and preparing for hemodialysis, the definitive treatment for severe toxicity.",

      {
        "optionId": "opt_1",
        "order": 1,
        "explanation": "**+** Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring is the priority due to the risk of lithium-induced cardiotoxicity. Lithium can disrupt cardiac ion channels, leading to arrhythmias such as bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, and T-wave abnormalities. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection and management of life-threatening dysrhythmias. **Pathophysiology:** Lithium affects the sodium and potassium channels in cardiac cells, altering the action potential and potentially leading to arrhythmias. Early detection is crucial to prevent cardiac arrest."

        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "order": 2,
        "explanation": "**+** Administering a 0.9% sodium chloride bolus is essential for fluid resuscitation. The client presents with dehydration (elevated BUN, dry mucous membranes) and hyponatremia, both of which exacerbate lithium toxicity. IV fluids increase renal perfusion, promoting lithium excretion. Sodium also competes with lithium for reabsorption in the proximal tubules, further enhancing lithium clearance. **Pathophysiology:** Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Dehydration reduces renal blood flow, decreasing lithium clearance. Hyponatremia causes the kidneys to retain lithium to maintain sodium balance, worsening toxicity. Fluid resuscitation restores renal function and promotes lithium excretion."

        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "order": 3,
        "explanation": "**+** Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important to assess for specific cardiac abnormalities associated with lithium toxicity. ECG changes can include prolonged QT interval, T-wave inversions, and ST-segment depression. These findings guide further cardiac management and risk stratification. **Pathophysiology:** Lithium's effects on cardiac ion channels can manifest as specific ECG changes. Prolonged QT interval increases the risk of torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression indicate myocardial ischemia or injury."

        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "order": 4,
        "explanation": "**+** Implementing seizure precautions is necessary due to the client's altered mental status (lethargy) and high lithium level, which increase the risk of seizures. Seizure precautions include padding the side rails, having suction equipment readily available, and ensuring the client is in a safe environment. **Pathophysiology:** Lithium neurotoxicity can lower the seizure threshold by disrupting neuronal excitability. High lithium levels increase the likelihood of seizures, which can lead to hypoxia and further neurological damage."

      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "order": 5,
        "explanation": "**+** Anticipating and preparing for potential hemodialysis is crucial as hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity, especially with neurological symptoms and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine). This involves notifying the nephrology team, ensuring appropriate IV access is available, and preparing the client for the procedure. **Pathophysiology:** Hemodialysis effectively removes lithium from the bloodstream, rapidly reducing serum lithium levels and alleviating toxicity. It is indicated when conservative measures (hydration) are insufficient or when severe symptoms are present."
