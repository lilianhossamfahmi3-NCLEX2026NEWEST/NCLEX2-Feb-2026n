    "question": "A 48-year-old male client with bipolar I disorder is brought to the emergency department by his spouse due to increasing confusion, severe hand tremors, and ataxia. The spouse reports the client recently had a gastrointestinal illness and has been taking an over-the-counter NSAID for muscle aches. The nurse reviews the client's data. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag and drop the options from the left to the right to specify the order of interventions.",

Coarse tremors present in bilateral upper extremities. Mucous membranes are dry. Spouse reports client has had vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days and started taking ibuprofen yesterday.

        "rationale": "The nurse must prioritize interventions based on immediate safety needs and standard treatment protocols for severe lithium toxicity. The correct order is to first address immediate life threats (cardiac instability), then initiate primary treatment (hydration), followed by obtaining further diagnostic data (ECG), implementing preventative safety measures (seizure precautions), and finally preparing for definitive treatment (hemodialysis).",

                "order": 1,
                "explanation": "Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring is the first priority. Lithium toxicity can cause significant cardiotoxic effects, including arrhythmias, bradycardia, and T-wave changes. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection of life-threatening dysrhythmias, which is a critical first step in ensuring patient safety."

            {

                "order": 2,
                "explanation": "Administering a 0.9% sodium chloride bolus is the next step. The client's dehydration (tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN) and hyponatremia exacerbated the lithium toxicity. Intravenous hydration is the primary treatment to restore fluid volume, correct electrolyte imbalances, and promote the renal excretion of lithium."

                "order": 3,
                "explanation": "Obtaining a 12-lead ECG is the third action. While continuous monitoring is ongoing, a 12-lead ECG provides a detailed diagnostic baseline to identify specific cardiotoxic effects such as QTc interval prolongation or T-wave inversion. This information is crucial for risk stratification and guiding further cardiac management."

            {

                "order": 4,
                "explanation": "Implementing seizure precautions is the fourth priority. The client's severe neurotoxicity (lethargy, confusion, ataxia) and high lithium level (2.8 mEq/L) place them at significant risk for seizures. This is a proactive safety measure to prevent injury if a seizure occurs."

                "order": 5,
                "explanation": "Anticipating and preparing for potential hemodialysis is the final action in this sequence. Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity, especially with significant neurologic symptoms and acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.9 mg/dL). After initial stabilization measures are underway, the nurse must prepare for this intervention, which may involve notifying the nephrology team and ensuring appropriate IV access is available."
