  "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 52-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder who has been taking lithium carbonate for several years. The client's partner reports the client has had 'the stomach flu' for three days and seems increasingly unsteady and confused. The client was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Which of the following assessment findings should the nurse recognize as potential indicators of lithium toxicity? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The correct options indicate neurotoxicity and neuromuscular irritability characteristic of lithium toxicity. Concurrent illness causing dehydration (diarrhea/vomiting) and the addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) are significant risk factors for developing toxicity, as both can decrease lithium clearance by the kidneys. The nurse must recognize the cluster of neurological signs (ataxia, coarse tremors, muscle fasciculations) as classic indicators of a dangerously elevated lithium level.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent either symptoms of the underlying psychiatric disorder (mania), expected long-term side effects of lithium that are not indicative of acute toxicity, or unrelated cardiovascular findings. Differentiating between medication toxicity, side effects, and the disease process is a critical nursing skill.",

        "label": "B",
        "content": "This is correct. Ataxia (an unsteady, clumsy gait) and poor coordination are significant signs of central nervous system toxicity from elevated lithium levels. These neurological impairments typically emerge as lithium levels move from moderate to severe toxicity.",

        "content": "This is incorrect. Polyuria (increased urine output) and polydipsia (increased thirst) are common, long-term side effects of lithium therapy, often related to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. They are not signs of acute toxicity. In an acute toxicity scenario with vomiting and diarrhea, the client is more likely to be dehydrated with decreased urine output.",

    {
      "option": "B",
      "rationale": "Correct. Ataxia and poor coordination are significant signs of lithium toxicity affecting the central nervous system. Lithium toxicity disrupts neuronal function, leading to impaired motor control and balance. This occurs as lithium accumulates in the brain, interfering with neurotransmitter activity and cellular processes. The combination of dehydration from 'stomach flu' and hydrochlorothiazide use increases the risk of lithium accumulation.",

    },
    {
      "option": "D",
      "rationale": "Correct. While fine hand tremors are a common side effect of lithium, coarse hand tremors indicate neurotoxicity. Lithium interferes with neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. As lithium levels rise, the tremors become more pronounced and uncoordinated, reflecting a worsening neurological state. This warrants immediate intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "option": "E",
      "rationale": "Correct. Muscle fasciculations are a sign of neuromuscular irritability due to lithium toxicity. Lithium affects the sodium-potassium pump and calcium channels, disrupting muscle cell membrane stability and leading to spontaneous muscle contractions. This neuromuscular excitability is a key indicator of elevated lithium levels and potential for more severe neurological complications.",

Increased urine output and thirst (polyuria/polydipsia) are common long-term side effects of lithium, often related to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, where the kidneys become less responsive to ADH.
