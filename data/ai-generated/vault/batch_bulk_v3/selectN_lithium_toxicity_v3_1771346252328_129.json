    "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 52-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder who has been taking lithium carbonate for several years. The client's partner reports the client has had 'the stomach flu' for three days and seems increasingly unsteady and confused. The client was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Which of the following assessment findings should the nurse recognize as potential indicators of lithium toxicity? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The correct options indicate neurotoxicity and neuromuscular irritability characteristic of lithium toxicity. Concurrent illness causing dehydration (diarrhea/vomiting) and the addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) are significant risk factors for developing toxicity, as both can decrease lithium clearance by the kidneys. The nurse must recognize the cluster of neurological signs (ataxia, coarse tremors, muscle fasciculations) as classic indicators of a dangerously elevated lithium level.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent either symptoms of the underlying psychiatric disorder (mania), expected long-term side effects of lithium that are not indicative of acute toxicity, or unrelated cardiovascular findings. Differentiating between medication toxicity, side effects, and the disease process is a critical nursing skill.",

Polyuria (increased urine output) and polydipsia (increased thirst) are common, long-term side effects of lithium therapy, often related to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
