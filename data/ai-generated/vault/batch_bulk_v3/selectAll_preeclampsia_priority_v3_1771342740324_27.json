    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of worsening severe preeclampsia and is at imminent risk for an eclamptic seizure and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The cluster of signs—severe hypertension (184/118 mmHg), neurological irritability (pounding headache, hyperreflexia, clonus), and signs of end-organ damage (epigastric pain indicating liver involvement, oliguria indicating kidney involvement)—requires immediate, multi-faceted intervention. The priorities are to manage the acute, severe hypertension to prevent a stroke (administer hydralazine), protect the client from injury if a seizure occurs (implement seizure precautions), urgently communicate the critical findings to the provider to facilitate further orders and decisions (notify HCP), and anticipate the definitive treatment, which is delivery (prepare for C-section). These actions address the life-threatening complications for both the mother and fetus. In preeclampsia, vasospasms and endothelial damage lead to decreased organ perfusion and increased vascular permeability. This results in hypertension, proteinuria, edema, and potential end-organ damage. The central nervous system is particularly vulnerable, leading to headaches, visual disturbances, and seizures. The liver can be affected, causing epigastric pain and elevated liver enzymes. The kidneys may exhibit decreased glomerular filtration rate, leading to oliguria.",
    "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is an inappropriate intervention as the headache is a symptom of cerebral edema and vasospasm, not a simple analgesic issue; treating the underlying cause (severe hypertension) is the priority. Increasing the maintenance IV fluids is contraindicated and dangerous. Clients with severe preeclampsia have leaky capillaries and are at high risk for third-spacing and pulmonary edema; increasing fluid volume can exacerbate this.",

        "content": "This is incorrect. The client's pounding headache is a neurological symptom of severe preeclampsia, indicating cerebral irritation and vasospasm. It is not a tension or migraine headache. Administering acetaminophen fails to address the underlying life-threatening pathophysiology and provides a false sense of security while delaying critical interventions like antihypertensive administration. **Pathophysiology:** In preeclampsia, cerebral vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction lead to increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema, causing a severe headache. Acetaminophen does not address the underlying cause of the headache.",

The significant change in the client's condition, including a dangerously high blood pressure, new-onset epigastric pain, and pronounced signs of central nervous system irritability (hyperreflexia, clonus), constitutes a medical emergency. Notifying the healthcare provider immediately is critical for collaborative management and escalation of care, including orders for emergency medications and preparation for delivery. **Pathophysiology:** Rapid deterioration in preeclampsia indicates worsening end-organ damage and increased risk of complications such as eclampsia, stroke, and placental abruption. Prompt communication ensures timely intervention to mitigate these risks.",

In severe preeclampsia, endothelial damage leads to increased capillary permeability and third-spacing of fluid, putting the client at high risk for pulmonary edema. Increasing the rate of IV fluids would increase intravascular volume and hydrostatic pressure, further pushing fluid into the interstitial spaces and lungs, which can be life-threatening. **Pathophysiology:** The damaged endothelium in preeclampsia allows fluid to leak from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, leading to edema and potentially pulmonary edema. Increasing IV fluids exacerbates this fluid shift.",

This level of hypertension places the client at immediate risk for a hemorrhagic stroke or placental abruption. Administering a rapid-acting IV antihypertensive, such as hydralazine or labetalol, is a priority action to lower the blood pressure to a safer range. **Pathophysiology:** Severe hypertension in preeclampsia can cause rupture of cerebral blood vessels (hemorrhagic stroke) or separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption), both of which are life-threatening emergencies. Antihypertensive medications reduce the risk of these complications.",

The definitive cure for preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Given the severity of the symptoms (imminent eclampsia, end-organ damage), the nurse must anticipate and prepare for an emergency cesarean delivery to save the lives of both the mother and the fetus. **Pathophysiology:** Delivery removes the source of the preeclampsia (the placenta) and allows the mother's condition to stabilize. In severe cases, delaying delivery can lead to irreversible organ damage or death for both mother and fetus.",

The presence of hyperreflexia (+4 DTRs) and clonus, combined with a severe headache, are classic signs of extreme central nervous system irritability and indicate that the client is on the verge of an eclamptic seizure. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padding side rails, ensuring oxygen and suction are at the bedside, minimizing stimuli) is a crucial safety measure to prevent injury. **Pathophysiology:** Cerebral edema and increased neuronal excitability in preeclampsia can lead to seizures (eclampsia). Seizure precautions minimize the risk of injury during a seizure.",
