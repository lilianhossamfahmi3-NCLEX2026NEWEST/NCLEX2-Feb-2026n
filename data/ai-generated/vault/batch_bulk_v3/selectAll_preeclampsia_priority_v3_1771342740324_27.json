    "prompt": "A 34-year-old client at 36 weeks gestation, admitted for severe preeclampsia, is receiving a magnesium sulfate infusion. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following changes over the last hour: blood pressure increased from 162/110 mmHg to 184/118 mmHg, heart rate is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and SpO2 is 97% on room air. The client reports a 'pounding' headache, rates it 8/10, and complains of new-onset epigastric pain. The nurse assesses 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are +4 with 3 beats of clonus, and urine output via indwelling catheter was 20 mL in the last hour. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of worsening severe preeclampsia and is at imminent risk for an eclamptic seizure and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The cluster of signs—severe hypertension (184/118 mmHg), neurological irritability (pounding headache, hyperreflexia, clonus), and signs of end-organ damage (epigastric pain indicating liver involvement, oliguria indicating kidney involvement)—requires immediate, multi-faceted intervention. The priorities are to manage the acute, severe hypertension to prevent a stroke (administer hydralazine), protect the client from injury if a seizure occurs (implement seizure precautions), urgently communicate the critical findings to the provider to facilitate further orders and decisions (notify HCP), and anticipate the definitive treatment, which is delivery (prepare for C-section). These actions address the life-threatening complications for both the mother and fetus.",
        "incorrect": "Administering acetaminophen is an inappropriate intervention as the headache is a symptom of cerebral edema and vasospasm, not a simple analgesic issue; treating the underlying cause (severe hypertension) is the priority. Increasing the maintenance IV fluids is contraindicated and dangerous. Clients with severe preeclampsia have leaky capillaries and are at high risk for third-spacing and pulmonary edema; increasing fluid volume can exacerbate this.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. The client's pounding headache is a neurological symptom of severe preeclampsia, indicating cerebral irritation and vasospasm. It is not a tension or migraine headache. Administering acetaminophen fails to address the underlying life-threatening pathophysiology and provides a false sense of security while delaying critical interventions like antihypertensive administration.",

The significant change in the client's condition, including a dangerously high blood pressure, new-onset epigastric pain, and pronounced signs of central nervous system irritability (hyperreflexia, clonus), constitutes a medical emergency. Notifying the healthcare provider immediately is critical for collaborative management and escalation of care, including orders for emergency medications and preparation for delivery.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. In severe preeclampsia, endothelial damage leads to increased capillary permeability and third-spacing of fluid, putting the client at high risk for pulmonary edema. Increasing the rate of IV fluids would increase intravascular volume and hydrostatic pressure, further pushing fluid into the interstitial spaces and lungs, which can be life-threatening.",

This level of hypertension places the client at immediate risk for a hemorrhagic stroke or placental abruption. Administering a rapid-acting IV antihypertensive, such as hydralazine or labetalol, is a priority action to lower the blood pressure to a safer range.",

The definitive cure for preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Given the severity of the symptoms (imminent eclampsia, end-organ damage), the nurse must anticipate and prepare for an emergency cesarean delivery to save the lives of both the mother and the fetus.",

The presence of hyperreflexia (+4 DTRs) and clonus, combined with a severe headache, are classic signs of extreme central nervous system irritability and indicate that the client is on the verge of an eclamptic seizure.
