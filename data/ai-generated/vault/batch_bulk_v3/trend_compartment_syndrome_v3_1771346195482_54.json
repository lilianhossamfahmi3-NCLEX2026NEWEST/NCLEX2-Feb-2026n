Pain that is disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by standard analgesia (especially opioids) is the cardinal and earliest sign of acute compartment syndrome.

Arterial pressure is typically much higher than the pressure within the compartment, so pulses can remain palpable until very late stages when irreversible damage has already occurred. The absence of a pulse (pulselessness) is a very late and ominous sign."

As fluid accumulates and pressure builds within the enclosed fascial compartment, the overlying skin becomes tense, cool, pale, and may appear shiny. The trend from 'moderate edema' to 'tense' and 'very tense and shiny' reflects this progression."
