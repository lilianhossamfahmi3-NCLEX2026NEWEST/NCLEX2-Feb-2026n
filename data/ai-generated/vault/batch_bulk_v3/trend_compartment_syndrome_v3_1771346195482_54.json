      "rationale": "This finding is consistent with acute compartment syndrome. The hallmark of compartment syndrome is pain out of proportion to the injury, often described as deep, throbbing, and unrelenting, even with opioid analgesics. Pathophysiologically, increased pressure within the fascial compartment compromises microcirculation, leading to muscle ischemia and nerve compression. Ischemic pain fibers are stimulated, resulting in intense pain signals that are difficult to manage with conventional pain medications. Clinical Pearl: Always investigate pain that is not relieved by analgesia, especially in patients at risk for compartment syndrome.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "row_2": {
      "column": "col_1",
      "rationale": "This finding is consistent with acute compartment syndrome. Paresthesia (tingling, burning, or prickling sensation) is an early neurological sign resulting from nerve compression within the affected compartment. As pressure increases, nerve ischemia develops, leading to altered sensory function. The progression from intact sensation to tingling and then numbness indicates worsening nerve compromise. Pathophysiologically, sustained pressure on nerve fibers disrupts their ability to transmit signals effectively. Clinical Pearl: Assess sensory function frequently and document any changes, as early detection of paresthesia can prevent irreversible nerve damage.",

    },
    "row_3": {
      "column": "col_1",
      "rationale": "This finding is consistent with acute compartment syndrome. Pain with passive extension of the toes is a classic sign. When the muscles within the compartment are stretched, the increased pressure causes intense pain due to ischemia and compression of the muscle tissue. Pathophysiologically, passive stretching increases the pressure within the already compromised compartment, further exacerbating ischemia and stimulating pain receptors. Clinical Pearl: Pain with passive stretch is a reliable indicator, even when other signs are subtle.",
      "correct": true

    "row_4": {
      "column": "col_2",
      "rationale": "This finding is not consistent with acute compartment syndrome. The presence of a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse does NOT rule out compartment syndrome. Arterial pressure is typically higher than the compartment pressure, especially in the early stages. Pulselessness is a late and ominous sign, indicating severe arterial compromise. Pathophysiologically, compartment pressures must exceed arterial pressure to occlude the artery. Clinical Pearl: Relying solely on pulse assessment can be misleading. Absence of pulse is a late sign.",

    "row_5": {
      "column": "col_1",
      "rationale": "This finding is consistent with acute compartment syndrome. Progressive motor weakness indicates worsening nerve ischemia and muscle damage. The trend from full ROM to weakness and then inability to move toes reflects increasing nerve compression and muscle dysfunction. Pathophysiologically, prolonged ischemia leads to muscle infarction and nerve damage, resulting in motor deficits. Clinical Pearl: Assess motor function frequently and document any decline, as early intervention can prevent permanent disability.",

      "column": "col_1",
      "rationale": "This finding is consistent with acute compartment syndrome. As pressure increases within the compartment, the skin becomes tense, cool, pale, and shiny due to edema and compromised microcirculation. The trend from moderate edema to tense and shiny skin reflects the progressive increase in pressure. Pathophysiologically, increased interstitial fluid and compression of superficial blood vessels contribute to these skin changes. Clinical Pearl: Observe the skin for changes in color, temperature, and texture, as these can indicate worsening compartment syndrome.",
