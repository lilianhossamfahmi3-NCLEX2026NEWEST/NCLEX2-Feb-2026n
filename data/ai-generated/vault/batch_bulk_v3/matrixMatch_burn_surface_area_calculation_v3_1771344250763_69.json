    "correct": "The Rule of Nines is a rapid assessment tool estimating the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults. It assigns percentages to body regions: entire anterior torso (18%), entire arm (9%), anterior head/neck (4.5%), and perineum (1%). Accurate TBSA calculation guides fluid resuscitation, preventing burn shock (hypovolemia due to massive fluid shifts from damaged capillaries). Inadequate resuscitation leads to organ failure; over-resuscitation causes pulmonary edema and compartment syndrome. This client's TBSA is 32.5% (18% + 9% + 4.5% + 1%).",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect TBSA calculation leads to inappropriate fluid resuscitation. Underestimation results in hypovolemic shock and organ damage due to inadequate perfusion. Overestimation can cause fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Errors often involve misidentifying body regions or confusing partial vs. full body area percentages.",
