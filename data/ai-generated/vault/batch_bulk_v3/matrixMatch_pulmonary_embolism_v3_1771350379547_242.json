Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 86%) requires immediate high-flow oxygen delivery. Hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg) signifies obstructive shock and requires immediate escalation by activating the RRT. A therapeutic aPTT level indicates the current heparin dose is effective and should be documented. Finally, addressing the client's profound anxiety is a crucial psychosocial intervention that can also help reduce physiological stress.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect actions involve mis-prioritizing interventions or selecting an action that is not indicated or is potentially harmful. For example, activating the RRT for a therapeutic aPTT is unnecessary. Increasing the heparin rate when the aPTT is already therapeutic would increase the risk of bleeding. Providing only emotional support to a client with severe hypoxemia or hypotension fails to address the life-threatening physiological problem.",
