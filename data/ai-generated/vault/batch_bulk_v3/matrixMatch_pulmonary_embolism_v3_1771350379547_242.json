    "correct": "The nurse must prioritize interventions based on the severity of the client's signs and symptoms following a massive PE. Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 86%) and tachypnea (RR 34/min) require immediate high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask to maximize oxygen delivery. Hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 128/min) signify obstructive shock, necessitating immediate escalation by activating the RRT for advanced interventions like vasopressors. A therapeutic aPTT level (75 seconds) indicates the current heparin dose is effective and should be documented. Finally, addressing the client's profound anxiety is a crucial psychosocial intervention to reduce physiological stress and promote coping.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect actions involve mis-prioritizing interventions or selecting actions that are not indicated or are potentially harmful. Activating the RRT for a therapeutic aPTT is unnecessary. Increasing the heparin rate when the aPTT is already therapeutic increases bleeding risk. Providing only emotional support to a client with severe hypoxemia or hypotension fails to address life-threatening physiological problems.",
