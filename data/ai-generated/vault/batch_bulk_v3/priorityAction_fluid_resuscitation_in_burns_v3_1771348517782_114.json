    "prompt": "This question requires the nurse to prioritize care for a client with major burns and signs of inhalation injury, using the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework. The correct sequence addresses immediate life threats first.",

        "id": "blank_1",
        "key": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Correct. The first priority is to address the client's breathing and oxygenation. An SpO2 of 93% on room air, tachypnea (RR 26), and signs of inhalation injury (soot, hoarse voice) indicate hypoxia and potential carbon monoxide poisoning. Applying a high-flow, non-rebreather mask at 100% FiO2 is the most immediate action to improve oxygenation and displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Inhalation of smoke and toxic gases leads to airway inflammation, bronchospasm, and impaired gas exchange. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with a much higher affinity than oxygen, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues and causing cellular hypoxia. High-flow oxygen helps to saturate hemoglobin with oxygen and competitively displace carbon monoxide.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always suspect inhalation injury in burn patients, especially those with facial burns, singed nasal hairs, or altered mental status. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent respiratory failure.",

        "rationale": "Correct. After initiating oxygen therapy, the next priority is securing the airway. A hoarse voice is a cardinal sign of laryngeal edema, which can rapidly progress to complete airway obstruction. The nurse must anticipate the need for intubation and prepare the necessary equipment and personnel immediately, before swelling makes the procedure impossible.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Inhalation of hot gases and chemicals causes direct thermal and chemical injury to the upper airway, leading to inflammation and edema. Laryngeal edema can rapidly compromise the airway, making intubation difficult or impossible if delayed. Early intubation secures the airway and allows for mechanical ventilation if needed.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the patient's voice and breathing sounds closely for signs of airway compromise. Stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing are all red flags that warrant immediate intervention.",

        "rationale": "Correct. With airway and breathing being addressed, the next priority is circulation. The client has an estimated 36% TBSA burn (entire anterior trunk 18% + both arms 9% each), placing them at high risk for distributive (burn) shock due to massive fluid shifts. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation, typically with two large-bore IVs and an isotonic crystalloid like lactated Ringer's, is critical to maintain tissue perfusion and prevent organ failure.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Burn injury causes increased capillary permeability, leading to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. This results in hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, and impaired tissue perfusion. Lactated Ringer's is an isotonic crystalloid solution that helps to restore intravascular volume and maintain blood pressure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use the Parkland formula (4 mL x %TBSA x weight in kg) to estimate the initial fluid resuscitation rate. Monitor urine output closely to assess the adequacy of fluid replacement.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Once fluid resuscitation is initiated, inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is the next step. This is not primarily for client comfort but is a critical tool for monitoring the adequacy of fluid replacement. Urine output is the most sensitive non-invasive indicator of end-organ perfusion, and resuscitation volumes are titrated to maintain an output of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Adequate urine output reflects adequate renal perfusion, which is essential for maintaining overall tissue perfusion and preventing acute kidney injury. Monitoring urine output allows for timely adjustments to fluid resuscitation to optimize hemodynamic stability.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor urine output hourly and adjust fluid resuscitation rates accordingly. Report any significant changes in urine output to the healthcare provider.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. While severe pain is a major issue in burn care, it is not an immediate threat to life. According to the ABC framework, managing pain comes after stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation. Furthermore, administering narcotics can cause respiratory depression, which is particularly dangerous in a client with a compromised airway.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Opioid analgesics can depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and tidal volume. This can worsen hypoxia and hypercapnia, especially in patients with underlying respiratory compromise.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always assess respiratory status before and after administering opioid analgesics. Consider using non-opioid analgesics or alternative pain management techniques to minimize the risk of respiratory depression.",

        "rationale": "Incorrect. Covering the wounds is important to prevent hypothermia and reduce the risk of infection. However, this action is performed after the immediate life-saving interventions of securing the airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation, and initiating fluid resuscitation have been completed.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Burn injury disrupts the skin's protective barrier, increasing the risk of infection and fluid loss. Covering the wounds with clean, dry dressings helps to prevent contamination and minimize evaporative heat loss.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use sterile technique when caring for burn wounds to minimize the risk of infection. Monitor the patient's temperature closely and take measures to prevent hypothermia.",
