An SpO2 of 93% on room air, tachypnea (RR 26), and signs of inhalation injury (soot, hoarse voice) indicate hypoxia and potential carbon monoxide poisoning. Applying a high-flow, non-rebreather mask at 100% FiO2 is the most immediate action to improve oxygenation and displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin."

                "rationale": "Correct. After initiating oxygen therapy, the next priority is securing the airway. A hoarse voice is a cardinal sign of laryngeal edema, which can rapidly progress to complete airway obstruction. The nurse must anticipate the need for intubation and prepare the necessary equipment and personnel immediately, before swelling makes the procedure impossible."

                "rationale": "Correct. With airway and breathing being addressed, the next priority is circulation. The client has an estimated 36% TBSA burn, placing them at high risk for distributive (burn) shock due to massive fluid shifts. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation, typically with two large-bore IVs and an isotonic crystalloid like lactated Ringer's, is critical to maintain tissue perfusion and prevent organ failure."

                "rationale": "Correct. Once fluid resuscitation is initiated, inserting an indwelling urinary catheter is the next step. This is not primarily for client comfort but is a critical tool for monitoring the adequacy of fluid replacement. Urine output is the most sensitive non-invasive indicator of end-organ perfusion, and resuscitation volumes are titrated to maintain an output of 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr."

According to the ABC framework, managing pain comes after stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation. Furthermore, administering narcotics can cause respiratory depression, which is particularly dangerous in a client with a compromised airway."

However, this action is performed after the immediate life-saving interventions of securing the airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation, and initiating fluid resuscitation have been completed."
