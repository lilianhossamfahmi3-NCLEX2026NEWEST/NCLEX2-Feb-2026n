The client was brought to the emergency department with severe, progressive muscle weakness, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and a respiratory rate of 28/min with shallow breaths. The client's partner states they 'ran out of their pyridostigmine medication yesterday.' Based on these cues, the nurse should formulate the plan of care recognizing the client is most likely experiencing a {{BLANK_1}}. The nurse anticipates that the provider may order a(n) {{BLANK_2}} to help differentiate the cause of the crisis. The highest priority action for the nurse to implement is to {{BLANK_3}}.",

        "correct": "The client's presentation of acute respiratory distress and severe muscle weakness, combined with the history of missing pyridostigmine doses, strongly indicates a myasthenic crisis due to undermedication. The priority diagnostic tool to differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crises is the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, where a temporary improvement in muscle strength confirms a myasthenic crisis. Given the signs of impending respiratory failure (tachypnea, shallow breaths, dysphagia), the absolute priority nursing action is to prepare for airway support via non-invasive ventilation or intubation to prevent respiratory arrest.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting cholinergic crisis is incorrect because it results from overmedication and typically presents with hypersecretions and parasympathetic symptoms (e.g., salivation, bradycardia, diarrhea), which are absent here. Other diagnostic tests are not used for acute crisis differentiation. While medication and positioning are important, they are secondary to securing a patent airway when respiratory compromise is evident.",
