  "stem": "The nurse is developing the initial plan of care for a 45-year-old client with a known history of myasthenia gravis. The client was brought to the emergency department at 1400 with severe, progressive muscle weakness, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and a respiratory rate of 28/min with shallow breaths. The client's partner states they 'ran out of their pyridostigmine medication yesterday.' Based on these cues, the nurse should formulate the plan of care recognizing the client is most likely experiencing a {{BLANK_1}}. The nurse anticipates that the provider may order a(n) {{BLANK_2}} to help differentiate the cause of the crisis. The highest priority action for the nurse to implement is to {{BLANK_3}}.",

    "correct": "The client's presentation (progressive muscle weakness, slurred speech, dysphagia, respiratory distress) combined with a history of myasthenia gravis and medication non-adherence strongly suggests a myasthenic crisis. This occurs due to insufficient acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, normally prevents the breakdown of ACh, increasing its availability. Without it, ACh levels plummet, leading to muscle weakness. The edrophonium (Tensilon) test helps differentiate between myasthenic and cholinergic crises by temporarily increasing ACh levels; improvement indicates myasthenic crisis. Given the respiratory compromise, preparing for ventilation is paramount. Myasthenic crisis can rapidly lead to respiratory failure due to weakness of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support oxygenation and ventilation.",
    "incorrect": "Cholinergic crisis results from excessive ACh due to overmedication with cholinesterase inhibitors, leading to SLUDGE symptoms (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI upset, Emesis). Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disorder causing ascending paralysis, not directly related to myasthenia gravis or medication non-adherence. Thyrotoxic crisis presents with hypermetabolic symptoms like fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Serum acetylcholine receptor antibody titer confirms the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis but doesn't differentiate between crises. Lumbar puncture is used for diagnosing neurological infections or demyelinating diseases. Chest CT may be used to evaluate for thymoma, but is not useful in the acute crisis. While pyridostigmine is needed, airway management is the priority. Atropine is used for cholinergic crisis. High-Fowler's position is helpful but insufficient for severe respiratory distress.",
