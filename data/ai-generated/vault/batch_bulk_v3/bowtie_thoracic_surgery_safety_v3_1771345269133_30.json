Chest tube drainage system shows tidaling with respirations and gentle bubbling in the air leak chamber. 150 mL of serosanguineous drainage in the collection chamber over the past 8 hours.\n\n**1030:** Client becomes acutely anxious and restless, reporting sudden, severe shortness of breath and sharp right-sided chest pain.

The pathophysiology involves a one-way valve effect where air enters the pleural space with each inspiration but cannot escape. This leads to increased intrapleural pressure, causing lung collapse on the affected side and a mediastinal shift (tracheal deviation) to the contralateral side. The compression of the mediastinum impairs venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypotension. The absent breath sounds on the right, coupled with tracheal deviation to the left, neck vein distention, tachycardia, and hypotension, strongly suggest a tension pneumothorax. Clinical Pearl: Tension pneumothorax requires immediate intervention to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death.",

While pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia, it does not typically present with unilateral absent breath sounds or tracheal deviation. PE involves a blood clot obstructing pulmonary blood flow, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. The assessment findings in this scenario are more specific to a pneumothorax.",

Needle decompression (thoracostomy) is the immediate, life-saving intervention for a tension pneumothorax. It involves inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to release the trapped air and relieve the pressure on the mediastinum. The nurse should gather the necessary equipment (large-bore needle, antiseptic solution, gloves) and assist the provider as needed.
