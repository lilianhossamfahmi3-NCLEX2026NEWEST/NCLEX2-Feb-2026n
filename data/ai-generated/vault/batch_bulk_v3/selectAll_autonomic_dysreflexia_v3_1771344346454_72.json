  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a life-threatening emergency unique to spinal cord injuries above T6. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the injury level, causing an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response. This leads to severe hypertension (BP >200/100 mmHg), bradycardia, headache, flushing, and diaphoresis above the lesion. The pathophysiology involves the inability of the brain to regulate the sympathetic outflow below the injury. The uninhibited sympathetic response causes vasoconstriction, leading to the hypertensive crisis. Immediate actions aim to reduce BP and remove the stimulus. High-Fowler's lowers BP via orthostatic hypotension. Loosening constrictive clothing removes potential triggers. Bladder distention is a common cause; assess catheter patency. Antihypertensives are given if BP remains elevated despite other interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect options either worsen the hypertension or fail to address the underlying cause. Supine positioning increases blood return to the heart, further elevating BP and increasing the risk of stroke. Analgesics do not treat the hypertension; they only mask the symptom. Addressing the cause of the AD is the priority.",
