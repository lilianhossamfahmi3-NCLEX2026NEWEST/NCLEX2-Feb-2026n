    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 34-year-old client with a T4 spinal cord injury. The client suddenly reports a 'pounding' headache and nausea. The nurse's assessment reveals: blood pressure 202/110 mmHg, heart rate 48/min, facial flushing, and profuse diaphoresis above the level of the injury. The client appears anxious and restless. Which actions should the nurse implement immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency characterized by an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response to a noxious stimulus below the level of a T6 or higher spinal cord injury. Immediate interventions are aimed at lowering the dangerously high blood pressure and removing the offending stimulus. Key actions include sitting the client upright to induce orthostatic hypotension, removing any constrictive items, identifying and resolving the stimulus (most commonly a full bladder or bowel), and administering fast-acting antihypertensives if the hypertension persists.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect actions either worsen the condition (e.g., placing the client supine), fail to address the root cause, or delay critical treatment. The headache is a symptom of severe hypertension, not the primary problem, so treating it with analgesics without addressing the blood pressure is inappropriate and ineffective. Elevating the legs or placing the client supine will further increase cerebral blood pressure and the risk of a stroke.",
