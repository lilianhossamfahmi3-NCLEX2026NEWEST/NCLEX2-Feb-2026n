    "correct": "The client is exhibiting acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Tachypnea (RR 28/min), labored breathing with accessory muscle use, hypoxemia (SpO2 89% on 4L nasal cannula), and diffuse coarse crackles indicate severely impaired gas exchange. Applying NIPPV (e.g., BiPAP) is the priority. NIPPV delivers positive airway pressure, recruiting fluid-filled alveoli, improving oxygenation, decreasing the work of breathing, and reducing cardiac preload and afterload. This directly addresses the immediate life-threatening respiratory compromise. NIPPV increases intrathoracic pressure, which can improve left ventricular function by decreasing afterload. It also forces fluid back into the pulmonary capillaries, reducing pulmonary edema.",
    "incorrect": "While diuretics (furosemide) and vasodilators (nitroglycerin) are crucial in treating acute decompensated heart failure, they don't act rapidly enough to correct severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The client's airway and breathing are compromised, making respiratory support the immediate priority. Requesting a chest X-ray is a diagnostic measure; therapeutic action based on the clear clinical picture should not be delayed. Delaying treatment could lead to respiratory arrest.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. Furosemide is essential for fluid removal in heart failure, but its diuretic effect is not immediate enough to resolve critical hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Addressing respiratory failure takes precedence over fluid management.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Incorrect. A chest X-ray is diagnostic, not therapeutic. The client's presentation strongly suggests acute pulmonary edema, warranting immediate intervention. Delaying respiratory support for imaging is inappropriate and risks respiratory arrest.",

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. Labored breathing, accessory muscle use, diffuse crackles, and SpO2 of 89% on 4L oxygen indicate acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIPPV is the most appropriate initial action, immediately supporting ventilation, improving gas exchange by keeping alveoli open, and reducing the work of breathing, preventing progression to respiratory arrest.",
