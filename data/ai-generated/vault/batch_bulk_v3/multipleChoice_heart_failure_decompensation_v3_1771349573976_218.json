        "correct": "The client is exhibiting clear signs of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The combination of tachypnea (RR 28), labored breathing with accessory muscle use, hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) despite supplemental oxygen, and diffuse crackles indicates that the client's ability to maintain adequate gas exchange is rapidly failing. Applying NIPPV (such as BiPAP) is the priority intervention. It provides positive airway pressure to recruit fluid-filled alveoli, improve oxygenation, decrease the work of breathing, and reduce both cardiac preload and afterload, directly addressing the most immediate life-threatening condition.",
        "incorrect": "While administering diuretics (furosemide) and vasodilators (nitroglycerin) are key components of treating acute decompensated heart failure, they do not act as rapidly as NIPPV to correct severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The client's airway and breathing are compromised, making respiratory support the immediate priority over hemodynamic or fluid balance interventions. Requesting a chest X-ray is a diagnostic measure; therapeutic action based on the clear clinical picture should not be delayed.",

The most immediate life threat is respiratory failure, which must be addressed before managing fluid volume.",
