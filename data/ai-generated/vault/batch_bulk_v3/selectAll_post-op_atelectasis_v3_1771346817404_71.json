This action directly counteracts alveolar collapse (atelectasis), which is indicated by the client's diminished breath sounds and low oxygen saturation."

        "opt_2": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. The supine position can worsen atelectasis by allowing abdominal contents to press upward on the diaphragm, restricting full lung expansion. The client should be placed in an upright or semi-Fowler's position to facilitate diaphragmatic excursion and improve ventilation."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's pain rating of 6/10 and statement that it 'hurts too much to take a deep breath' indicate that pain is a primary contributor to shallow breathing (splinting). Providing adequate analgesia is critical to enable the client to breathe deeply, cough effectively, and mobilize, all of which are essential for treating atelectasis."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Splinting the abdominal incision with a pillow provides support and reduces pain during coughing and deep breathing exercises. This technique increases the client's ability and willingness to participate in pulmonary hygiene, which is necessary to clear secretions and re-expand collapsed lung tissue."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the client is anxious, a sedative can depress respiratory drive and level of consciousness. This would further inhibit the client's ability to take deep breaths and cooperate with interventions like incentive spirometry and ambulation, thereby worsening the atelectasis. The anxiety is likely secondary to dyspnea and should be addressed by treating the underlying respiratory issue."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Early and frequent ambulation is a key intervention to prevent and treat postoperative atelectasis. Mobilization increases respiratory rate and depth, promotes the mobilization of secretions from the airways, and improves overall lung function. Despite being post-op day 2, safe ambulation should be a priority."
