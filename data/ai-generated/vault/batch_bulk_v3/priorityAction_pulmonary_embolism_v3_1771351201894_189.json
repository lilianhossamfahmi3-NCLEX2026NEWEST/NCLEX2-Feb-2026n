    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client who is 3 days post-operative from a total knee arthroplasty. The client suddenly calls out and reports a sharp, stabbing pain in their chest and severe difficulty breathing. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following findings:\n\n**Vital Signs**\n* Heart Rate: 122/min\n* Respiratory Rate: 28/min\n* Blood Pressure: 94/62 mmHg\n* Oxygen Saturation: 88% on room air\n* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)\n\nThe nurse suspects a pulmonary embolism. Which action should the nurse take **first**?",
