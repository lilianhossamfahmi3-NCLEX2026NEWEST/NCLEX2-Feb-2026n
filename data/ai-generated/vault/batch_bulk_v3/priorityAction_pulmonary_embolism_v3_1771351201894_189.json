  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old client who is 3 days post-operative from a total knee arthroplasty. The client suddenly calls out and reports a sharp, stabbing pain in their chest and severe difficulty breathing. The nurse assesses the client and notes the following findings:\n\n**Vital Signs**\n* Heart Rate: 122/min\n* Respiratory Rate: 28/min\n* Blood Pressure: 94/62 mmHg\n* Oxygen Saturation: 88% on room air\n* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)\n\nThe nurse suspects a pulmonary embolism. Which action should the nurse take **first**?",

A PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and impaired gas exchange. The priority is to address the hypoxemia immediately. Administering high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen to the alveoli, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO2) and improving oxygen saturation. This supports vital organ function and prevents further deterioration due to oxygen deprivation. The underlying pathophysiology involves the obstruction of pulmonary arteries by a thrombus, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular strain. This can ultimately lead to right heart failure if not addressed promptly."

        "rationale": "Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position can improve chest expansion and ease breathing, but it does not directly address the critical hypoxemia. While helpful as a supportive measure, it is not the priority intervention. The primary issue is impaired gas exchange due to the PE, which requires immediate oxygen supplementation. The pathophysiology behind the dyspnea involves increased dead space ventilation and decreased alveolar ventilation due to the pulmonary obstruction. This leads to a higher respiratory rate as the body attempts to compensate for the decreased oxygen uptake."

        "rationale": "Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is essential in managing a PE to prevent further clot formation and propagation. However, it does not immediately improve the client's oxygenation status. Heparin's mechanism of action involves inhibiting thrombin and other clotting factors, preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. While crucial for long-term management, it is a secondary intervention after addressing the immediate threat to life. The ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) must be stabilized first. Delaying oxygen administration to prepare heparin could lead to irreversible organ damage due to hypoxia."

However, the nurse should initiate immediate interventions within their scope of practice before or simultaneously with calling the RRT. Delaying oxygen administration to call the RRT first could lead to rapid deterioration and cardiac arrest. The nurse can delegate the task of calling the RRT to another staff member while initiating oxygen therapy. Effective teamwork and communication are crucial in managing this medical emergency."

Obtain an ECG and prepare for blood gas analysis. Anticipate orders for anticoagulation therapy and further diagnostic testing (e.g., CT angiography)."
