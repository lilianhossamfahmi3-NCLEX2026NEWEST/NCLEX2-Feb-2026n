    "stem": "A 72-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is brought to the emergency department by his daughter. The daughter reports 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, a cough producing pink, frothy sputum, and significant leg swelling. The client is anxious, sitting upright in a tripod position, and states, 'I feel like I'm drowning.'\n\n**Assessment Findings:**\n*   **Vital Signs:** T 98.9°F (37.2°C), P 118/min (irregular), R 28/min (labored), BP 168/94 mmHg, SpO2 87% on room air.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** S1, S2, and S3 heart sounds noted. Jugular vein distention (JVD) present at a 45-degree angle.\n*   **Respiratory:** Bilateral crackles auscultated throughout all lung fields.\n*   **Extremities:** 3+ pitting edema noted bilaterally from the feet to the knees.\n*   **Labs:** B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is 2500 pg/mL.\n\nThe nurse analyzes the client's data. Which of the following findings are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)?",

                "rationale": "Correct. Pink, frothy sputum is a classic, ominous sign of severe pulmonary edema. The pink tinge is from capillary rupture in the lungs, and the frothy appearance is due to air mixing with the edematous fluid. This indicates a significant fluid shift into the alveoli."

                "optionId": "opt_04",
                "rationale": "Correct. An S3 heart sound, or 'ventricular gallop,' is a low-frequency sound heard in early diastole. It is caused by the rapid filling of a stiff, non-compliant ventricle and is a classic sign of volume overload and systolic heart failure."

While tachypnea can initially cause a mild respiratory alkalosis, severe ADHF with hypoxemia and poor tissue perfusion more commonly leads to metabolic or respiratory acidosis (a pH below 7.35) due to lactate accumulation and CO2 retention."
