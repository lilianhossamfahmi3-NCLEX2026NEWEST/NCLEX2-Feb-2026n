    "correct": "The client's presentation is consistent with Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a potentially life-threatening condition in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. The sudden, severe hypertension (210/112 mmHg), bradycardia (52/min), pounding headache, diaphoresis above the injury level, and piloerection below are classic signs. AD is triggered by a noxious stimulus below the level of the injury, which the client cannot perceive due to the spinal cord damage. This stimulus causes an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system response, leading to vasoconstriction and a rapid increase in blood pressure. The body attempts to compensate via the vagus nerve, resulting in bradycardia. \n\nThe priority nursing actions are to immediately reduce the blood pressure and identify/remove the triggering stimulus. Placing the client in high-Fowler's position (at-3) promotes orthostatic hypotension, aiding in blood pressure reduction. Assessing for bladder distention (at-5) is crucial, as bladder distention is the most common cause of AD. Catheterization may be necessary to relieve the pressure. Continuous blood pressure monitoring (pm-1) is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Monitoring urinary output (pm-3) after catheterization confirms the resolution of bladder distention and its impact on blood pressure. Failure to address AD can lead to stroke, seizure, or death.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections fail to recognize the specific pathophysiology and management of Autonomic Dysreflexia. Addressing only the symptom of hypertension or failing to identify and remove the noxious stimulus can have devastating consequences. \n\n*   **Incorrect Condition:** Misidentifying the condition leads to inappropriate interventions. While a hypertensive crisis is present, it's secondary to AD. Spinal shock presents with hypotension, not hypertension. Meningitis and sepsis have different clinical presentations.\n*   **Incorrect Actions:** Administering acetaminophen (at-1) only addresses the headache and does not treat the underlying cause. Lowering the head of the bed (at-2) will worsen the hypertension. Administering IV labetalol (at-4) may be necessary if other measures fail, but it's not the initial priority. \n*   **Incorrect Parameters:** Monitoring heart rate (pm-2), temperature (pm-4), or headache rating (pm-5) are less critical than monitoring blood pressure and urinary output in the acute management of AD.",
