A dull ache at the catheter insertion site is expected post-procedural pain, not myocardial ischemia. This confirms the primary problem (MI) is improving.

This indicates inadequate renal perfusion, potentially from cardiogenic shock (decreased cardiac output) or contrast-induced nephropathy. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Contrast-induced nephropathy is kidney damage caused by contrast dye used during the PCI procedure. Both are serious complications, indicating a worsening condition.",

Reperfused myocardial cells become electrically unstable. As long as they are not frequent (more than 6 per minute), sustained (runs of 3 or more), or multifocal (different shapes), they are considered an unchanged or expected finding. The underlying pathophysiology is related to electrolyte shifts and myocardial irritability.",

This suggests impaired arterial blood flow to the extremity, a potential vascular complication such as thrombosis or arterial occlusion at the insertion site.

While not ideal, it is an expected potential finding that doesn't signify systemic deterioration or acute crisis unless rapidly expanding or associated with hemodynamic instability. Therefore, it is classified as an unchanged/expected finding requiring monitoring. The hematoma is caused by bleeding from the arterial puncture site.",
