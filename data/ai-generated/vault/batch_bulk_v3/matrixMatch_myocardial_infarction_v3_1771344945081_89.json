Successful reperfusion is indicated by the resolution of ST-segment elevation and the cessation of ischemic chest pain. Post-procedure complications can be vascular (hematoma, limb ischemia), cardiac (arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock), or renal (contrast-induced nephropathy). Correctly classifying these findings demonstrates the ability to evaluate outcomes effectively.",

For example, confusing expected reperfusion arrhythmias (like occasional PVCs) with a worsening condition, or failing to recognize that oliguria and delayed capillary refill are critical signs of cardiogenic shock and vascular compromise, respectively. Also, mistaking expected access site pain for continued ischemic pain would be an incorrect evaluation.",
