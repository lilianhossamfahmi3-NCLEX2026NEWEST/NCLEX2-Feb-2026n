The client is dyspneic with bibasilar crackles, has 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and reports a 4.5 kg (10 lb) weight gain in the last 3 days.

        "correct": "The client is experiencing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) characterized by severe fluid volume overload (crackles, edema, weight gain) and respiratory distress (dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia). Essential interventions focus on reducing preload, improving oxygenation, and decreasing cardiac workload. This includes administering IV diuretics, placing the client in an upright position, and providing supplemental oxygen. Contraindicated actions are those that would worsen fluid overload or decrease cardiac output, such as administering IV fluids, oral fluids, or beta-blockers which are held during acute decompensation.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting Non-Essential for any of the essential or contraindicated actions indicates a misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of ADHF and priority interventions. Actions that would worsen the client's condition, such as administering fluids or beta-blockers, must be identified as contraindicated, not merely non-essential. Failing to identify essential actions like oxygen administration, positioning, and diuresis can lead to clinical deterioration.",
