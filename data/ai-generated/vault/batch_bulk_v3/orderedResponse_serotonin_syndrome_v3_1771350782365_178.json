The client also receives tramadol 50 mg every 6 hours as needed for chronic back pain, with the last dose administered two hours ago. During morning rounds, the nurse finds the client agitated, diaphoretic, and confused. The client's pupils are dilated, and they exhibit tremors and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities.",
