The client reports nausea and has vomited twice. The nurse reviews the initial assessment data and laboratory results. Which **five** findings would the nurse anticipate for a client with acute pancreatitis?",

It is caused by saponification, a process where calcium binds to free fatty acids in areas of fat necrosis, effectively removing calcium from the circulation. This can lead to tetany (e.g., positive Chvostek's or Trousseau's signs)."

This can lead to atelectasis, pneumonia, and pleural effusions, which are most common on the left side due to the anatomical proximity of the pancreatic tail to the left hemidiaphragm."

The systemic inflammatory response causes vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular space into the retroperitoneal space (third-spacing), resulting in hypovolemia and shock."
