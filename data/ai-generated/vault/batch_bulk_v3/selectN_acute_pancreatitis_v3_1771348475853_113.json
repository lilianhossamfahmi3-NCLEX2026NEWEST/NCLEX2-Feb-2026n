The client reports nausea and has vomited twice. The nurse reviews the initial assessment data and laboratory results. Which **five** findings would the nurse anticipate for a client with acute pancreatitis? Select all that apply.",

        "rationale": "**Correct (+):** Elevated serum lipase is a hallmark of acute pancreatitis. Damage to pancreatic acinar cells leads to the release of digestive enzymes, including lipase, into the bloodstream. Lipase is more specific to the pancreas than amylase and remains elevated for a longer period.  The normal range for lipase is typically 0-160 U/L, and in acute pancreatitis, it can be significantly elevated (3-10 times the upper limit of normal).  This elevation reflects the ongoing pancreatic inflammation and cellular damage. **Clinical Pearl:**  Always correlate lipase levels with the patient's clinical presentation and other diagnostic findings.",
        "pathophysiology": "Pancreatic inflammation causes acinar cell damage, releasing lipase into circulation."

While gallstones can be a cause of pancreatitis, the Murphy's sign directly assesses gallbladder inflammation. **Clinical Pearl:** Differentiate between cholecystitis and pancreatitis by assessing for specific signs and symptoms related to each condition.",

        "rationale": "**Correct (+):** Hypoactive bowel sounds are expected due to the inflammatory process irritating the bowel and potentially leading to a paralytic ileus. The inflammation and enzyme leakage into the peritoneal cavity can disrupt normal peristalsis. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor bowel sounds frequently in patients with acute pancreatitis to detect ileus early.  Early detection and management can prevent complications such as bowel obstruction.",

        "rationale": "**Incorrect (-):** Tachycardia, not bradycardia, is more commonly associated with acute pancreatitis. The systemic inflammatory response, pain, and potential hypovolemia trigger the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increased heart rate. Bradycardia is not a typical finding and may indicate other underlying issues. **Clinical Pearl:**  Tachycardia in acute pancreatitis is often a compensatory mechanism for hypovolemia and should be addressed with fluid resuscitation.",

        "rationale": "**Correct (+):** Hyperglycemia can occur due to damage to the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, which are responsible for insulin production. Inflammation can impair insulin secretion and/or increase glucagon release, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood glucose levels closely in patients with acute pancreatitis, as hyperglycemia can worsen the inflammatory process and increase the risk of complications. Insulin may be required to manage hyperglycemia.",

        "rationale": "**Correct (+):** Hypocalcemia is a common finding, especially in severe cases of acute pancreatitis. It results from saponification, a process where calcium binds to free fatty acids released during fat necrosis, effectively lowering the serum calcium level. This can lead to tetany. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of hypocalcemia, such as Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs. Severe hypocalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.",

        "rationale": "**Correct (+):** A left-sided pleural effusion can develop due to the proximity of the pancreatic tail to the left hemidiaphragm. Inflammation can extend to the diaphragm, causing irritation and fluid accumulation in the pleural space.  Additionally, lymphatic drainage from the pancreas primarily occurs on the left side. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess for signs of respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds, which may indicate a pleural effusion. Chest X-rays can confirm the presence of a pleural effusion.",

The systemic inflammatory response causes vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid shifts from the intravascular space into the retroperitoneal space (third-spacing). This results in hypovolemia and a drop in blood pressure. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor blood pressure closely and be prepared to administer intravenous fluids to maintain adequate perfusion.",
