        "correct": "The nurse should recognize the cluster of symptoms indicating serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. The key findings fall into three categories: altered mental status (agitation, confusion), autonomic hyperactivity (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular abnormalities (clonus, hyperreflexia). This client's recent increase in sertraline dose combined with the use of tramadol, another serotonergic agent, is a classic precipitating event. Identifying these specific cues is critical for prompt intervention.",
        "incorrect": "The nurse must differentiate between historical data/precipitating factors and current clinical findings, as well as between normal and abnormal assessment data. Highlighting normal findings (clear lungs, normoactive bowel sounds) or historical information (the medication change) demonstrates a failure to recognize the acute, clinically significant cues that define the current emergent condition.",
