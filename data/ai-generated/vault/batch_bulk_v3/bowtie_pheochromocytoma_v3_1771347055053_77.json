            "pc-1": "Incorrect. Malignant hypertension is a severe hypertensive state with evidence of acute end-organ damage. While the client has severe hypertension, this term describes the consequence rather than the underlying cause of the paroxysmal symptoms.",
            "pc-2": "Incorrect. Thyroid storm presents with tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis, but typically includes a high fever, gastrointestinal distress, and a history of thyroid disease. The episodic nature of the client's symptoms is less characteristic of a thyroid storm.",
            "pc-3": "Correct. The client's presentation includes the classic triad of symptoms for a pheochromocytoma: pounding headache, palpitations (tachycardia), and profuse sweating (diaphoresis), accompanied by severe, paroxysmal hypertension. This is the most likely underlying condition causing the crisis.",
            "pc-4": "Incorrect. Serotonin syndrome can cause autonomic instability, but it is typically associated with a recent change in serotonergic medication. The client's episodic, spell-like presentation is more specific to pheochromocytoma.",
            "pc-5": "Incorrect. While the client has a history of anxiety and appears anxious, the extreme level of hypertension (234/128 mmHg) is not typical for an anxiety attack alone and points to an underlying physiological cause."
        },
        "actionsToTake": {
            "at-1": "Correct. The priority is to control the severe hypertension. Phentolamine is a rapid-acting, non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker that is a primary treatment for hypertensive crises caused by pheochromocytoma, as it directly counteracts the effects of excessive catecholamines on blood vessels.",
            "at-2": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker like propranolol before establishing alpha-blockade is contraindicated. It can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing a paradoxical and life-threatening surge in blood pressure due to vasoconstriction.",
            "at-3": "Correct. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines in response to stimuli, including stress, anxiety, and noise. Placing the client in a calm, dark, and quiet environment helps to minimize these triggers and prevent further catecholamine release, aiding in blood pressure control.",
            "at-4": "Incorrect. While surgical removal (adrenalectomy) is the definitive treatment for pheochromocytoma, it is never performed emergently. The client must first be medically stabilized with alpha- and beta-blockers over a period of days to weeks to prevent intraoperative hemodynamic instability.",
            "at-5": "Incorrect. Physical activity, such as ambulation, can act as a trigger for catecholamine release from the tumor, which would exacerbate the hypertensive crisis. The client should be on strict bed rest."
        },
        "parametersToMonitor": {
            "pm-1": "Correct. Excessive catecholamines can cause severe tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect and manage these life-threatening dysrhythmias promptly.",
            "pm-2": "Correct. During a hypertensive crisis, blood pressure is extremely labile. Frequent, continuous, or every 5-15 minute blood pressure monitoring (ideally with an arterial line) is crucial to assess the client's response to antihypertensive therapy and titrate medications effectively.",
            "pm-3": "Incorrect. A 24-hour urine collection for VMA and metanephrines is a key diagnostic test to confirm pheochromocytoma, but it is not a parameter used to monitor the client's status during an acute crisis. The results are not available in real-time to guide immediate interventions.",
            "pm-4": "Correct. A blood pressure of 234/128 mmHg places the client at high risk for cerebrovascular complications, including hypertensive encephalopathy or hemorrhagic stroke. The nurse must frequently assess neurological status (e.g., level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor function) to detect any deterioration.",
            "pm-5": "Incorrect. Measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels would be appropriate if a thyroid storm was suspected. As pheochromocytoma is the most likely condition, these are not priority parameters for monitoring the acute crisis."
