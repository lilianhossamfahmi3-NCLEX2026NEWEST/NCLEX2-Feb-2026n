Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. Cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect dysrhythmias (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS) caused by hyperkalemia. Clinical Pearl: Untreated hyperkalemia can rapidly progress to ventricular fibrillation or asystole."

Hyponatremia (Na+ 128 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (Glucose 65 mg/dL) are also present. Rapid infusion of D5NS addresses these issues by restoring intravascular volume, increasing serum sodium, and correcting hypoglycemia. Clinical Pearl: Isotonic fluids like 0.9% NaCl are preferred initially in hypovolemic shock, but D5NS provides glucose, which is also deficient in Addisonian crisis."

Cortisol is essential for maintaining blood pressure, regulating glucose metabolism, and suppressing inflammation. IV administration ensures rapid absorption and action. Clinical Pearl: Addisonian crisis is a medical emergency requiring immediate glucocorticoid replacement to prevent circulatory collapse and death."

    "correct": "In an Addisonian crisis, the priority interventions address the life-threatening consequences of adrenal hormone deficiency: profound hypotension (shock), hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the nurse must immediately initiate rapid fluid resuscitation with a solution that corrects volume, sodium, and glucose deficits (D5NS). Intravenous hydrocortisone is the cornerstone of treatment, as it replaces the deficient cortisol, which is essential for vascular tone and glucose metabolism. Due to the life-threatening hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L), continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential fatal dysrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that could worsen the client's condition or are not immediate priorities should be avoided. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, would exacerbate the dangerous hyperkalemia. Administering insulin without sufficient dextrose would cause severe, potentially fatal hypoglycemia in a client who is already hypoglycemic. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a slow-acting treatment for hyperkalemia and is not a priority in this acute, hemodynamically unstable situation.",
