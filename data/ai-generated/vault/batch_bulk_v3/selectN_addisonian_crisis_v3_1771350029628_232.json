Therefore, the nurse must immediately initiate rapid fluid resuscitation with a solution that corrects volume, sodium, and glucose deficits (D5NS). Intravenous hydrocortisone is the cornerstone of treatment, as it replaces the deficient cortisol, which is essential for vascular tone and glucose metabolism. Due to the life-threatening hyperkalemia (5.9 mEq/L), continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential fatal dysrhythmias.",

Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, would exacerbate the dangerous hyperkalemia. Administering insulin without sufficient dextrose would cause severe, potentially fatal hypoglycemia in a client who is already hypoglycemic. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a slow-acting treatment for hyperkalemia and is not a priority in this acute, hemodynamically unstable situation.",
