    "rationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of central diabetes insipidus (DI) following a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. This condition arises due to insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys. The resulting polyuria causes hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and increased serum osmolality. The priority is to address the hemodynamic instability (hypotension) with fluid resuscitation, followed by administering desmopressin to replace the missing ADH. Subsequently, the nurse should communicate the critical change in status to the provider, ensure client safety, and then evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",

        "rationale": "The client's blood pressure is 88/56 mmHg and heart rate is 122 bpm, indicating significant hypovolemia and impending shock. According to Maslow's hierarchy and ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), restoring circulatory volume is the most immediate priority to prevent cardiovascular collapse. The provider's orders allow for titration to maintain SBP >90 mmHg. Increasing the rate of the hypotonic IV solution (0.45% NaCl) will both expand intravascular volume and help correct the severe hypernatremia (158 mEq/L). 0.45% NaCl is hypotonic, meaning it has a lower solute concentration than the blood. This causes fluid to shift from the intravascular space into the cells, rehydrating them. In DI, the body loses free water, leading to cellular dehydration. This intervention addresses both the hypovolemia and hypernatremia simultaneously."

        "rationale": "Immediately after addressing the life-threatening hypovolemia, the nurse must treat the underlying cause of the fluid loss. Administering desmopressin, a synthetic form of ADH, is the definitive treatment for central DI. This medication will bind to V2 receptors in the kidneys, increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts. This action decreases renal water excretion, concentrates the urine, and prevents further fluid loss and worsening of hypernatremia. The PRN order is indicated as the client's urine output has been excessive. This action must follow fluid resuscitation to stabilize the client while stopping the ongoing problem."

        "rationale": "After initiating immediate life-saving interventions that are within the nurse's scope based on existing orders, the next step is to communicate with the provider. The client's SBP is <90 mmHg and serum sodium is >150 mEq/L, both of which are specific triggers for notification in the provider's orders. This ensures the provider is aware of the client's decompensation and can provide further orders for management, such as further adjustments to IV fluids, electrolyte management, or further diagnostic testing to rule out other causes of polyuria."

        "rationale": "Ensuring client safety is a fundamental nursing responsibility. The client is hypotensive, restless, and likely experiencing polyuria and nocturia, which significantly increases the risk for falls, especially when getting up to use the restroom. Implementing fall precautions (e.g., bed in low position, call light in reach, bedside commode) is a crucial safety measure but is prioritized after the immediate life-threatening circulatory and endocrine issues are addressed. Hypotension can cause dizziness and lightheadedness, increasing the risk of falls. Polyuria and nocturia lead to frequent trips to the bathroom, further increasing the risk, especially in a post-operative patient."

        "rationale": "This is an evaluation step. After implementing interventions, the nurse must assess their effectiveness. Reassessing vital signs will determine if the fluid resuscitation has corrected the hypotension and tachycardia. Checking urine specific gravity (or urine output) will evaluate the response to desmopressin. An increase in urine specific gravity indicates that the kidneys are reabsorbing more water. This step is essential for ongoing management but logically occurs only after the interventions have been performed. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload is also important after administering fluids and desmopressin."
