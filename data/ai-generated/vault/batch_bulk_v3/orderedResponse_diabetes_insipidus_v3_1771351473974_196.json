Subsequently, the nurse should communicate the critical change in status to the provider, ensure client safety, and then evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",

According to Maslow's hierarchy and ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), restoring circulatory volume is the most immediate priority to prevent cardiovascular collapse. The provider's orders allow for titration to maintain SBP >90 mmHg. Increasing the rate of the hypotonic IV solution (0.45% NaCl) will both expand intravascular volume and help correct the severe hypernatremia (158 mEq/L)."

Administering desmopressin, a synthetic form of ADH, is the definitive treatment for central DI. This medication will decrease renal water excretion, concentrate the urine, and prevent further fluid loss and worsening of hypernatremia. The PRN order is indicated as the client's urine output has been excessive. This action must follow fluid resuscitation to stabilize the client while stopping the ongoing problem."

The client's SBP is <90 mmHg and serum sodium is >150 mEq/L, both of which are specific triggers for notification in the provider's orders. This ensures the provider is aware of the client's decompensation and can provide further orders for management."

The client is hypotensive, restless, and likely experiencing polyuria and nocturia, which significantly increases the risk for falls, especially when getting up to use the restroom. Implementing fall precautions (e.g., bed in low position, call light in reach, bedside commode) is a crucial safety measure but is prioritized after the immediate life-threatening circulatory and endocrine issues are addressed."

Reassessing vital signs will determine if the fluid resuscitation has corrected the hypotension and tachycardia. Checking urine specific gravity (or urine output) will evaluate the response to desmopressin. This step is essential for ongoing management but logically occurs only after the interventions have been performed."
