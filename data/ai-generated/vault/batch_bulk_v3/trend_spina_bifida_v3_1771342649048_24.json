These are hallmark signs of developing hydrocephalus, a common and serious complication of myelomeningocele repair. The closure of the spinal lesion can alter the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to its accumulation in the ventricles. This increases intracranial pressure (ICP), which manifests as a rapidly enlarging head and a bulging, tense fontanel in an infant whose skull sutures have not yet fused. This condition requires urgent intervention to prevent brain damage and herniation.",
        "incorrect": "While the other findings require monitoring, they do not indicate the same level of acute neurological compromise. A low-grade fever is common post-operatively and is not as specific as the signs of increased ICP. A small amount of serosanguinous drainage is an expected finding at a surgical site. The urine output, while slightly variable, remains within an acceptable range for an infant of this size and does not suggest acute renal failure or severe dehydration.",
