This is a medical emergency caused by an excess of serotonergic activity. The most critical, priority action is to identify and immediately discontinue all offending medications (sertraline, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan).

The combination of cognitive, autonomic, and neuromuscular symptoms after taking multiple serotonergic agents points directly to serotonin syndrome. The nurse must prioritize interventions based on addressing the underlying cause versus managing symptoms. While managing symptoms like hyperthermia and agitation is crucial, these efforts will be less effective and the client's condition will continue to deteriorate if the source of the excess serotonin is not eliminated.",

The hyperthermia is primarily generated by intense muscle activity; therefore, addressing the root cause (stopping the drugs) and controlling muscle activity (with benzodiazepines) is more definitive than external cooling alone."

This action removes the cause of the syndrome and is the most critical step to prevent further progression to seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse. All other interventions are supportive measures taken after this primary action."

                "explanation": "This action is not the immediate priority. While clients with severe serotonin syndrome may require intubation for airway protection or ventilatory support due to severe muscle rigidity, this client's current respiratory status (SpO2 95% on room air) does not indicate an immediate need for intubation. The nurse should anticipate this possibility but must first perform more urgent interventions."
