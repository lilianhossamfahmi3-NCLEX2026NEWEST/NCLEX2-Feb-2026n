Client reports a 'cloudy spot' in the vision of her right eye that started 3 days ago and has not resolved. States that for the past week, her right leg has felt 'heavy and clumsy,' causing her to trip twice yesterday. Reports feeling more tired than usual, especially in the afternoons. Client has a history of tingling in both feet, which she states is 'at its usual level'. Vital signs are T 37.1 C, P 82, R 16, BP 128/74. During the neurological assessment, the nurse notes nystagmus and dysarthria that were not present at her last neurology visit 3 months ago.",

        "correct": "A multiple sclerosis relapse (exacerbation) is characterized by the appearance of new neurological symptoms or the worsening of existing symptoms that lasts for at least 24 hours and is not caused by fever or infection (pseudo-relapse). The highlighted findings—new visual disturbances (optic neuritis), new motor weakness/ataxia, and new objective findings of nystagmus and dysarthria—all meet these criteria and strongly indicate a true MS relapse requiring intervention, typically with high-dose corticosteroids.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either chronic, stable symptoms, non-specific symptoms, or normal findings. Chronic paresthesia at its baseline is not a sign of a new relapse. While fatigue can worsen during a relapse, it is a very common and non-specific MS symptom and, by itself, is not a definitive indicator of a relapse. The client's vital signs are normal and, importantly, show no fever, which helps rule out a pseudo-relapse but is not a direct finding *of* a relapse.",
