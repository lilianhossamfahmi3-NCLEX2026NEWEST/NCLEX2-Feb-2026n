  "question": "A nurse on an inpatient psychiatric unit is caring for a 22-year-old male client with schizophrenia who was admitted for an acute exacerbation. During evening medication rounds, the nurse observes the client pacing rapidly in the hallway, shouting, \"The whispers are telling me the spies are closing in!\" The client is clenching and unclenching his fists and has refused his dinner, stating it is poisoned. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The client's behavior (pacing, shouting, clenching fists, paranoid delusions) indicates escalating agitation and potential aggression, requiring immediate intervention to ensure safety. The priority is de-escalation using the least restrictive measures. Moving the client to a quiet area reduces sensory overload, decreasing anxiety and agitation. Offering PRN antipsychotic medication addresses the underlying psychosis and helps calm the client. Maintaining a safe distance and using a calm, non-confrontational tone promotes trust and avoids escalating the situation. Discreetly signaling for staff backup ensures a coordinated response if the client's behavior escalates further. This approach aligns with the principles of crisis intervention in psychiatric settings, prioritizing safety and de-escalation.",
    "incorrect": "Confronting the client's delusions can increase anxiety and agitation, reinforcing the delusion as the client becomes defensive. Using a loud, firm voice can be perceived as threatening and escalate the client's fear and agitation. Restraints should only be used as a last resort when all other interventions have failed and there is an imminent risk of harm to self or others. These actions are contraindicated as they can worsen the client's condition and potentially lead to a dangerous situation.",
