    "question": "A nurse on an inpatient psychiatric unit is caring for a 22-year-old male client with schizophrenia who was admitted for an acute exacerbation. During evening medication rounds, the nurse observes the client pacing rapidly in the hallway, shouting, \"The whispers are telling me the spies are closing in!\" The client is clenching and unclenching his fists and has refused his dinner, stating it is poisoned. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting clear signs of escalating agitation, paranoid delusions, and potential for aggression (pacing, clenching fists). The priority is to ensure the safety of the client, other clients, and staff using the least restrictive interventions first. The correct approach involves a multi-faceted strategy: using therapeutic communication (calm tone, safe distance), reducing environmental stimuli (moving to a quiet area), offering medication to manage symptoms chemically, and preparing for further intervention by alerting other staff. This combination addresses the client's immediate distress while proactively managing safety risks.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options are contraindicated as they can escalate the client's agitation and paranoia. Confronting a fixed delusion is non-therapeutic and increases mistrust. Immediately resorting to restraints violates the principle of using the least restrictive intervention. Using a loud, authoritative voice can be perceived as threatening and will likely worsen the client's fear and agitation.",
