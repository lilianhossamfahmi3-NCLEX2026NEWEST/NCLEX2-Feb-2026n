    "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic triad of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES): respiratory distress (tachypnea, hypoxemia), neurological changes (restlessness, confusion), and a petechial rash following a long bone fracture. The most immediate life-threatening problem is severe hypoxemia (SpO2 88%), indicating a critical ventilation-perfusion mismatch. According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, addressing inadequate oxygenation is the highest priority. Applying a high-flow non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min will deliver the highest possible concentration of oxygen (FiO2 close to 100%) to correct hypoxemia, improve oxygen delivery to vital organs, and prevent progression to respiratory failure and potential cardiac arrest. FES occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream after a fracture. These globules travel to the lungs, causing inflammation, capillary damage, and impaired gas exchange.",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are appropriate, they do not take precedence over immediate oxygenation. Notifying the RRT/HCP is critical, but a direct, life-sustaining intervention like administering oxygen should be performed first or simultaneously if help is available. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position can help with lung expansion but is insufficient to correct the severe hypoxemia caused by the ventilation-perfusion mismatch in FES. Administering a sedative is contraindicated as the client's agitation is due to cerebral hypoxia, not anxiety; sedatives would depress the respiratory drive and mask further neurological decline. The petechiae are caused by fat emboli lodging in the capillaries, leading to rupture and pinpoint hemorrhages.",

      {
        "label": "Administer a prescribed PRN dose of lorazepam for agitation.",
        "content": "This action is incorrect and potentially harmful. The client's agitation and confusion are clinical manifestations of cerebral hypoxia due to fat emboli obstructing cerebral circulation. Administering a benzodiazepine would depress the central nervous system and respiratory drive, worsening the hypoxemia and masking crucial neurological changes. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential respiratory arrest. The underlying pathophysiology is the obstruction of cerebral blood vessels by fat emboli, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to the brain.",

While activating the RRT and notifying the HCP are essential and must be done immediately, a direct, life-saving intervention for the patient takes precedence. The nurse can initiate oxygen therapy in seconds while asking another staff member to make the call. The ABCs dictate that a breathing problem must be addressed first. Delaying oxygen administration to make a phone call could result in irreversible organ damage.",

Providing the highest concentration of oxygen possible is the priority intervention to improve tissue and brain perfusion and prevent irreversible organ damage or respiratory arrest. The non-rebreather mask provides a high concentration of oxygen, helping to overcome the ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by the fat emboli in the pulmonary capillaries.",

Although placing the client in an upright position can facilitate chest expansion and ease the work of breathing, it is not the most critical intervention.

High-flow oxygen is the definitive initial step. While helpful, positioning is secondary to addressing the critical hypoxemia.",
