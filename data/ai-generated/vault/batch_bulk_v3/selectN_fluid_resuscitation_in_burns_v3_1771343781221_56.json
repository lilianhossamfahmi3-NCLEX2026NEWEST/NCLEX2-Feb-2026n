    "correct": "The client's clinical presentation of tachycardia (128/min), hypotension (92/60 mmHg), and oliguria (25 mL/hr) indicates inadequate fluid resuscitation and progression of burn shock, despite the initial IV rate being calculated correctly. The primary goal is to restore intravascular volume and maintain end-organ perfusion. Therefore, the nurse must increase the fluid rate, implement safety measures for potential complications like hyperkalemia (cardiac monitoring), and collaborate with the provider to optimize the treatment plan. Burn shock occurs due to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, leading to hypovolemia and decreased cardiac output. The inflammatory response triggered by the burn injury increases capillary permeability, exacerbating fluid loss.",
