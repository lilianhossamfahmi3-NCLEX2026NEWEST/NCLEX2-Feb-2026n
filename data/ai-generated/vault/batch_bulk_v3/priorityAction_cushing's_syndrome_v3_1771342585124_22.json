    "correct": "The client's severe hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L) and irregular heart rhythm pose the greatest immediate threat. Hypokalemia increases myocardial excitability, potentially leading to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Addressing the potassium deficit is paramount to stabilize cardiac function. The 'Circulation' component of the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) guides this prioritization.",
    "incorrect": "While hyperglycemia, hypertension, and potential infection require prompt attention, the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmia due to hypokalemia takes precedence. Administering insulin before correcting potassium would worsen hypokalemia. The infection and hypertension, while serious, do not pose the same immediate threat to life.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. While hyperglycemia is present, administering insulin *before* addressing the hypokalemia can worsen the potassium deficit, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Insulin promotes intracellular potassium shift, further depleting serum potassium.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Correct. A potassium level of 2.9 mEq/L is critically low and likely contributes to the irregular heart rhythm. This places the client at high risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias. Correcting the hypokalemia is crucial for stabilizing the cardiovascular system and preventing cardiac arrest.",

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Incorrect. While fever, crackles, and elevated WBC suggest infection (possibly pneumonia, common in immunosuppressed Cushing's clients), addressing the immediate cardiac risk from hypokalemia is the priority. Antibiotics are essential but secondary to stabilizing the heart.",

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Incorrect. Hypertension (178/98 mmHg) is a concern in Cushing's syndrome and requires treatment.

      "recommendation": "Initiate intravenous potassium chloride infusion immediately. Monitor cardiac rhythm continuously. Reassess potassium levels frequently. Consider telemetry monitoring. After potassium repletion begins, address hyperglycemia with insulin per sliding scale. Obtain cultures and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics after consulting with the provider. Address hypertension after stabilizing potassium and glucose."
