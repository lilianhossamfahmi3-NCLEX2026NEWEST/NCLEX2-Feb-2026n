        "correct": "The client's severe hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L) in conjunction with an irregular heart rhythm on the cardiac monitor represents the most immediate life-threatening condition. Hypokalemia increases myocardial irritability and can lead to fatal dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, stabilizing the client's cardiac status by initiating a potassium infusion is the highest priority action based on the 'Circulation' component of the ABCs.",
        "incorrect": "While the client has severe hyperglycemia, severe hypertension, and signs of infection that all require urgent treatment, the risk of a fatal cardiac event from hypokalemia takes precedence. Administering insulin before correcting potassium would worsen the hypokalemia. The infection and hypertension, while serious, do not pose the same instantaneous threat as the cardiac arrhythmia.",

While the client's blood glucose is critically high, administering insulin will cause an intracellular shift of potassium, further lowering the serum potassium level. This would exacerbate the existing severe hypokalemia and significantly increase the risk of a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. Potassium must be repleted before insulin is administered.",
