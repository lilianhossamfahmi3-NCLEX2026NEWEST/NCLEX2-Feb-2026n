Applying cooling measures is important but secondary to controlling the neuromuscular hyperactivity causing the hyperthermia. Administering acetaminophen is ineffective as the fever is not centrally mediated. Tapering or holding a single dose of the causative agents is insufficient and dangerous. Using medications like dantrolene or bromocriptine is incorrect as they are used for neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
