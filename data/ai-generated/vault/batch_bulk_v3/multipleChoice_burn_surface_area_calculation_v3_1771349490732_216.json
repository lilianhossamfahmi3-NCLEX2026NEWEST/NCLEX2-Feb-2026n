    "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 45-year-old client rescued from a house fire. The nurse's assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk, partial-thickness burns enveloping the entire left arm, and deep partial-thickness burns on the anterior aspect of the right leg. Using the Rule of Nines, what is the estimated Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) percentage of the burn?",
