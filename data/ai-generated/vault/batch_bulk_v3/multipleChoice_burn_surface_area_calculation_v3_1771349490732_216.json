        "correct": "The correct calculation using the Rule of Nines for an adult is 36%. The anterior trunk accounts for 18%, the entire left arm is 9%, and the anterior aspect of a single leg is 9%. The sum of these areas (18% + 9% + 9%) equals 36%.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Burns cause significant damage to the skin, disrupting its protective barrier. This leads to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space due to increased capillary permeability and osmotic pressure changes. Accurate TBSA calculation is a critical first step for determining the volume of intravenous fluid resuscitation required to prevent hypovolemic shock in a major burn injury. Under-resuscitation can lead to organ failure, while over-resuscitation can cause pulmonary edema and compartment syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always double-check your TBSA calculation, especially in high-stress situations. Use a burn diagram to visually confirm the affected areas.\n\n**Question Trap:** Students may miscalculate by including the entire leg instead of just the anterior portion or by forgetting to include one of the burned areas.\n\n**Mnemonic:** Remember the Rule of Nines: Anterior Trunk (18%), Entire Left Arm (9%), Anterior Right Leg (9%).",

Vital signs: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on 100% FiO2 via non-rebreather mask. The client is alert but anxious, reporting pain level of 7/10. Urine output not yet assessed.",

This equates to 10080 mL over 24 hours, with half given in the first 8 hours. Monitor urine output hourly, aiming for 30-50 mL/hr, and adjust fluids accordingly. Administer pain medication as prescribed. Consider early intubation if respiratory status deteriorates. Consult the burn specialist."
