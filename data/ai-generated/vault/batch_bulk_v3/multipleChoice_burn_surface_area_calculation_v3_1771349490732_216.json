  "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 45-year-old client rescued from a house fire. The nurse's assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk, partial-thickness burns enveloping the entire left arm, and deep partial-thickness burns on the anterior aspect of the right leg. Using the Rule of Nines, what is the estimated Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) percentage of the burn?",

    "correct": "The correct calculation using the Rule of Nines for an adult is 36%. The anterior trunk accounts for 18%, the entire left arm is 9%, and the anterior aspect of a single leg is 9%. The sum of these areas (18% + 9% + 9%) equals 36%.  \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Burns cause significant damage to the skin, disrupting its protective barrier. This leads to massive fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space due to increased capillary permeability and osmotic pressure changes.  Accurate TBSA calculation is a critical first step for determining the volume of intravenous fluid resuscitation required to prevent hypovolemic shock in a major burn injury. Under-resuscitation can lead to organ failure, while over-resuscitation can cause pulmonary edema and compartment syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always double-check your TBSA calculation, especially in high-stress situations. Use a burn diagram to visually confirm the affected areas.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect calculations of TBSA can lead to either under-resuscitation, causing inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure, or over-resuscitation, leading to fluid overload, compartment syndrome, and pulmonary edema.
