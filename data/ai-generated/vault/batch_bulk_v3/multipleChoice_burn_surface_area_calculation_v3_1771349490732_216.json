The client has a known history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. His pre-burn weight is estimated at 70 kg. He lives alone in a low-income apartment building and reports significant financial stress, which may present a barrier to accessing long-term wound care and rehabilitation services after discharge.\n\nASSESSMENT: At 14:15, the physical exam reveals extensive burns. Vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, indicative of early burn shock. There are no immediate signs of airway compromise, such as stridor or soot in the nares, but the client is tachypneic.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I recommend immediate placement of two large-bore IVs and initiation of aggressive fluid resuscitation per the Parkland formula. Administer IV opioids for pain control. Obtain STAT labs, including a carboxyhemoglobin level. Consult the regional burn center for emergent transfer.",
