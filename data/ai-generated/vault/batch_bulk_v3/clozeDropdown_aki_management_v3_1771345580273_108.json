Despite receiving a potent loop diuretic, the client's urine output remains oliguric (10 mL/hr), and signs of fluid volume excess have intensified, as shown by the CVP increasing from 18 to 20 mmHg and worsening crackles. The renal function has also deteriorated, evidenced by the rise in creatinine, BUN, and the development of life-threatening hyperkalemia (6.1 mEq/L). This clinical picture indicates diuretic resistance and progression of AKI. The priority action is to anticipate the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), as medical management has failed and the client has life-threatening complications.",
        "incorrect": "The client is not improving or remaining unchanged; multiple data points show active deterioration. Focusing on a single parameter like urine output or creatinine alone would be an incomplete assessment. Further medical management with diuretics is futile and dangerous given the diuretic resistance and hyperkalemia. Simply monitoring is a passive action that fails to address the client's critical state.",
