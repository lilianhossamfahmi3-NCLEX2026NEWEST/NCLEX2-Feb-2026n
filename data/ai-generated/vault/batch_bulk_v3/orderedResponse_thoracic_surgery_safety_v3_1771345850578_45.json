    "gender": "Male",
    "setting": "Medical-Surgical Unit",
    "background": "The client is 2 days postoperative following a right lower lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. He has a Pleur-evac chest drainage system connected to a single chest tube in the right pleural space."
  },
  "scenario": "The nurse is assisting the client to ambulate back to bed. As the client sits on the edge of the bed, the chest tube tubing accidentally disconnects from the connector of the drainage system, and the end of the chest tube falls to the floor. The nurse immediately clamps the chest tube with padded clamps kept at the bedside.",
  "stem": "After briefly clamping the tube, the nurse determines the drainage system needs to be replaced. Using SBAR format, prioritize the following nursing actions in the correct order, from first to last. Drag the actions into the correct sequence.",

        "rationale": "**First:** Placing the distal end of the chest tube into a bottle of sterile water creates a water seal. This is the priority action to prevent air from entering the pleural space, which could lead to a tension pneumothorax. The water acts as a one-way valve, allowing air to escape from the pleural space but preventing air from re-entering. This action immediately addresses the most life-threatening potential complication. **Clinical Pearl:** Keep a bottle of sterile water at the bedside of all patients with chest tubes.",

        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "**Second:** Assessing the client for signs of respiratory distress and checking oxygen saturation is crucial to determine if the client has been compromised by the disconnection. Signs of respiratory distress include dyspnea, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, and decreased oxygen saturation. This assessment guides further interventions. **Pathophysiology:** Disconnection of the chest tube can lead to air entering the pleural space, collapsing the lung (pneumothorax). A tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, causing increased pressure in the chest, shifting mediastinal structures, and compromising cardiac output. **Clinical Pearl:** Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is essential after any chest tube manipulation.",

        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "**Third:** Obtaining a new sterile drainage system and preparing connection sites with antiseptic is necessary to re-establish a closed and sterile system. Using antiseptic (e.g., chlorhexidine) minimizes the risk of infection. **Pathophysiology:** The pleural space is normally sterile. Introducing bacteria can lead to empyema (pus in the pleural space), a serious complication requiring antibiotics and potentially further drainage procedures. **Clinical Pearl:** Maintain strict aseptic technique when handling chest tubes and drainage systems.",

        "rationale": "**Fourth:** Reconnecting the chest tube to the new drainage system and unclamping the tube restores the closed system and allows for continued drainage of air and fluid from the pleural space. The clamp is removed to allow the lung to re-expand. **Pathophysiology:** Clamping the chest tube for prolonged periods can lead to a tension pneumothorax if air continues to leak into the pleural space. Unclamping allows the air to escape into the drainage system. **Clinical Pearl:** Only clamp chest tubes briefly and according to physician orders.",

        "rationale": "**Fifth:** Securing the new connection with waterproof tape ensures that the system remains airtight and prevents accidental disconnections. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the closed drainage system. **Clinical Pearl:** Use a secure taping method, such as a spiral wrap, to ensure a tight seal.",

The surgeon may order a chest x-ray to assess lung re-expansion and rule out a pneumothorax. **Clinical Pearl:** Prompt communication with the healthcare provider is crucial for optimal patient care.",
