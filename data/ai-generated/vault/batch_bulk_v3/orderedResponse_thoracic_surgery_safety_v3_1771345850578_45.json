        "setting": "Medical-Surgical Unit",
        "background": "The client is 2 days postoperative following a right lower lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. He has a Pleur-evac chest drainage system connected to a single chest tube in the right pleural space."
    },
    "scenario": "The nurse is assisting the client to ambulate back to bed. As the client sits on the edge of the bed, the chest tube tubing accidentally disconnects from the connector of the drainage system, and the end of the chest tube falls to the floor. The nurse immediately clamps the chest tube with padded clamps kept at the bedside.",
    "stem": "After briefly clamping the tube, the nurse determines the drainage system needs to be replaced. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag the actions into the correct sequence, from first to last.",

                "rationale": "The first and most critical action is to re-establish a water seal to prevent air from entering the pleural space, which could cause a tension pneumothorax. Submerging the end of the chest tube in 2 cm of sterile water creates a temporary one-way valve, allowing air to escape from the client's chest but not to enter. This immediately mitigates the most life-threatening risk."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "rationale": "Immediately after stabilizing the airway by creating a temporary water seal, the nurse must assess the client's respiratory status. This assessment determines if the client has been compromised by the disconnection (e.g., development of a pneumothorax). Findings such as tachypnea, hypoxia, or tracheal deviation would indicate significant respiratory distress requiring more urgent intervention."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Once the client is confirmed to be stable, the nurse prepares to definitively fix the problem. This involves gathering a new, sterile drainage system and using an antiseptic, such as alcohol or povidone-iodine, to clean the end of the chest tube and the new connector. This step is crucial for preventing the introduction of microorganisms from the contaminated tube into the sterile pleural space."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "After preparing the equipment and ensuring aseptic technique, the nurse reconnects the chest tube to the new drainage system. The clamp, which was only used briefly and emergently, must be removed immediately after reconnection to allow for drainage and re-establishment of negative pressure, preventing a tension pneumothorax from trapped air."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "After the system is reconnected, the connection point must be secured to prevent a recurrence of the disconnection. Using waterproof tape, often in a spiral or zipper fashion, creates a more secure seal and connection between the chest tube and the drainage tubing."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "rationale": "The final step, after the client is stable and the system is secured, is to notify the healthcare provider (in this case, the thoracic surgeon). The provider must be informed about the break in the sterile system. They may order a stat chest x-ray to rule out a pneumothorax and may provide further instructions for monitoring."
