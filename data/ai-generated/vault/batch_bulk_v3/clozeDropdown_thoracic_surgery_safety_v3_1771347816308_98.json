  "itemStem": "The nurse is caring for a 65-year-old client who is 6 hours post-right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. The client has a chest tube connected to a water seal drainage system. During the hourly assessment, the nurse notes the chest tube has drained 300 mL of bright red blood in the last hour. The client's heart rate is now 122/min, blood pressure is 94/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 28/min with an SpO2 of 91% on 4L nasal cannula.",

This aligns with the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework.",
        "rationale": "Hypoxemia triggers compensatory mechanisms like increased respiratory rate and heart rate. Providing supplemental oxygen addresses the underlying oxygen deficit, preventing further cellular hypoxia and potential organ damage. The goal is to increase SpO2 to the prescribed target range, typically >92%."

        "rationale": "Clamping the chest tube can lead to a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural space, compressing the lung and mediastinum. This impairs venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiovascular collapse. It does not address the underlying cause of the bleeding."

The priority is to optimize oxygenation and ventilation, which is best achieved with the head of the bed elevated to at least 30 degrees, unless contraindicated."

The surgeon needs to be notified immediately to assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.",
