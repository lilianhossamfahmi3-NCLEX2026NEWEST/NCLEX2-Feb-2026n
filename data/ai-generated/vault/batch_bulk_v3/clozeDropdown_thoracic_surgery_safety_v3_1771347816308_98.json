            "opt_01": "Correct. The client is showing signs of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (RR 28/min, SpO2 91%). According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, addressing the client's oxygenation status is the immediate priority to prevent further deterioration.",
            "opt_02": "Incorrect. Clamping the chest tube is contraindicated and dangerous. It would prevent blood and air from escaping the pleural space, potentially leading to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. It does not address the source of the internal bleeding.",
            "opt_03": "Incorrect. Lowering the head of the bed (Trendelenburg position) is sometimes used for profound hypotension but is not the first action here. It can increase the work of breathing and worsen the client's respiratory distress. The priority is to address oxygenation first.",
            "opt_04": "Incorrect. The client's clinical presentation with tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and significant bleeding is indicative of hemorrhagic shock, not primarily pain. While pain management is important post-operatively, it is not the priority in this life-threatening situation."
        },
        "blank2": {
            "opt_05": "Incorrect. Documentation is a necessary part of nursing care, but it should never delay reporting critical, life-threatening changes to the provider. This is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention.",
            "opt_06": "Correct. After stabilizing the client's immediate oxygenation, the nurse must immediately notify the surgeon. A drainage of >100-200 mL/hr of bright red blood, coupled with signs of hemodynamic instability, indicates active postoperative hemorrhage, which is a surgical emergency requiring urgent medical/surgical intervention.",
            "opt_07": "Incorrect. While a chest x-ray will likely be ordered by the surgeon, the nurse's priority is to communicate the critical assessment findings. Delaying notification to obtain an x-ray is inappropriate and wastes critical time.",
            "opt_08": "Incorrect. Checking for kinks or clots is appropriate when drainage has suddenly stopped or decreased. In this scenario, the problem is excessive drainage, indicating active bleeding, not an obstruction."
        },
        "blank3": {
            "opt_09": "Incorrect. While a blood transfusion is a highly anticipated supportive treatment to replace lost blood volume and address hemorrhagic shock, it is not the definitive intervention. The definitive action is to surgically stop the source of the bleeding.",
            "opt_10": "Incorrect. Inserting a second chest tube would only provide another outlet for the bleeding; it would not address or stop the source of the hemorrhage inside the thoracic cavity.",
            "opt_11": "Correct. The definitive treatment for uncontrolled postoperative thoracic hemorrhage is an emergency thoracotomy. The nurse should anticipate and prepare for the client's immediate return to the operating room to locate and control the source of bleeding.",
            "opt_12": "Incorrect. Protamine sulfate is a heparin antagonist. There is no information in the scenario to suggest the client is bleeding due to heparin anticoagulation. The most likely cause is a surgical bleed, making this medication irrelevant and inappropriate to anticipate as the primary intervention."
