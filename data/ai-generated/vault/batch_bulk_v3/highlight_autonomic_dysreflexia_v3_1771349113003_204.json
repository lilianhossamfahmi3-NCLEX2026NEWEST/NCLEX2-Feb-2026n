Vital signs are: [blood pressure 198/104 mmHg], [heart rate 48/min], respirations 18/min, and SpO2 98% on room air. Assessment reveals [flushing and diaphoresis on the face and neck], above the level of injury. The client is also [complaining of a stuffy nose]. His skin is cool and pale below the nipple line.

        "correct": "The selected findings are the classic signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency. The combination of a sudden, severe pounding headache, extreme hypertension (198/104 mmHg), and reflex bradycardia (48/min) are hallmark indicators. The flushing and diaphoresis above the level of injury (T4), along with nasal congestion, are caused by massive vasodilation above the injury level as the body attempts to compensate for the severe hypertension. Recognizing this cluster of cues is critical for initiating immediate interventions, such as sitting the client upright and identifying and removing the noxious stimulus.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either demographic data, historical information, or potential causes rather than direct signs of the AD episode itself. While the history of a T4 injury is the reason the client is at risk, it is not a current cue of the acute event. Similarly, the report of the last bowel movement is a clue to a potential trigger (fecal impaction) but is not a direct manifestation of the AD crisis. The demographic data is irrelevant to the acute clinical picture.",
