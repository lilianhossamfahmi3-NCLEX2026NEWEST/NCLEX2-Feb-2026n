Vital signs are: [blood pressure 198/104 mmHg], [heart rate 48/min], respirations 18/min, and SpO2 98% on room air. Assessment reveals [flushing and diaphoresis on the face and neck], above the level of injury. The client is also [complaining of a stuffy nose]. His skin is cool and pale below the nipple line. The indwelling urinary catheter is draining clear yellow urine and the tubing is free of kinks. The client reports his [last bowel movement was two days ago].",

    "correct": "The highlighted findings are indicative of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency unique to individuals with spinal cord injuries, particularly above T6. AD is triggered by noxious stimuli below the level of injury, leading to an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response. This results in severe hypertension (BP 198/104 mmHg), which the body attempts to compensate for via the vagus nerve, causing reflex bradycardia (HR 48/min). The pounding headache is due to cerebral vasodilation from the elevated blood pressure. Flushing and diaphoresis above the injury level (T4) occur as the body tries to lower blood pressure through vasodilation in the unaffected areas. Nasal congestion is also a result of vasodilation in the nasal mucosa. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent stroke, seizure, or even death.",
    "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either demographic information, historical context, or potential triggers, but not direct manifestations of the acute AD episode. While the T4 spinal cord injury explains the *risk* for AD, it's not a symptom of the current crisis. Similarly, the last bowel movement being two days ago suggests a possible trigger (fecal impaction), but it's not a direct sign of AD. The client's age and gender are irrelevant to the acute clinical presentation.",
