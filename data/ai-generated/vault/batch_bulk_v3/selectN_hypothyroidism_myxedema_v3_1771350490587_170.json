    "Encourage oral fluids to correct dehydration.",

  "answerBreakdown": {
    "Administer prescribed intravenous levothyroxine.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency resulting from severe hypothyroidism. The pathophysiology involves a profound decrease in thyroid hormone production, leading to a significant reduction in metabolic rate and impaired cellular function. Immediate IV levothyroxine is crucial to rapidly increase thyroid hormone levels, restoring metabolic function and preventing further deterioration. The IV route bypasses the impaired GI absorption common in myxedema coma.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Levothyroxine should be administered IV in myxedema coma due to impaired GI absorption. Monitor for signs of hyperthyroidism as thyroid hormone levels increase."
    },
    "Apply an external warming blanket to rapidly correct hypothermia.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Rapid rewarming with external warming blankets can cause peripheral vasodilation. This leads to a sudden decrease in blood pressure and can precipitate cardiovascular collapse in a client with already compromised cardiovascular function due to severe hypothyroidism. The pathophysiology involves the shunting of blood to the periphery, reducing blood flow to vital organs.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid rapid rewarming in myxedema coma. It can lead to dangerous hemodynamic instability."
    },
    "Initiate passive rewarming using warm blankets.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Passive rewarming involves using warm blankets and increasing the ambient room temperature to gradually increase the client's core body temperature. This method avoids the rapid vasodilation and hemodynamic instability associated with active rewarming. The pathophysiology involves minimizing stress on the cardiovascular system while slowly restoring normal body temperature.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Passive rewarming is the preferred method for hypothermia in myxedema coma to prevent cardiovascular complications."
    },
    "Administer a prescribed sedative to prevent shivering.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Clients with myxedema coma have a significantly decreased metabolic rate and are extremely sensitive to central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including sedatives and opioids. The pathophysiology involves reduced drug metabolism and clearance, leading to prolonged and exaggerated effects. Administering these medications can precipitate or worsen respiratory failure and profound sedation due to the already compromised respiratory drive.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid sedatives and opioids in myxedema coma due to increased sensitivity and risk of respiratory depression."
    },
    "Implement aspiration precautions.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The client is obtunded, indicating a severely altered level of consciousness. This impairs protective reflexes such as gag and cough, increasing the risk of aspiration of oral secretions or gastric contents. The pathophysiology involves reduced neurological function and impaired muscle coordination. Aspiration precautions, such as elevating the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees and maintaining NPO status, are essential to prevent aspiration pneumonia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Aspiration precautions are critical in myxedema coma due to the altered level of consciousness and impaired reflexes."
    },
    "Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Severe, long-standing hypothyroidism can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, administering thyroid hormone replacement increases metabolism and cortisol clearance, which can precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in a client with low adrenal reserves. The pathophysiology involves impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Monitoring for hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia is critical, and empirical glucocorticoid therapy (e.g., hydrocortisone) is often administered concurrently to prevent adrenal crisis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor for adrenal insufficiency and consider empirical glucocorticoid therapy when treating myxedema coma."
    },
    "Encourage oral fluids to correct dehydration.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Due to the client's obtunded state and high risk for aspiration, oral intake of any kind is contraindicated. Furthermore, myxedema coma is often associated with hyponatremia due to impaired free water excretion. The pathophysiology involves decreased renal function and impaired ADH regulation. Fluid replacement, if needed, must be administered intravenously and with extreme caution to avoid fluid overload and worsening hyponatremia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid oral fluids in myxedema coma due to aspiration risk and potential for hyponatremia. Administer IV fluids cautiously."

    "situation": "At 1400, a 78-year-old client with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of myxedema coma.",
    "background": "The client is obtunded with a heart rate of 42/min, blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8/min, and a temperature of 34.1°C (93.4°F). The client's medications were not taken at home for the last 2 weeks.",
    "assessment": "The nurse is developing the immediate plan of care. The client is showing signs of hypoventilation and decreased cardiac output.",
    "recommendation": "Which nursing interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply."

  "rationales": {
    "Administer prescribed intravenous levothyroxine.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency caused by severe hypothyroidism. The cornerstone of treatment is immediate thyroid hormone replacement. The intravenous route is necessary because severe hypothyroidism causes decreased gastrointestinal motility and absorption, making oral administration unreliable and ineffective in this critical state."
    },
    "Apply an external warming blanket to rapidly correct hypothermia.": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Active, rapid rewarming with devices like warming blankets is contraindicated. It can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse in a patient who is already hemodynamically unstable."
    },
    "Initiate passive rewarming using warm blankets.": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Passive rewarming, which involves covering the client with warm blankets and increasing the ambient room temperature, is the standard of care. This method gradually and safely increases the core body temperature without causing the dangerous hemodynamic shifts associated with active rewarming."

      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "The client is obtunded, indicating a severely altered level of consciousness. This significantly impairs the protective gag and cough reflexes, placing the client at a very high risk for aspiration of oral secretions or gastric contents. Aspiration precautions, such as elevating the head of the bed and maintaining NPO status, are essential."

      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Severe, long-standing hypothyroidism can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, administering thyroid hormone replacement increases metabolism and cortisol clearance, which can precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in a client with low adrenal reserves. Therefore, close monitoring for hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia is critical, and empirical glucocorticoid therapy is often administered concurrently."
