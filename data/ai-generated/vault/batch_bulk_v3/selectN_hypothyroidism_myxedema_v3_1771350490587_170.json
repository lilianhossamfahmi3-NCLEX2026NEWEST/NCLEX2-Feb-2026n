    "question": "A 78-year-old client with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of myxedema coma. The client is obtunded with a heart rate of 42/min, blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8/min, and a temperature of 34.1°C (93.4°F). The nurse is developing the immediate plan of care. Which nursing interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",
    "options": [
        "Administer a prescribed sedative to prevent shivering.",
        "Implement aspiration precautions.",
        "Encourage oral fluids to correct dehydration.",
        "Apply an external warming blanket to rapidly correct hypothermia.",
        "Administer prescribed intravenous levothyroxine.",
        "Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency.",
        "Initiate passive rewarming using warm blankets."
    ],
    "correct": [
        "Administer prescribed intravenous levothyroxine.",
        "Initiate passive rewarming using warm blankets.",
        "Implement aspiration precautions.",
        "Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency."
    ],
    "answerBreakdown": {
        "Administer prescribed intravenous levothyroxine.": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency caused by severe hypothyroidism. The cornerstone of treatment is immediate thyroid hormone replacement. The intravenous route is necessary because severe hypothyroidism causes decreased gastrointestinal motility and absorption, making oral administration unreliable and ineffective in this critical state."
        },
        "Apply an external warming blanket to rapidly correct hypothermia.": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Active, rapid rewarming with devices like warming blankets is contraindicated. It can cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and cardiovascular collapse in a patient who is already hemodynamically unstable."
        },
        "Initiate passive rewarming using warm blankets.": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Passive rewarming, which involves covering the client with warm blankets and increasing the ambient room temperature, is the standard of care. This method gradually and safely increases the core body temperature without causing the dangerous hemodynamic shifts associated with active rewarming."
        },
        "Administer a prescribed sedative to prevent shivering.": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Clients with myxedema coma have a significantly decreased metabolic rate and are extremely sensitive to central nervous system depressants, including sedatives and opioids. Administering these medications can precipitate or worsen respiratory failure and profound sedation."
        },
        "Implement aspiration precautions.": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "The client is obtunded, indicating a severely altered level of consciousness. This significantly impairs the protective gag and cough reflexes, placing the client at a very high risk for aspiration of oral secretions or gastric contents. Aspiration precautions, such as elevating the head of the bed and maintaining NPO status, are essential."
        },
        "Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency.": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Severe, long-standing hypothyroidism can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, administering thyroid hormone replacement increases metabolism and cortisol clearance, which can precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in a client with low adrenal reserves. Therefore, close monitoring for hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia is critical, and empirical glucocorticoid therapy is often administered concurrently."
        },
        "Encourage oral fluids to correct dehydration.": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Due to the client's obtunded state and high risk for aspiration, oral intake of any kind is contraindicated. Furthermore, myxedema coma is often associated with hyponatremia due to impaired free water excretion. Fluid replacement, if needed, must be administered intravenously and with extreme caution to avoid fluid overload and worsening hyponatremia."
