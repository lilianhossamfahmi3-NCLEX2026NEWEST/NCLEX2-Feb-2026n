  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Initiating an alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin) 10-14 days pre-operatively is the highest priority. Pheochromocytomas cause excessive catecholamine (epinephrine, norepinephrine) secretion, leading to intense vasoconstriction and severe hypertension. Alpha-blockade controls blood pressure, preventing a hypertensive crisis during anesthesia or surgical manipulation. This period allows intravascular volume expansion, crucial for hemodynamic stability. ClinicalPearl: Monitor for orthostatic hypotension after initiating alpha-blockers.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker first can cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, leading to a paradoxical hypertensive crisis. Sodium restriction and diuretics are contraindicated because these clients are typically volume-depleted; these interventions would exacerbate hypovolemia and increase the risk of severe hypotension post-operatively. ClinicalPearl: Avoid beta-blockers until adequate alpha-blockade is achieved.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. Administering a beta-blocker first is dangerous. Beta-blockade without preceding alpha-blockade leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation from circulating catecholamines, resulting in severe, uncontrolled vasoconstriction and a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. Beta-blockers are only used after adequate alpha-blockade is achieved, primarily to control reflex tachycardia. Pathophysiology: Beta-blockers block beta receptors, preventing vasodilation. If alpha receptors are not blocked first, the catecholamines will only stimulate alpha receptors, causing severe vasoconstriction.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Incorrect. A sodium-restricted diet is contraindicated. The chronic vasoconstriction caused by excess catecholamines leads to a state of intravascular volume depletion. Pre-operative preparation aims to expand this volume to prevent severe hypotension after tumor removal. Clients are typically encouraged to consume a high-sodium diet and increase fluid intake after alpha-blockade is initiated. Pathophysiology: Pheochromocytoma-induced hypertension leads to pressure natriuresis, contributing to hypovolemia.",

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. This is the correct priority intervention. Alpha-adrenergic blockers are the cornerstone of pre-operative management for pheochromocytoma. They block the effects of catecholamines on blood vessels, leading to vasodilation, which controls hypertension and allows for the necessary expansion of intravascular volume. Starting this therapy 10-14 days prior to surgery provides adequate time to stabilize the client's blood pressure and hemodynamics. Pathophysiology: Alpha-blockers prevent catecholamines from binding to alpha receptors on blood vessels, preventing vasoconstriction and allowing vasodilation.",

        "content": "Incorrect. Administering a loop diuretic is incorrect and would be detrimental. These clients are already volume-depleted. A diuretic would further reduce intravascular volume, increasing the risk of profound hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, especially once the catecholamine-secreting tumor is removed or during anesthesia. Pathophysiology: Diuretics decrease intravascular volume, exacerbating the hypovolemia already present in pheochromocytoma patients due to pressure natriuresis.",
