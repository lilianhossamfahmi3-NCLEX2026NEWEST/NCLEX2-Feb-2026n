    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The priority intervention is to initiate an alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin) 10-14 days pre-operatively. Pheochromocytomas secrete excessive catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to intense vasoconstriction and severe hypertension. Alpha-blockade is essential to control blood pressure and prevent a life-threatening hypertensive crisis that can be triggered by anesthetic induction or surgical manipulation of the tumor. This period also allows for intravascular volume expansion, which is crucial for hemodynamic stability during and after surgery.",
        "incorrect": "The other options represent interventions that are either incorrectly timed, contraindicated, or would worsen the client's condition. Administering a beta-blocker first can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing a paradoxical hypertensive crisis. Sodium restriction and diuretics are contraindicated because these clients are typically volume-depleted due to chronic vasoconstriction; these interventions would exacerbate hypovolemia and increase the risk of severe hypotension post-operatively.",

                "content": "Administering a beta-blocker first is incorrect and dangerous. Beta-blockade without preceding alpha-blockade leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation from circulating catecholamines. This results in severe, uncontrolled vasoconstriction and can precipitate a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. Beta-blockers are only used after adequate alpha-blockade is achieved, primarily to control reflex tachycardia.",
