            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "The presence of crackles in the lungs is a significant cue indicating fluid volume excess and potential pulmonary edema. This is a priority finding that requires immediate assessment and may necessitate more aggressive fluid removal during dialysis."

            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "The client has gained 1.7 kg (84.2 kg - 82.5 kg) since the last treatment. A weight gain of 1-2 kg between dialysis sessions (typically 2-3 days apart) is expected and considered safe. This finding does not require immediate intervention."

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "New onset shortness of breath (dyspnea) is a subjective symptom that corroborates the objective finding of lung crackles. It strongly suggests worsening fluid overload and respiratory compromise, requiring immediate attention."

            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "A soft, continuous bruit (a 'whooshing' sound) heard on auscultation of an AV fistula is an expected and positive finding. It indicates that the fistula is patent and has adequate blood flow for dialysis. This is a sign of a well-functioning access site."

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "A serum potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L (normal range 3.5-5.0 mEq/L) represents severe hyperkalemia. This is a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance that can lead to fatal cardiac dysrhythmias and requires immediate intervention, including prioritizing the client for dialysis."

        "option-6": {
            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Hypotension (BP 92/58 mmHg) prior to hemodialysis is a critical cue. Hemodialysis itself causes fluid shifts that can lead to a significant drop in blood pressure. Starting treatment on a hypotensive client increases the risk of severe intra-dialytic hypotension, cramping, and hemodynamic instability."

        "option-7": {
            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "This statement indicates the client is adhering to the prescribed renal diet, specifically the potassium restriction (oranges and bananas are high in potassium). This is a positive finding related to client education and self-management, not a cue for concern."
