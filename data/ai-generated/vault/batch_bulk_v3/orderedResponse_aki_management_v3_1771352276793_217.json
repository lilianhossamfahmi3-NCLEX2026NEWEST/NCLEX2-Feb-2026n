The client's potassium level of 6.9 mEq/L and ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS) indicate severe cardiotoxicity, placing the client at imminent risk for lethal dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection of arrhythmia and to assess the response to subsequent interventions."

Calcium gluconate directly antagonizes the membrane-depolarizing effects of hyperkalemia, temporarily protecting the heart from fatal arrhythmias. This intervention works rapidly but does not lower the serum potassium level."

IV regular insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into the cells, shifting it from the extracellular to the intracellular space. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia. This is a fast-acting but temporary measure."

A high dose of a loop diuretic like furosemide is given to attempt to stimulate urine output, which would help excrete both excess fluid and potassium. Although its efficacy is reduced in severe AKI (GFR 14), it is a crucial step in managing the fluid overload that is compromising the client's respiratory status."

While this is the ultimate treatment, it is prioritized after immediate life-saving medications because arranging for dialysis (consulting the team, placing a catheter, setting up the machine) takes time."

However, its onset of action is very slow (several hours) and it is not effective for treating acute, life-threatening hyperkalemia. It is therefore the lowest priority intervention in this emergent situation."
