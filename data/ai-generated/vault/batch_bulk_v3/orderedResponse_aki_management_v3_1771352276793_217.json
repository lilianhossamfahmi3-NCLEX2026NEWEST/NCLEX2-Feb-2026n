        "option": "Place the client on a continuous cardiac monitor.",
        "rationale": "The first and most critical action is to ensure client safety and establish continuous monitoring. The client's potassium level of 6.9 mEq/L and ECG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS) indicate severe cardiotoxicity, placing the client at imminent risk for lethal dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for immediate detection of arrhythmia and to assess the response to subsequent interventions. The peaked T waves and widened QRS complex are caused by the effect of hyperkalemia on the myocardial cell membrane, altering its resting potential and slowing repolarization, increasing the risk of ventricular fibrillation or asystole.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Continuous cardiac monitoring is paramount in hyperkalemia to detect and respond to potentially lethal arrhythmias. Be prepared to administer antiarrhythmics or perform emergent pacing if necessary."

        "option": "Administer calcium gluconate 1 gram IV push.",
        "rationale": "After ensuring continuous monitoring, the most urgent pharmacological intervention is to stabilize the myocardium. Calcium gluconate directly antagonizes the membrane-depolarizing effects of hyperkalemia, temporarily protecting the heart from fatal arrhythmias. This intervention works rapidly but does not lower the serum potassium level. Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential of the cardiac cell membrane, making it less excitable and less susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia. This buys time for other interventions to lower the potassium level.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Calcium gluconate is a temporizing measure; it does not lower potassium levels but protects the heart. Administer slowly to avoid bradycardia."

        "rationale": "Once the cardiac membrane is stabilized, the next priority is to rapidly decrease the serum potassium level. IV regular insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into the cells, shifting it from the extracellular to the intracellular space. Dextrose is administered concurrently to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia. This is a fast-acting but temporary measure. Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which actively transports potassium into cells. Dextrose is given to prevent hypoglycemia, as insulin drives glucose into cells as well. The potassium shifts intracellularly, reducing the serum concentration.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor blood glucose closely after insulin administration to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. This intervention is temporary, lasting only a few hours."

        "rationale": "The client has significant fluid volume overload, evidenced by pulmonary crackles, JVD, edema, and hypoxia. A high dose of a loop diuretic like furosemide is given to attempt to stimulate urine output, which would help excrete both excess fluid and potassium. Although its efficacy is reduced in severe AKI (GFR 14), it is a crucial step in managing the fluid overload that is compromising the client's respiratory status. Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, water, and potassium. In AKI, the kidneys' ability to respond to furosemide is diminished, but it can still provide some benefit in reducing fluid overload and promoting potassium excretion.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Monitor urine output and electrolytes closely after furosemide administration. Be aware that furosemide can worsen hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances if the kidneys do not respond adequately."

        "rationale": "Given the severity of the AKI, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload, the client will require definitive treatment with hemodialysis to remove waste products, excess electrolytes, and fluid. While this is the ultimate treatment, it is prioritized after immediate life-saving medications because arranging for dialysis (consulting the team, placing a catheter, setting up the machine) takes time. Hemodialysis uses a semipermeable membrane to filter blood, removing excess fluid, electrolytes (including potassium), and waste products like urea and creatinine. It is the most effective way to rapidly correct severe hyperkalemia and fluid overload in AKI.",

        "option": "Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate 30 grams orally.",
        "rationale": "This medication is a potassium-binding resin that removes potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract. However, its onset of action is very slow (several hours) and it is not effective for treating acute, life-threatening hyperkalemia. It is therefore the lowest priority intervention in this emergent situation. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the intestine. The potassium-bound resin is then excreted in the feces. This process is slow and unreliable, making it unsuitable for acute hyperkalemia.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not a first-line treatment for acute hyperkalemia due to its slow onset of action. Monitor for constipation and sodium overload."

A nephrology consult for emergent hemodialysis is crucial. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not indicated at this time.",
