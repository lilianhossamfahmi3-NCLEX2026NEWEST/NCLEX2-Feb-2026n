      "rationale": "Correct. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential in hypertensive emergencies. The extreme hypertension significantly increases afterload, placing immense strain on the myocardium and increasing the risk for acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and life-threatening dysrhythmias. The monitor allows for immediate detection of ischemic changes (e.g., ST-segment elevation/depression) or arrhythmias. Hypertensive crisis can cause left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, making the heart more susceptible to ischemia.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor for chest pain, shortness of breath, or ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia. Report any abnormalities immediately."

    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "scoring": "-",
      "rationale": "Incorrect. This action is dangerous. The goal for a hypertensive emergency is to lower the MAP by no more than 20-25% in the first hour. A rapid, precipitous drop of 50% can cause severe hypoperfusion to vital organs (brain, heart, kidneys), leading to cerebral ischemia, stroke, or acute kidney injury. The autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired in chronic hypertension, making the brain more vulnerable to rapid blood pressure changes.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Calculate the target MAP reduction (no more than 20-25% in the first hour) and titrate the nicardipine infusion accordingly. Frequent blood pressure monitoring is crucial."

      "isCorrect": true,
      "scoring": "+",
      "rationale": "Correct. The client is exhibiting signs of hypertensive encephalopathy (confusion, severe headache). This condition involves cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, which significantly lowers the seizure threshold. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside) is a critical safety measure. The elevated blood pressure overwhelms the brain's autoregulatory mechanisms, leading to vasogenic edema and increased risk of seizures.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Ensure the availability of emergency medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) for seizure management. Protect the client from injury during a seizure."

      "optionId": "opt_4",
      "isCorrect": true,

      "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., every 15 minutes initially, then every 30 minutes) are crucial to monitor for changes in level of consciousness, pupillary response, and motor function. Worsening confusion, lethargy, or new focal deficits can indicate increasing intracranial pressure or the development of an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage cerebral blood vessels, leading to microaneurysms and increased risk of hemorrhage.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Document neurological findings meticulously and report any changes to the provider immediately. Use a standardized neurological assessment scale (e.g., NIH Stroke Scale)."

      "rationale": "Incorrect. Encouraging oral fluids is contraindicated at this time. The client's confusion and altered level of consciousness place them at a high risk for aspiration. Fluid balance will be managed meticulously with intravenous fluids, not oral intake, until the client's neurological status improves and is stable. In hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebral edema can impair the client's ability to protect their airway.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Maintain NPO status until the client is fully alert and oriented. Assess swallowing function before resuming oral intake."

      "rationale": "Correct. Vasoactive medications like nicardipine must be administered via an infusion pump. This ensures precise, controlled delivery, allowing for careful titration of the dose to achieve the target blood pressure gradually and safely, preventing the dangerous fluctuations that could occur with a gravity drip. Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker that reduces blood pressure by relaxing vascular smooth muscle.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Double-check the nicardipine concentration and infusion rate with another nurse before initiating the infusion. Monitor the client closely for hypotension and adjust the infusion rate as needed."

      "scoring": "+",
      "rationale": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees helps promote cerebral venous drainage, which can assist in lowering intracranial pressure. This position can also improve respiratory mechanics and reduce the work of breathing for a client in acute distress. Elevating the head of the bed reduces hydrostatic pressure in the cerebral vasculature, facilitating venous outflow and reducing cerebral edema.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Avoid placing the client in a Trendelenburg position, which can increase intracranial pressure. Ensure proper body alignment to prevent pressure ulcers."
