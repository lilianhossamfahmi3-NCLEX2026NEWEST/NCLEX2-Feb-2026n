The extreme hypertension places immense strain on the myocardium, increasing the risk for acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and life-threatening dysrhythmias.

A rapid, precipitous drop of 50% can cause severe hypoperfusion to vital organs (brain, heart, kidneys), leading to cerebral ischemia, stroke, or acute kidney injury."

This condition involves cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, which significantly lowers the seizure threshold. Implementing seizure precautions (e.g., padded side rails, suction at bedside) is a critical safety measure."

Worsening confusion, lethargy, or new focal deficits can indicate increasing intracranial pressure or the development of an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke."
