The nurse's assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk and circumferential partial-thickness burns on the entire left arm. There are also superficial burns noted on the patient's face. Using the Rule of Nines, what is the estimated Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) of the burn requiring fluid resuscitation?",

        "correct": "The correct calculation using the Rule of Nines for an adult includes adding the percentages of body surface area affected by partial-thickness and full-thickness burns. The anterior trunk accounts for 18%, and the entire left arm accounts for 9%. Therefore, the total TBSA is 18% + 9% = 27%. Superficial burns are not included in the TBSA calculation for determining fluid resuscitation needs.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect calculations result from omitting one of the burn areas, incorrectly estimating the percentage for a body part, or including superficial burns in the calculation. Each body part in the Rule of Nines has a specific percentage, and it's critical to only include partial and full-thickness burns for fluid resuscitation formulas like the Parkland formula.",

A calculation of 18% only accounts for the full-thickness burn on the anterior trunk and completely omits the 9% from the partial-thickness burn on the entire left arm.

A calculation of 46% likely results from incorrectly including the entire trunk (36%) instead of just the anterior portion (18%), adding the left arm (9%), and then incorrectly adding the face (superficial burns, often estimated at 1% for calculation errors, but should be 0% for fluid resuscitation TBSA). Superficial burns do not cause significant fluid shifts and are excluded from this calculation.",
