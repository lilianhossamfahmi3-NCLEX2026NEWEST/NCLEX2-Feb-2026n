  "stem": "A 45-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department at 1400 following a structural fire. The nurse's assessment reveals full-thickness burns covering the entire anterior trunk and circumferential partial-thickness burns on the entire left arm. There are also superficial burns noted on the patient's face. Using the Rule of Nines, what is the estimated Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) of the burn requiring fluid resuscitation?",

    "correct": "The correct calculation using the Rule of Nines for an adult includes adding the percentages of body surface area affected by partial-thickness and full-thickness burns. The anterior trunk accounts for 18%, and the entire left arm accounts for 9%. Therefore, the total TBSA is 18% + 9% = 27%. Superficial burns are not included in the TBSA calculation for determining fluid resuscitation needs.  \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Accurate TBSA estimation is crucial for calculating fluid resuscitation needs using formulas like the Parkland formula. Under-resuscitation can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ damage, while over-resuscitation can cause pulmonary edema and abdominal compartment syndrome.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect calculations result from omitting one of the burn areas, incorrectly estimating the percentage for a body part, or including superficial burns in the calculation. Each body part in the Rule of Nines has a specific percentage, and it's critical to only include partial and full-thickness burns for fluid resuscitation formulas like the Parkland formula.",

        "optionId": "opt_01",
        "content": "This is incorrect. A calculation of 18% only accounts for the full-thickness burn on the anterior trunk and completely omits the 9% from the partial-thickness burn on the entire left arm. For fluid resuscitation purposes, both partial-thickness and full-thickness burns must be included in the TBSA calculation.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "optionId": "opt_02",
        "content": "This is incorrect. A calculation of 46% likely results from incorrectly including the entire trunk (36%) instead of just the anterior portion (18%), adding the left arm (9%), and then incorrectly adding the face (superficial burns, often estimated at 1% for calculation errors, but should be 0% for fluid resuscitation TBSA). Superficial burns do not cause significant fluid shifts and are excluded from this calculation.",

      {
        "label": "C",
        "optionId": "opt_03",
        "content": "This is correct. Based on the Rule of Nines for an adult, the anterior trunk is 18% and an entire arm is 9%. The sum is 18% + 9% = 27%. This calculation correctly includes both the partial and full-thickness burns and excludes the superficial burns, which is the standard for determining fluid resuscitation requirements.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Partial-thickness and full-thickness burns damage the capillaries, leading to increased capillary permeability. This results in a massive fluid shift from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, causing hypovolemia and edema. Superficial burns, however, primarily affect the epidermis and do not cause significant capillary damage or fluid shifts. Therefore, they are not included in TBSA calculations for fluid resuscitation.",

The assessment finding explicitly states the burn is only on the anterior trunk (18%). This indicates a misreading of the clinical data provided.",
