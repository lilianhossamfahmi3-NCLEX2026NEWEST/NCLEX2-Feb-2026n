    "correct": "Maintaining function and preventing complications are paramount in DMD. Gentle stretching prevents joint contractures, especially in ankles, knees, and hips, delaying loss of ambulation. Low-impact activities like swimming offer cardiovascular benefits, maintain muscle tone, and improve mood without stressing fragile muscle fibers, slowing weakness progression. In DMD, a genetic mutation prevents the production of dystrophin, a protein crucial for muscle fiber integrity. Without dystrophin, muscle fibers are easily damaged during contraction, leading to progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Stretching helps maintain muscle length and flexibility, preventing the shortening and tightening of muscles around joints (contractures). Swimming provides a low-impact form of exercise that strengthens muscles without causing excessive stress and damage. 0700: Assess patient's current mobility level. 0800: Teach parents proper stretching techniques. 1600: Evaluate effectiveness of interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Vigorous exercise accelerates muscle fiber breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). Bed rest leads to rapid muscle atrophy, bone demineralization, and contractures. High-protein diets don't address the dystrophin deficiency and excessive calories can cause obesity, straining musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems. Vigorous exercise causes further muscle damage due to the lack of dystrophin to protect muscle fibers during contraction. Bed rest exacerbates muscle weakness and stiffness, leading to further functional decline. While nutrition is important, the primary issue in DMD is the absence of dystrophin, not a protein deficiency. Excessive calorie intake can lead to weight gain, which places additional stress on weakened muscles and the respiratory system. 0900: Reinforce the importance of avoiding high-impact activities. 1000: Explain the risks of prolonged bed rest.",
