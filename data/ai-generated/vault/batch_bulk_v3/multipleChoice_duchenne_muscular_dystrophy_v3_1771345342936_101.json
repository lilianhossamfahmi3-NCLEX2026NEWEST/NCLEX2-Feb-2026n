The boy is ambulatory but exhibits a Gowers' sign and has difficulty running. Which intervention is most important for the nurse to include in the teaching plan to help maintain the child's current level of function?",

        "correct": "The cornerstone of managing Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is to maintain function and prevent complications for as long as possible. A daily regimen of gentle stretching is critical to prevent joint contractures, particularly of the ankles, knees, and hips, which can hasten the loss of ambulation. Low-impact exercises, such as swimming, provide the benefits of physical activity (cardiovascular health, muscle tone, and improved mood) without placing excessive stress on fragile muscle fibers, thereby slowing the progression of weakness.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent common misconceptions or harmful interventions for DMD. Vigorous exercise is contraindicated as it accelerates muscle fiber breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). Prolonged bed rest is detrimental, leading to rapid muscle atrophy, bone demineralization, and the development of contractures. While nutrition is important, a high-protein diet cannot rebuild muscle in DMD because the underlying problem is a lack of dystrophin, not a nutritional deficiency. Furthermore, excessive calories can lead to obesity, which adds strain to the already weakening musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems.",

                "content": "This is incorrect. The fragile muscle fibers in a child with DMD are easily damaged. Vigorous, high-impact, or eccentric exercises (muscle lengthening while contracting) can accelerate muscle fiber breakdown, leading to a more rapid decline in function and increased inflammation.",
