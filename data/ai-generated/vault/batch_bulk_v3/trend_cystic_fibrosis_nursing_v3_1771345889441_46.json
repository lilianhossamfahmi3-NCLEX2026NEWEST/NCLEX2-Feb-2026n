A decrease in FEV1 % predicted from 65% to 52% indicates a significant decline in pulmonary function. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) measures the amount of air a person can exhale in one second. In CF, mucus buildup obstructs airways, reducing airflow. A decrease of >10% is clinically significant, suggesting increased airway obstruction and inflammation. This triggers a cascade of events, including air trapping, hyperinflation, and increased work of breathing. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** A rapid decline in FEV1 is a key indicator of a pulmonary exacerbation and often precedes other clinical signs. Early intervention can prevent further lung damage.",

An oxygen saturation of 91% on room air indicates hypoxemia.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** In CF, chronic mucus plugging and inflammation lead to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. Some areas of the lung are ventilated but not perfused (or vice versa), impairing gas exchange. Hypoxemia results when the blood is not adequately oxygenated as it passes through the lungs. A SpO2 of 91% indicates that the client's respiratory system is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** While a target SpO2 for CF patients is often >90%, a *new* drop to 91% warrants immediate attention. Chronic hypoxemia can lead to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.",

A change in sputum color to green or yellow indicates the presence of neutrophils and bacterial byproducts, signifying an active infection. Common pathogens include *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Burkholderia cepacia*. The infection triggers an inflammatory response, further damaging the airways. \n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Sputum cultures are essential to identify the specific pathogen and guide antibiotic selection. Early antibiotic treatment can prevent the infection from progressing and causing further lung damage.",
