        "correct": "Effective discharge teaching for a client with myasthenia gravis (MG) focuses on medication management, energy conservation, and recognizing signs of crisis. Key instructions include taking cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine) 30-60 minutes before meals to maximize muscle strength for chewing and swallowing, thus reducing aspiration risk. Energy conservation strategies, such as scheduling activities in the morning when muscle strength is greatest and planning for rest periods, are crucial. The client must be educated on the signs of a myasthenic crisis (e.g., worsening respiratory distress and dysphagia), which is a medical emergency. Wearing a medical alert ID is vital to inform healthcare providers of the diagnosis in an emergency, as certain medications (e.g., aminoglycosides, magnesium sulfate, some anesthetics) can exacerbate MG.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect instructions include dangerous medication practices and unsubstantiated dietary advice. Telling a client to double a missed dose of pyridostigmine is unsafe as it can precipitate a cholinergic crisis, characterized by excessive cholinergic stimulation (e.g., bradycardia, fasciculations, increased salivation, diarrhea). While adequate nutrition is important, there is no evidence to support a specific high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet for MG. The primary dietary focus should be on food consistency (soft, easy-to-chew foods) to accommodate dysphagia, not macronutrient ratios.",

Muscle strength in myasthenia gravis is typically best in the morning after a period of rest and progressively weakens with activity throughout the day.
