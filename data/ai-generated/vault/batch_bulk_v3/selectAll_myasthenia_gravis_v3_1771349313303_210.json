    "correct": "Effective discharge teaching for myasthenia gravis (MG) includes medication management, energy conservation, and recognizing crisis signs. Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, should be taken 30-60 minutes before meals to maximize muscle strength for chewing and swallowing, reducing aspiration risk. Schedule activities in the morning when muscle strength is greatest and plan rest periods. Clients must recognize myasthenic crisis signs (worsening respiratory distress, dysphagia), requiring immediate intervention. A medical alert ID informs providers of the diagnosis in emergencies, as certain medications (aminoglycosides, magnesium sulfate, some anesthetics) can exacerbate MG.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect instructions include dangerous medication practices and unsubstantiated dietary advice. Doubling a missed pyridostigmine dose is unsafe, potentially causing cholinergic crisis (bradycardia, fasciculations, increased salivation, diarrhea). While nutrition is important, no specific high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is recommended for MG. Focus on food consistency (soft, easy-to-chew foods) to accommodate dysphagia, not macronutrient ratios.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Correct. Muscle strength in MG is typically best in the morning after rest and weakens with activity. Scheduling strenuous activities earlier utilizes peak strength and conserves energy.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Myasthenia gravis is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. This is due to antibodies blocking acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, impairing muscle contraction. Morning hours often represent a period of relative rest, allowing for improved neuromuscular transmission and increased muscle strength. Scheduling demanding activities during this time allows the client to maximize their functional capacity and conserve energy for later in the day. This strategy aligns with the principle of energy conservation, a key component of MG management."

        "content": "Incorrect and dangerous. Doubling pyridostigmine can lead to cholinergic crisis, causing severe respiratory distress, bradycardia, and increased secretions, mimicking myasthenic crisis but requiring different treatment.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction. Overdosing can lead to excessive cholinergic stimulation, resulting in a cholinergic crisis. This is characterized by SLUDGE symptoms: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastrointestinal distress, and Emesis. Bradycardia and respiratory distress are also common. Differentiating between cholinergic and myasthenic crises is crucial, as they require opposite treatments. Giving more pyridostigmine during a cholinergic crisis will worsen the condition. The client should never adjust their medication dosage without consulting their healthcare provider."

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. A medical alert ID informs responders of the client's diagnosis in an emergency. Many common medications (certain antibiotics, anesthetics, cardiovascular drugs) can trigger a myasthenic crisis.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "A medical alert bracelet or necklace provides crucial information to healthcare providers in emergency situations, especially if the client is unable to communicate. Myasthenia gravis can be exacerbated by various medications, including certain antibiotics (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones), anesthetics (neuromuscular blocking agents), and cardiovascular drugs (beta-blockers). Knowing the client's diagnosis allows healthcare providers to avoid these medications and provide appropriate treatment promptly. This can be life-saving in the event of a myasthenic crisis."

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Correct. Pyridostigmine improves neuromuscular transmission. Taking it 30-60 minutes before eating strengthens bulbar muscles for chewing and swallowing, reducing choking and aspiration risk.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Pyridostigmine inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability at the neuromuscular junction and improving muscle strength. Taking the medication 30-60 minutes before meals allows it to reach peak effect when the client needs to use their bulbar muscles (muscles involved in speech, swallowing, and facial expression) for chewing and swallowing. This reduces the risk of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and aspiration (food or liquid entering the lungs), which are common complications of myasthenia gravis. Timing the medication with meals is a crucial strategy for managing these symptoms and improving the client's quality of life."

        "content": "Incorrect. While a balanced diet is important, no specific macronutrient ratio like high-protein, low-carbohydrate is recommended for managing MG. The primary dietary concern is food texture and consistency to prevent aspiration due to dysphagia.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "There is no specific dietary recommendation for a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet in the management of myasthenia gravis. The primary dietary focus should be on modifying the texture and consistency of food to prevent aspiration. Soft, easy-to-chew foods are recommended to minimize the effort required for swallowing and reduce the risk of choking. A balanced diet with adequate hydration is important for overall health, but specific macronutrient ratios are not a primary concern. Clients should consult with a registered dietitian for personalized dietary recommendations."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening complication of myasthenia gravis characterized by severe muscle weakness, particularly affecting the respiratory muscles. This can lead to respiratory failure and death. Worsening dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and dyspnea (difficulty breathing) are early warning signs of an impending crisis. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential. The client should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience these symptoms. Treatment typically involves mechanical ventilation, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis, and optimization of medication management."
