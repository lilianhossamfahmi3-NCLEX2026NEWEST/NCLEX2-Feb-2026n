Alert and oriented x3. Appears anxious. Lungs with bibasilar crackles halfway up. S1, S2 audible. 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities to mid-calf. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Furosemide 40 mg IV initiated.\n\n**Day 2, 0900:** Client reports feeling 'a little better'. Less short of breath at rest. Required 2 pillows to sleep. Lung crackles persist but now only in the lower lobes. S1, S2 audible. 2+ pitting edema remains. Urine output over last 24 hours is 2500 mL.\n\n**Day 3, 0900:** Client appears fatigued and confused to date. Complains of severe dyspnea with minimal exertion. Using accessory muscles to breathe. Lungs with coarse crackles throughout all fields. A new S3 heart sound is audible on auscultation. 3+ pitting edema noted to knees. Abdomen appears more distended."
