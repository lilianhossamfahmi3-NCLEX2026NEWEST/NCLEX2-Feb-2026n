Alert and oriented x3. Appears anxious. Lungs with bibasilar crackles halfway up. S1, S2 audible. 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities to mid-calf. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Furosemide 40 mg IV initiated.\n\n**Day 2, 0900 (09:00):** Client reports feeling 'a little better'. Less short of breath at rest. Required 2 pillows to sleep. Lung crackles persist but now only in the lower lobes. S1, S2 audible. 2+ pitting edema remains. Urine output over last 24 hours is 2500 mL.\n\n**Day 3, 0900 (09:00):** Client appears fatigued and confused to date. Complains of severe dyspnea with minimal exertion. Using accessory muscles to breathe. Lungs with coarse crackles throughout all fields. A new S3 heart sound is audible on auscultation. 3+ pitting edema noted to knees. Abdomen appears more distended."

Elevated creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (45 mg/dL) suggest acute kidney injury secondary to reduced renal perfusion. An S3 heart sound indicates increased ventricular filling pressure and volume overload. Hypoxia (SpO2 88%) and tachypnea (RR 32/min) are signs of pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange.
