Reinforcement provided on maintaining consistent sodium and fluid intake while on lithium. Vital signs stable.\n\n**1 Day Ago - Telephone Triage**\nClient called clinic reporting nausea and 3 episodes of watery diarrhea since yesterday. Denied fever or confusion at that time. Advised to increase oral fluid intake, monitor for worsening symptoms, and go to the ED if symptoms do not resolve or if confusion or increased tremors develop.\n\n**Today - Emergency Department**\nClient brought to ED by spouse due to progressive confusion, stumbling gait (ataxia), and noticeable coarse hand tremors. Spouse reports client has been unable to keep fluids down for the past 24 hours. Client is lethargic but arousable. Skin turgor is poor."
