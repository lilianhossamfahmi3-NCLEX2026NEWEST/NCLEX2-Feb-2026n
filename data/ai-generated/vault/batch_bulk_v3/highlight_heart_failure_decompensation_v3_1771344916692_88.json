The client is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Apical pulse is 88 bpm and regular. Blood pressure is 148/88 mmHg. On auscultation, a new S3 heart sound is noted. Lungs have fine crackles in bilateral lower lobes. He reports a 6-lb (2.7 kg) weight gain in the last 3 days. He also states he has been sleeping on three pillows at night to help him breathe. There is 2+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. He denies chest pain or palpitations."

These include the new S3 heart sound (ventricular gallop), fine crackles (pulmonary edema), rapid weight gain (fluid retention), orthopnea (sleeping on three pillows), and peripheral edema. These cues collectively point to both left-sided (pulmonary congestion) and right-sided (systemic congestion) heart failure.",
