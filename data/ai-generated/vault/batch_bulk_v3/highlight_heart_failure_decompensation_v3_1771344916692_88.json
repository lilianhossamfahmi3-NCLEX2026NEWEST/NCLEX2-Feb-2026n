    "text": "A 78-year-old male client with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department at 1400 with increasing shortness of breath. The client is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Apical pulse is 88 bpm and regular. Blood pressure is 148/88 mmHg. On auscultation, a new S3 heart sound is noted. Lungs have fine crackles in bilateral lower lobes. He reports a 6-lb (2.7 kg) weight gain in the last 3 days. He also states he has been sleeping on three pillows at night to help him breathe. There is 2+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. He denies chest pain or palpitations."

    "correct": "The highlighted findings indicate acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). A new S3 heart sound signifies increased ventricular filling pressure and volume overload. Fine crackles in the lungs indicate pulmonary edema due to increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. A 6-lb weight gain in 3 days suggests rapid fluid retention exceeding the kidneys' ability to excrete it. Orthopnea (sleeping on three pillows) reflects pulmonary congestion worsened by lying supine, causing fluid redistribution to the lungs. 2+ pitting edema indicates systemic venous congestion and fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces. In heart failure, the failing heart cannot effectively pump blood, leading to fluid overload and congestion in both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. This congestion manifests as the signs and symptoms observed.",
    "incorrect": "The other findings are either part of the client's baseline history or are not indicative of acute decompensation. Alertness and orientation are normal findings. A history of hypertension and diabetes are risk factors for heart failure but not signs of acute worsening. An apical pulse of 88 bpm is within normal limits. A blood pressure of 148/88 mmHg is elevated but not specific to ADHF. Denying chest pain rules out acute coronary syndrome but doesn't indicate heart failure status.",
