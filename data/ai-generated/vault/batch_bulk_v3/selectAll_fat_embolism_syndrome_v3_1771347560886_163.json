During the morning assessment, the nurse notes several new findings. Which of the following cues should the nurse recognize as being consistent with the development of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES)? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is a serious complication most often associated with long bone fractures. The pathophysiology involves fat globules from the bone marrow entering the circulation and lodging in small vessels, primarily in the lungs, brain, and skin. This leads to a classic triad of clinical manifestations: respiratory distress, neurological changes, and a petechial rash. The client's new onset confusion (neurological), hypoxemia (respiratory), and petechial rash (dermatological) are all hallmark signs of FES and require immediate intervention.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent other potential, but distinct, complications following a femur fracture. Severe, unrelieved pain points towards compartment syndrome. Unilateral calf swelling is a classic sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). While hypotension and tachycardia can occur in late-stage FES due to cardiovascular collapse, they are more immediately indicative of hemorrhagic shock, a common concern with femur fractures. The nurse must differentiate the specific cluster of signs for FES from these other critical conditions.",
