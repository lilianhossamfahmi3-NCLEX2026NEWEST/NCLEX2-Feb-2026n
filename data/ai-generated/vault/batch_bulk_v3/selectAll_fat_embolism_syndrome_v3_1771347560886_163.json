    "correct": "Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is a serious complication most often associated with long bone fractures, particularly fractures of the femur, tibia, and pelvis. It typically occurs 24-72 hours after the injury. The pathophysiology involves the release of fat globules from the bone marrow into the venous circulation. These globules travel to the lungs, brain, and other organs, causing mechanical obstruction and triggering an inflammatory response. In the lungs, fat emboli cause capillary damage, leading to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and hypoxemia. In the brain, they can cause cerebral edema and neurological dysfunction. The petechial rash is thought to be caused by fat emboli and platelet aggregation in dermal capillaries. The classic triad of FES includes respiratory distress (hypoxemia, dyspnea, tachypnea), neurological changes (confusion, restlessness, altered level of consciousness), and a petechial rash. The client's new onset confusion (neurological), hypoxemia (respiratory), and petechial rash (dermatological) are all hallmark signs of FES and require immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options represent other potential, but distinct, complications following a femur fracture. Severe, unrelieved pain points towards compartment syndrome. Unilateral calf swelling is a classic sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). While hypotension and tachycardia can occur in late-stage FES due to cardiovascular collapse, they are more immediately indicative of hemorrhagic shock, a common concern with femur fractures. The nurse must differentiate the specific cluster of signs for FES from these other critical conditions.",

        "content": "This finding describes severe pain that is disproportionate to the injury and unrelieved by analgesics, which is a classic symptom of compartment syndrome, not FES. Compartment syndrome is an orthopedic emergency caused by swelling and increased pressure within a confined space, compromising circulation and nerve function. **Incorrect.**",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure within a muscle compartment, leading to ischemia and potential tissue damage. The '6 Ps' (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, poikilothermia) are key indicators. FES, while also serious, presents with respiratory, neurological, and dermatological manifestations."

        "isCorrect": true,
