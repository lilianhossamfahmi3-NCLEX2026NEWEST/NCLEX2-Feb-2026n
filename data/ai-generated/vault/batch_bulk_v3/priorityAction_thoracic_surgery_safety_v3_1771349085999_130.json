  "question": "The nurse is repositioning a client who is 6 hours post-right lower lobectomy. During the turn, the chest tube becomes disconnected from the chest drainage unit and falls onto the floor. Which action should the nurse take immediately?",
  "stem": "A 68-year-old client is in the thoracic surgery step-down unit following a right lower lobectomy for lung cancer. The client has a chest tube connected to a closed drainage system with a water seal, set to -20 cm H2O suction. The client is alert and oriented, reporting pain as 4/10. While assisting the client to a side-lying position, the nurse accidentally dislodges the chest tube tubing from the collection chamber's connector port.",

      "text": "The scenario presents a critical situation: a chest tube disconnection in a post-lobectomy client. The chest tube system maintains negative pressure in the pleural space, crucial for lung re-expansion. Disconnection compromises the water seal, allowing atmospheric air to enter, potentially leading to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. Immediate action is vital to prevent lung collapse and mediastinal shift.",

        {
          "point": "Post-right lower lobectomy",
          "rationale": "Following a lobectomy, the remaining lung tissue is vulnerable. Maintaining pleural space integrity via the chest tube is paramount to prevent complications like pneumothorax or hemothorax, which can impair respiratory function and oxygenation. The surgery disrupts normal lung mechanics, making the client more susceptible to air leaks and fluid accumulation."

        {
          "point": "Chest tube connected to a closed drainage system with a water seal",
          "rationale": "The water seal acts as a one-way valve, preventing air from re-entering the pleural space during inhalation. This negative pressure system is essential for lung expansion and proper gas exchange. A disruption, such as a disconnection, negates this protective mechanism, creating a direct pathway for air to enter the pleural space."

          "point": "Tubing dislodged from the collection chamber's connector port",
          "rationale": "This is the critical cue. The open chest tube exposes the pleural space to atmospheric pressure. Air rushes into the pleural space, collapsing the lung. This can rapidly escalate to a tension pneumothorax, where trapped air compresses the heart and great vessels, impeding venous return and cardiac output. This requires immediate intervention."

        "rationale": "Clamping the chest tube is generally contraindicated in this situation. While it might prevent further air entry, it also prevents air or fluid already in the pleural space from escaping. This can rapidly lead to a tension pneumothorax, characterized by tracheal deviation, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Clamping is only appropriate in specific, controlled situations (e.g., assessing for air leak location, briefly during drainage system change with specific orders) and requires careful monitoring. The underlying pathophysiology of a tension pneumothorax involves increased intrapleural pressure, compressing the mediastinum and impairing cardiac function.",

This re-establishes the one-way valve mechanism, allowing air to escape from the pleural space during exhalation while preventing atmospheric air from entering during inhalation. This buys time to obtain a new sterile drainage system and prevents a tension pneumothorax. The water acts as a barrier, maintaining negative pressure and preventing lung collapse.",

Delaying intervention to notify the surgeon wastes critical time during which a tension pneumothorax could develop. The nurse should address the immediate threat to the client's respiratory status before contacting the provider. This reflects the principle of prioritizing interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).",

Wiping with an antiseptic wipe is insufficient to ensure sterility. Reconnecting the contaminated tube introduces bacteria into the pleural space, potentially leading to a pleuropulmonary infection or empyema (pus in the pleural space). The entire drainage system must be replaced with a new, sterile unit.",
