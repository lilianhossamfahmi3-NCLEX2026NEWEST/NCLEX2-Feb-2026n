    "question": "The nurse is repositioning a client who is 6 hours post-right lower lobectomy. During the turn, the chest tube becomes disconnected from the chest drainage unit and falls onto the floor. Which action should the nurse take immediately?",
    "stem": "A 68-year-old client is in the thoracic surgery step-down unit following a right lower lobectomy for lung cancer. The client has a chest tube connected to a closed drainage system with a water seal, set to -20 cm H2O suction. The client is alert and oriented, reporting pain as 4/10. While assisting the client to a side-lying position, the nurse accidentally dislodges the chest tube tubing from the collection chamber's connector port.",

            "text": "The scenario describes a common but critical complication in a post-thoracic surgery client. A chest tube system is essential for re-establishing negative pressure in the pleural space, allowing the remaining lung tissue to re-expand. A disconnection from the system breaks the water seal, creating a direct pathway for atmospheric air to enter the pleural space, which can quickly lead to a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening emergency.",

                "rationale": "This action is incorrect and dangerous. While clamping may prevent atmospheric air from entering, it also prevents any air leaking from the client's lung from escaping. This can rapidly cause a tension pneumothorax, as trapped air builds up in the pleural space, compressing the lung and heart. Clamping is only performed for very brief, specific indications (e.g., changing the drainage system) and is not the primary intervention for this emergency."

                "rationale": "This is the priority action. Placing the end of the chest tube 1-2 inches (2-4 cm) below the surface of sterile water or saline immediately re-establishes a water seal. This allows air to bubble out of the pleural space during exhalation but prevents atmospheric air from being drawn in during inhalation. This simple, rapid intervention protects the client from a tension pneumothorax while the nurse prepares to replace the entire drainage unit."

                "rationale": "While the provider must be notified, it is not the immediate priority. The nurse must first intervene to stabilize the client and prevent a life-threatening complication. Notifying the provider before taking action to create a temporary water seal wastes critical time during which a tension pneumothorax could develop."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "rationale": "This action is incorrect. The end of the chest tube and the connector port on the drainage unit are considered contaminated after falling on the floor. Simply wiping them with an antiseptic is insufficient to ensure sterility. Reconnecting the contaminated tube introduces a significant risk of a pleuropulmonary infection or empyema. The priority is to re-establish the water seal; the drainage system will need to be completely replaced with a new sterile unit."
