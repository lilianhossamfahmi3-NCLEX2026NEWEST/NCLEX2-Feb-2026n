    "correct": "The appropriate plan of care for a client with cirrhosis and ascites focuses on managing fluid volume, improving respiratory function, monitoring for complications, and ensuring safety. Key interventions include diuretic therapy (spironolactone is first-line), sodium and fluid restriction to limit further fluid accumulation, positioning to ease breathing by reducing pressure on the diaphragm, and diligent monitoring of fluid status via daily weights and abdominal girth measurements. In cirrhosis, portal hypertension leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the splanchnic circulation, promoting fluid extravasation into the peritoneal cavity (ascites). Reduced albumin synthesis by the damaged liver contributes to decreased oncotic pressure, further exacerbating fluid shifts. Hyperaldosteronism, secondary to decreased hepatic metabolism of aldosterone, causes sodium and water retention by the kidneys.",
    "incorrect": "Administering NSAIDs like ibuprofen is contraindicated as they can impair renal function, reduce the effectiveness of diuretics, and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in clients with cirrhosis. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction in the kidneys, reducing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potentially causing acute kidney injury, especially in patients with underlying renal hypoperfusion due to cirrhosis. Administering 25% albumin is not a routine first-line intervention for stable ascites; it is primarily used to prevent circulatory dysfunction following a large-volume paracentesis, which is not indicated in the stem. Large-volume paracentesis can cause significant intravascular volume depletion, leading to hypotension and renal dysfunction. Albumin administration helps to maintain oncotic pressure and prevent this complication.",

Measuring abdominal girth at the same location (e.g., the umbilicus) provides an objective measure of ascites accumulation or reduction, which is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment.

It counteracts the hyperaldosteronism that contributes to sodium and water retention in cirrhosis, promoting fluid excretion. In cirrhosis, the liver's ability to metabolize aldosterone is impaired, leading to elevated aldosterone levels. Spironolactone blocks the effects of aldosterone in the distal tubules of the kidneys, promoting sodium and water excretion while conserving potassium.",

While the client's albumin is low, the primary indication for intravenous albumin in ascites management is to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction after the removal of a large volume of ascitic fluid (>5 liters).

Fluid restriction (often 1.5 L/day) is also implemented, especially if hyponatremia is present, to help create a negative fluid balance. Sodium restriction reduces the osmotic drive for fluid retention in the intravascular space, decreasing ascites formation. Fluid restriction is particularly important in patients with hyponatremia to prevent further dilution of serum sodium.",
