  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The child's report of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is a classic early sign of ototoxicity, a serious and potentially irreversible adverse effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin. Tobramycin can damage the hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear, leading to hearing loss and balance problems. This damage occurs because aminoglycosides are taken up by these cells and disrupt their function, eventually leading to cell death. The nurse's priority is to prevent further damage to the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve). Therefore, the most appropriate and immediate action is to withhold the next dose of the medication and promptly notify the healthcare provider. The provider may then order a peak and trough level to assess drug concentration, change the antibiotic to a less ototoxic alternative, or adjust the dosage based on the child's renal function and serum drug levels.",
    "incorrect": "Administering the next dose would exacerbate the potential ototoxic damage, leading to further and potentially permanent hearing loss. While an audiometry evaluation is necessary to quantify the extent of hearing loss and establish a baseline, it is not the first action; preventing further harm is the priority. Providing false reassurance is inappropriate as ototoxicity can be permanent and requires immediate medical attention to mitigate long-term effects. Delaying intervention could result in irreversible hearing impairment.",
