        "correct": "The child's report of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is a classic early sign of ototoxicity, a serious and potentially irreversible adverse effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin. The nurse's priority is to prevent further damage to the eighth cranial nerve. Therefore, the most appropriate and immediate action is to withhold the next dose of the medication and promptly notify the healthcare provider. The provider may then order a peak and trough level, change the antibiotic, or adjust the dosage.",
        "incorrect": "Administering the next dose would exacerbate the potential ototoxic damage. While an audiometry evaluation is necessary to quantify hearing loss, it is not the first action; preventing further harm is the priority. Providing false reassurance is inappropriate as ototoxicity can be permanent and requires immediate medical attention.",
