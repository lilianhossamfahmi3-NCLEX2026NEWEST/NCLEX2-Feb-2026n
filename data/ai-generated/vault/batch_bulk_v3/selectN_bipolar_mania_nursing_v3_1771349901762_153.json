    "question": "The nurse is planning care for a 28-year-old client admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit two days ago for an acute manic episode secondary to Bipolar I Disorder. The client is exhibiting hyperactivity, pressured speech, and intrusive behavior towards other clients. Which nursing interventions are appropriate to implement at this time? Select all that apply.",

    "answerBreakdown": [
        {
            "optionId": "opt_1",
            "rationale": "Correct. Clients experiencing acute mania are easily overstimulated. A quiet, low-stimulus environment helps decrease agitation, anxiety, and hyperactivity, promoting a sense of calm and safety."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Competitive activities are highly stimulating and can escalate agitation, irritability, and aggression in a client with mania. Therapeutic activities should be non-competitive and calming, such as walking or simple art projects with a staff member."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "rationale": "Correct. Due to constant physical activity and distractibility, clients in a manic state often have inadequate nutritional and fluid intake, putting them at risk for dehydration and weight loss. High-calorie, high-protein finger foods and drinks are ideal as they can be consumed 'on the go' without requiring the client to sit still for a formal meal."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "rationale": "Correct. Manic clients often have poor impulse control and may violate the personal space and boundaries of others. Setting clear, simple, and consistent limits is a crucial intervention to ensure the safety of the client and others on the unit. These limits should be communicated calmly and non-punitively."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Directly challenging or attempting to logically deconstruct a client's grandiose delusions during an acute manic phase is not therapeutic and may escalate agitation and paranoia. The nurse should not 'feed into' the delusion but should gently reorient the client to reality without confrontation."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "rationale": "Correct. This communication style provides structure and security without being confrontational. A calm, neutral tone avoids escalating the client's mood, while a firm, matter-of-fact approach helps in setting necessary limits and conveying expectations clearly."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_7",
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While close observation is necessary, placing the client in a high-stimulus area like a busy nurses' station is counterproductive. The constant noise and activity can exacerbate mania. The ideal placement is a quiet room that still allows for easy and frequent observation by staff."
