    "prompt": "A nurse on an inpatient psychiatric unit is caring for a 38-year-old client with bipolar I disorder, currently in a manic phase. The nurse observes the client in the dayroom, speaking loudly and rapidly. The client is attempting to persuade another client to invest in a grandiose business scheme. When the other client refuses, the client's speech becomes pressured, and they begin pacing aggressively, shouting, 'You're trying to ruin my future!' Other clients in the room appear visibly distressed and are moving away. Which action should the nurse take first?",

        "prompt": "The nurse must prioritize immediate safety and de-escalation for a client experiencing a manic episode with escalating agitation. The clinical situation presents a client whose behavior is becoming aggressive and disruptive, posing a risk to themselves and others in the milieu. The correct action involves selecting the least restrictive intervention that will effectively reduce stimuli and ensure safety.",
        "options": [
            {
                "text": "Administer the client's prescribed PRN olanzapine for agitation.",
                "rationale": "This is incorrect. While PRN medication may be necessary if the client's agitation continues to escalate, it is not the initial action. Nursing interventions should follow the principle of least restrictiveness. The first step is to attempt de-escalation through environmental management and therapeutic communication before resorting to chemical restraints."

                "rationale": "This is incorrect. Directly confronting a client's grandiose delusion during an acute manic episode is counter-therapeutic. This approach can be perceived as confrontational and invalidating, which is likely to increase the client's frustration, paranoia, and agitation, thereby escalating the situation rather than resolving it."

                "rationale": "This is the correct action. The priority is to maintain safety and de-escalate the client. Removing the client from the stimulating environment of the dayroom reduces external stimuli, which is a key intervention for managing mania. This action protects other clients, helps the agitated client regain self-control, and is the least restrictive, most immediate intervention to ensure safety."

                "text": "Gather the other clients in the dayroom for a community meeting to process the event.",
                "rationale": "This is incorrect. The immediate priority is managing the escalating client and ensuring the safety of the milieu. Addressing the needs of the other clients is important, but it should occur only after the acute situation is resolved and the agitated client is no longer a safety risk. This action incorrectly diverts attention from the primary safety concern."
