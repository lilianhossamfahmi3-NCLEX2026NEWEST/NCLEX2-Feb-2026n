    {
      "optionId": "opt_1",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by the production of abnormally thick mucus that obstructs various organs, including the pancreas. This obstruction leads to pancreatic insufficiency, impairing the secretion of digestive enzymes (lipase, amylase, protease) into the small intestine. Consequently, the digestion and absorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates are compromised, leading to malabsorption and malnutrition. Administering pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with meals and snacks provides exogenous enzymes to facilitate digestion and nutrient absorption, improving nutritional status and reducing steatorrhea (fatty stools).",
      "clinicalPearl": "Administer pancreatic enzymes at the beginning of each meal and snack. Dosage is individualized based on the patient's weight, fat content of the meal, and stool output. Monitor stool for steatorrhea and adjust the dosage accordingly. A dietitian can assist with meal planning and enzyme adjustments."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_2",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Fluid restriction is contraindicated in patients with CF. The thick mucus characteristic of CF can lead to dehydration and further thickening of secretions, exacerbating respiratory problems. Adequate hydration is crucial to thin the mucus, making it easier to clear from the airways through coughing and other airway clearance techniques. Dehydration can also impair mucociliary clearance, increasing the risk of respiratory infections.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Encourage patients to maintain adequate hydration by drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day, especially during exercise and in hot weather. Monitor for signs of dehydration, such as decreased urine output, dry mucous membranes, and poor skin turgor.",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_3",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Regular aerobic exercise is an essential component of CF management. Exercise helps to improve cardiovascular fitness, strengthen respiratory muscles, and mobilize mucus from the airways. Increased respiratory rate and depth during exercise promote airway clearance by facilitating the movement of mucus towards the upper airways, where it can be expectorated. Activities like swimming are particularly beneficial due to the humidified air, which helps to loosen secretions.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Encourage patients to participate in a variety of aerobic activities that they enjoy to promote adherence. Ensure that exercise is incorporated into the daily routine and that appropriate airway clearance techniques are used before and after exercise.",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_4",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Patients with CF have increased energy expenditure due to the chronic inflammation, frequent respiratory infections, and increased work of breathing. Malabsorption of nutrients due to pancreatic insufficiency further contributes to nutritional deficits. A high-calorie, high-fat diet is recommended to meet these increased energy demands, promote growth, and maintain a healthy weight. Fat provides a concentrated source of calories and is essential for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Consult with a registered dietitian to develop an individualized meal plan that meets the patient's specific nutritional needs and preferences. Consider adding high-calorie supplements if needed. Monitor weight and growth regularly to assess nutritional status.",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_5",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While a balanced diet is important, the primary vitamin deficiency concern in CF is related to fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) due to pancreatic insufficiency and subsequent malabsorption of fats. Water-soluble vitamins (B and C) are generally absorbed adequately, even with pancreatic insufficiency. Supplementation with water-soluble vitamins is not typically a priority unless there is a specific indication of deficiency.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Focus on ensuring adequate intake and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Monitor vitamin levels regularly and adjust supplementation as needed.",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_6",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Chest physiotherapy (CPT), which includes percussion, vibration, and postural drainage, is a critical airway clearance technique used to mobilize and remove mucus from the lungs. Performing CPT immediately after meals increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and vomiting, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. CPT should be performed at least one hour before or after meals to minimize this risk.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Schedule CPT at least one hour before or after meals. Coordinate with other airway clearance techniques, such as huff coughing and positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices. Monitor for signs of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation.",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_7",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Pancreatic insufficiency in CF leads to malabsorption of fats, which in turn impairs the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). These vitamins are essential for various physiological functions, including vision (vitamin A), bone health (vitamin D), antioxidant protection (vitamin E), and blood clotting (vitamin K). Supplementation with these specific vitamins in a water-miscible form is a standard part of CF care to prevent complications associated with vitamin deficiencies.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Use water-miscible forms of fat-soluble vitamins to enhance absorption, as they do not require fat for absorption. Monitor for signs and symptoms of vitamin deficiencies, such as night blindness (vitamin A), bone pain (vitamin D), and easy bruising (vitamin K).",
      "highlight": false
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_8",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Coughing is a vital protective mechanism for patients with CF, enabling them to clear thick, sticky mucus from their airways. Suppressing the cough with antitussives can inhibit this clearance, leading to mucus plugging, increased risk of respiratory infections, and worsening respiratory status. Cough suppressants should be avoided unless specifically prescribed by a physician for a non-productive cough that is interfering with sleep or daily activities.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Encourage effective coughing techniques, such as the huff cough, to mobilize secretions. Avoid cough suppressants unless specifically prescribed by a physician. Consider using mucolytics or expectorants to help thin and loosen mucus.",

    "situation": "The nurse is reviewing the home care plan for a 9-year-old child with cystic fibrosis (CF) during a routine wellness visit in the pediatric clinic at 1400.",
    "background": "The child has a confirmed diagnosis of CF and a history of recurrent respiratory infections and pancreatic insufficiency. Current medications include pancreatic enzymes, albuterol inhaler as needed, and multivitamins. Parents report difficulty managing the child's cough and ensuring adequate nutrition.",
    "assessment": "The nurse's assessment reveals the child's current home care plan may not be fully optimized to address the specific challenges of CF. The child's persistent cough, potential for malabsorption, and need for airway clearance require a comprehensive and updated approach.",
    "recommendation": "The nurse recommends updating the home care plan to include consistent pancreatic enzyme administration with all meals and snacks, regular aerobic exercise, a high-calorie, high-fat diet, and supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). The nurse will also educate the parents on effective airway clearance techniques and the importance of avoiding cough suppressants unless specifically prescribed by the physician. A referral to a registered dietitian is recommended to optimize the child's nutritional status."
