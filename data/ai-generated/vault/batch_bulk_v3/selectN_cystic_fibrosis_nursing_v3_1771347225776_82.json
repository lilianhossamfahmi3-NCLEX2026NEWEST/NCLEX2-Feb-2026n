The nurse is reviewing the home care plan with the child's parents to optimize health and prevent complications. Which interventions should the nurse include in the updated plan of care?

            "optionId": "opt_1",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. In cystic fibrosis, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic ducts, leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This prevents digestive enzymes from reaching the small intestine, causing malabsorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Administering pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with all meals and snacks is essential to facilitate digestion and nutrient absorption."

            "optionId": "opt_2",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Patients with CF require increased fluid intake, not restriction. Adequate hydration is crucial to thin the characteristically thick respiratory secretions, making them easier to clear. It also helps prevent dehydration, as individuals with CF lose excessive salt and water through sweat."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_3",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Regular aerobic exercise is a key component of CF management. It helps to improve or maintain lung function, strengthen respiratory muscles, and mobilize mucus from the airways, acting as a form of airway clearance. Activities like swimming and soccer are highly beneficial."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_4",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Due to malabsorption and increased energy expenditure from the work of breathing and chronic inflammation, patients with CF have high caloric needs. A diet high in calories, fat, protein, and salt is recommended to meet these demands, promote adequate growth, and maintain a healthy weight."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_5",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While a balanced diet is important, the primary vitamin deficiency concern in CF is related to fat-soluble vitamins, not water-soluble ones. Pancreatic insufficiency impairs the absorption of fats, and therefore the absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, which require fat for transport. Water-soluble vitamins are generally absorbed adequately."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_6",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Chest physiotherapy (CPT), which includes percussion and postural drainage, is a critical airway clearance technique. However, it should be performed before meals or at least one hour after eating. Performing CPT immediately after a meal increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting."

        {
            "optionId": "opt_7",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. Malabsorption of fat due to pancreatic insufficiency directly leads to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Supplementation with these specific vitamins in a water-miscible form is a standard part of CF care to prevent complications like poor vision, bone disease, and bleeding disorders."
        },
        {
            "optionId": "opt_8",
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Coughing is a vital protective mechanism for patients with CF, enabling them to clear thick, sticky mucus from their airways. Administering cough suppressants (antitussives) is contraindicated as it would inhibit this clearance, leading to mucus plugging, increased risk of infection, and worsening respiratory status."
