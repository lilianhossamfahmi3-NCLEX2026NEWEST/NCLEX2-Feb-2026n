    "correct": "The correct selections reflect key nursing actions and patient education for managing Cushing's syndrome. Excess cortisol, a glucocorticoid, exhibits mineralocorticoid effects, leading to sodium and water retention and potassium excretion; hence, a low-sodium, high-potassium diet is crucial. Cortisol's immunosuppressive nature elevates infection risk. Protein catabolism results in thin, fragile skin, necessitating gentle skin care. Metabolically, cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis and diminishes peripheral glucose uptake, causing hyperglycemia and increased insulin resistance, requiring regular blood glucose monitoring.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections misrepresent Cushing's syndrome pathophysiology, potentially worsening symptoms or complications. A high-sodium, low-potassium diet exacerbates fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia. A low-protein diet worsens muscle wasting and impairs wound healing. Believing cortisol enhances immunity provides a false sense of security. Harsh skin care damages fragile skin. Misunderstanding cortisol's effect on blood glucose leads to unmanaged hyperglycemia.",
