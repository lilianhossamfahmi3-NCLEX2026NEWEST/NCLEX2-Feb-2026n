        "correct": "The correct selections reflect the key nursing actions and patient education points for managing Cushing's syndrome. Excess cortisol (a glucocorticoid) has mineralocorticoid effects, causing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion; therefore, a diet low in sodium and high in potassium is indicated. Cortisol is immunosuppressive, increasing the risk of infection. It also causes protein catabolism, leading to thin, fragile skin that bruises and tears easily, necessitating gentle skin care. Metabolically, cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis and decreases peripheral glucose uptake, leading to hyperglycemia and increased insulin resistance, which requires regular blood glucose monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect selections misrepresent the pathophysiology of Cushing's syndrome and would lead to worsening of symptoms or complications. A high-sodium, low-potassium diet would exacerbate fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia. A low-protein diet would worsen muscle wasting and poor wound healing. Believing cortisol enhances the immune system provides a false sense of security against infection. Harsh skin care or using strong adhesives will cause skin breakdown and injury. Misunderstanding the effect of cortisol on blood glucose could lead to unmanaged hyperglycemia and its associated complications.",
