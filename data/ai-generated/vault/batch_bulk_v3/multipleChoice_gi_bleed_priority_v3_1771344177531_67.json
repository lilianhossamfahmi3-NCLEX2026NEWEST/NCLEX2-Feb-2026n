The client is anxious, pale, and diaphoretic. Vital signs are: heart rate 122 bpm, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and SpO2 94% on room air. The nurse has just received orders from the healthcare provider. Which action should the nurse take first?",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting clear signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis) due to an active upper GI bleed. The absolute first priority is to establish vascular access for rapid fluid resuscitation and potential blood product administration. Securing two large-bore IVs is a critical life-saving intervention that directly addresses the immediate threat to circulation (the 'C' in ABCs) and is a prerequisite for all other treatments.",
        "incorrect": "While the other options are appropriate interventions for a GI bleed, they are not the immediate priority. Administering a PPI is important to decrease gastric acid and reduce re-bleeding risk, but it does not address the acute volume loss. Preparing for an EGD is necessary for diagnosis and treatment, but the client must be hemodynamically stabilized first. Inserting an NG tube is a secondary intervention and is not prioritized over resuscitation.",

While administering a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like pantoprazole is a standard of care to suppress acid and prevent re-bleeding, it does not address the immediate life-threatening problem of acute blood volume loss. The patient's hemodynamic instability (BP 88/50, HR 122) must be addressed first through fluid resuscitation.",

According to airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) principles, addressing the circulatory collapse is the highest priority.
