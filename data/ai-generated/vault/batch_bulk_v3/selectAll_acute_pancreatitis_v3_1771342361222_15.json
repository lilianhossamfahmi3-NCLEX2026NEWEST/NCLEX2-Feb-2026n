        "correct": "The priority initial interventions for acute pancreatitis focus on stabilizing hemodynamics, managing severe pain, and resting the pancreas to prevent further autodigestion. This includes aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to combat third-spacing and hypovolemia, administration of IV opioids for pain control, maintaining NPO status to reduce pancreatic stimulation, and positioning for comfort.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that are not universally required, such as NG tube placement, or are indicated for chronic pancreatitis, like pancreatic enzyme replacement, are incorrect for the initial management of acute pancreatitis. NG suction is reserved for clients with intractable vomiting or ileus, and enzyme replacement is used for exocrine insufficiency, not in the acute inflammatory phase.",
