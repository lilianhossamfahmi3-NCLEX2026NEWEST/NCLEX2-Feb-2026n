  "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted to the emergency department at 1400 with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The client reports severe, boring epigastric pain radiating to the back. The nurse notes the client is tachycardic and hypotensive. Which actions should the nurse prioritize in the initial plan of care? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The priority in acute pancreatitis is to reduce pancreatic stimulation, manage pain, and restore hemodynamic stability. NPO status rests the pancreas, reducing enzyme secretion. IV fluids correct hypovolemia from third-spacing. Opioids manage severe pain, decreasing metabolic demand. Positioning can alleviate discomfort.",
