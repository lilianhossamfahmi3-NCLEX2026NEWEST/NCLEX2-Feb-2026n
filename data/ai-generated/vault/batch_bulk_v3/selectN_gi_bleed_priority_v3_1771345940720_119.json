    "question": "A 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and known esophageal varices is brought to the emergency department after vomiting a large amount of bright red blood. The patient is pale, diaphoretic, and anxious. Vital signs are: Blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, Heart rate 128 beats/min, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? (Select all that apply.)",

        "correct": "The patient is experiencing acute variceal hemorrhage, a life-threatening emergency. The immediate priorities are to stabilize hemodynamics, protect the airway, reduce portal pressure to control bleeding, and monitor for complications. Establishing two large-bore IVs is critical for rapid volume resuscitation with crystalloids and blood products. Preparing octreotide is a first-line pharmacologic intervention to decrease splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, thereby reducing variceal bleeding. Ensuring suction is available is essential for airway protection due to the high risk of aspiration from ongoing hematemesis. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary to detect dysrhythmias and signs of myocardial ischemia resulting from profound hypovolemia and tachycardia.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect actions are either not immediate priorities or are contraindicated. Administering lactulose treats hepatic encephalopathy, which can be precipitated by a GI bleed, but it does not address the acute life-threatening hemorrhage. Inserting an NG tube is controversial and potentially dangerous as it can traumatize existing varices and worsen the bleeding. Administering a PPI is a standard treatment for non-variceal upper GI bleeds (e.g., peptic ulcers) but is not the priority medication for an acute variceal bleed; octreotide is the primary medication. While a PPI may be given later, it is not an immediate, life-saving action in this specific context.",
