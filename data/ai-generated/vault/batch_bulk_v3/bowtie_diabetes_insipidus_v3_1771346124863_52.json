      "rationale": "The client is most likely experiencing Diabetes Insipidus (DI). Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy can damage the pituitary gland, leading to a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This deficiency prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water, resulting in polyuria (450 mL/hr), polydipsia (intense thirst), hypernatremia (154 mEq/L), elevated serum osmolality (315 mOsm/kg), and low urine specific gravity (1.002). The body attempts to compensate for the fluid loss by stimulating thirst. Without ADH, the kidneys continue to excrete large volumes of dilute urine, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for signs of dehydration, including tachycardia (118 bpm) and hypotension (94/58 mmHg). Report any significant changes in neurological status, as severe hypernatremia can lead to seizures or coma."
