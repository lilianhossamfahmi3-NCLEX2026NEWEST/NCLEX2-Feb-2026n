        "correct": "The most critical interpretation is that the client's statement is a covert suicidal threat. Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs like fluoxetine, often increase a client's energy level before improving their mood (anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness). This creates a dangerous period, typically 2-4 weeks after starting the medication, where the client may now have the physical energy and cognitive ability to carry out a suicide plan they previously lacked the motivation to execute. The phrase 'put my plan into action' is a significant red flag requiring immediate safety assessment.",
        "incorrect": "The other options represent misinterpretations of the client's statement that could compromise safety. Attributing the statement to positive coping, improved mood, or a less critical side effect like akathisia overlooks the immediate and life-threatening risk of suicide. While these could be possibilities in other contexts, the combination of a recent antidepressant start, increased energy, and ambiguous but ominous language about a 'plan' makes suicide risk the primary concern.",

While the nurse should explore the meaning of the client's statement, assuming it relates to positive treatment planning ignores the significant risk factors present.

The energy to act on suicidal thoughts often returns before the depressive mood lifts. The statement 'put my plan into action' is a veiled, or covert, clue to a potential suicide attempt and must be investigated immediately as the top priority.",
