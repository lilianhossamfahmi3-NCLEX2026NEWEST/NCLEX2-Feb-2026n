    "correct": "The priority interpretation is that the client's statement is a covert suicidal threat. Fluoxetine, an SSRI, can increase energy levels before improving mood (anhedonia, hopelessness). This creates a high-risk period (2-4 weeks post-initiation) where the client now possesses the energy to enact a suicide plan. The phrase 'put my plan into action' is a critical red flag. At 1400, the nurse must immediately assess the client's safety and suicidal intent. \n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Always prioritize safety when a client on antidepressants exhibits increased energy with ambiguous statements about plans.",
    "incorrect": "The other options misinterpret the client's statement, potentially compromising safety. Attributing the statement to positive coping, improved mood, or akathisia overlooks the immediate suicide risk. While these are possibilities in other contexts, the recent antidepressant start, increased energy, and ominous language about a 'plan' make suicide the primary concern.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Never dismiss ambiguous statements from clients with a history of suicidal ideation, especially during the initial weeks of antidepressant therapy.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Incorrect. Assuming positive treatment planning ignores the significant risk factors. The ambiguity of 'my plan,' suicidal ideation history, and increased energy require prioritizing safety and ruling out suicide first.",

      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Correct. The client's newfound energy, occurring about two weeks into fluoxetine therapy, is a classic warning sign. The energy to act on suicidal thoughts often returns before the depressive mood lifts. The statement 'put my plan into action' is a veiled clue to a potential suicide attempt and must be investigated immediately as the top priority.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Incorrect. Increased energy does not equate to a resolution of depression or suicidality. A positive outlook is not guaranteed, and the risk of suicide is actually heightened during this initial phase of treatment.",

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Incorrect. While akathisia is a possible side effect of SSRIs, the client's verbal statement points more specifically to cognitive planning and intent ('figured everything out... put my plan into action') rather than just physical restlessness. The primary concern derived from the verbal cue is the risk of self-harm, not a movement disorder.",

      }
    ],
    "pathophysiology": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and impaired functioning. Suicidal ideation is a serious complication. SSRIs like fluoxetine increase serotonin levels in the brain. Initially, this can increase energy before mood improves due to the complex neurochemical adaptations required for mood stabilization. This lag time creates a window of increased suicide risk. The client now has the energy to act on pre-existing suicidal thoughts. The nurse must recognize this critical period and intervene to ensure safety."
