    "question": "A 68-year-old client arrives in the emergency department with a 45-minute history of crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left jaw, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. Vital signs are: BP 148/92 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 91% on room air. The provider gives a set of orders to be implemented immediately for a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In which order should the nurse perform these actions? Drag the interventions from the left to the right, placing them in the correct sequence from first to last.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence of interventions for a client with a suspected STEMI follows the principle of prioritizing airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), followed by critical diagnostics and time-sensitive medications. The first priority is to correct the client's hypoxemia (SpO2 91%) by administering oxygen. Next, obtaining a 12-lead ECG is the essential diagnostic step to confirm STEMI and activate the cardiac catheterization lab for reperfusion. This must be completed within 10 minutes of arrival. Aspirin is then given for its crucial antiplatelet effect. Nitroglycerin follows to reduce cardiac workload and alleviate ischemic pain. Finally, morphine is administered for pain that is unrelieved by nitroglycerin.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence is incorrect because it deviates from established evidence-based protocols for acute STEMI management. For instance, delaying oxygen administration would fail to address the immediate life threat of hypoxemia and ongoing myocardial ischemia. Delaying the ECG would postpone definitive diagnosis and life-saving reperfusion therapy. Administering morphine before nitroglycerin is not the standard protocol, as nitroglycerin is the first-line agent for ischemic pain relief, and morphine is reserved for refractory pain.",

                "explanation": "After addressing immediate oxygenation needs, the most critical diagnostic action is to obtain a 12-lead ECG. This confirms the diagnosis of STEMI, identifies the location of the infarction, and is required to activate the cardiac catheterization team for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The goal is a door-to-ECG time of less than 10 minutes."
