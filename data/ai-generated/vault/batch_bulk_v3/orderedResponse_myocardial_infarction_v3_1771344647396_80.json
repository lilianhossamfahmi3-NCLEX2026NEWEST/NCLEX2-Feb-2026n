  "question": "A 68-year-old client arrives in the emergency department at 1400 with a 45-minute history of crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left jaw, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. Vital signs are: BP 148/92 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 91% on room air. The provider gives a set of orders to be implemented immediately for a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In which order should the nurse perform these actions? Drag the interventions from the left to the right, placing them in the correct sequence from first to last.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes rapid assessment and intervention in a suspected STEMI to minimize myocardial damage. This follows the principles of airway, breathing, circulation (ABC), diagnostics, and targeted therapies. First, address hypoxemia with oxygen. Then, obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival to confirm STEMI and activate the cardiac catheterization lab. Administer aspirin for its antiplatelet effects. Next, administer nitroglycerin to reduce preload and afterload. Finally, administer morphine for pain unrelieved by nitroglycerin.",
    "incorrect": "Any other sequence delays critical interventions and can lead to increased myocardial damage and poorer outcomes. Delaying oxygen administration exacerbates hypoxemia and ischemia. Delaying the ECG postpones diagnosis and reperfusion therapy. Administering morphine before nitroglycerin deviates from standard protocol, as nitroglycerin is the first-line agent for ischemic pain.",

        "content": "Administer oxygen 2 L/min via nasal cannula.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "The client's SpO2 of 91% indicates hypoxemia, compromising oxygen delivery to the myocardium. Administering oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, enhancing oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries and subsequently increasing arterial oxygen saturation. This improves myocardial oxygen supply, reducing ischemic damage. Clinical Pearl: Monitor SpO2 continuously and adjust oxygen flow to maintain SpO2 > 95%."

        "label": "2",
        "content": "Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "A 12-lead ECG is crucial for diagnosing STEMI by identifying ST-segment elevation, indicating acute myocardial injury. The ECG helps pinpoint the location and extent of the infarction, guiding treatment decisions. Rapid ECG acquisition (within 10 minutes of arrival) is essential for timely activation of the cardiac catheterization lab for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Clinical Pearl: Ensure proper lead placement and minimize artifact for accurate ECG interpretation. Document the time the ECG was obtained.",
        "pathophysiology": "STEMI occurs when a coronary artery is completely occluded, leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and injury. The ST-segment elevation on the ECG reflects this acute injury pattern. Rapid identification of STEMI is critical to restore blood flow and prevent irreversible myocardial damage."

        "label": "3",
        "content": "Administer chewable aspirin 324 mg.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Aspirin is a potent antiplatelet agent that inhibits thromboxane A2 production, preventing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. In STEMI, aspirin reduces the risk of further coronary artery occlusion and improves outcomes. Chewable aspirin is preferred for faster absorption. Clinical Pearl: Confirm the client has no known aspirin allergy or contraindications (e.g., active bleeding) before administration.",
        "pathophysiology": "Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which are responsible for the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting thromboxane A2, aspirin reduces platelet activation and aggregation, preventing further thrombus formation in the coronary artery."

        "content": "Administer sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and alleviating ischemic chest pain. It dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. The client's BP of 148/92 mmHg is generally stable enough to tolerate nitroglycerin, but monitor closely for hypotension. Clinical Pearl: Assess blood pressure before and after nitroglycerin administration. Hold if systolic BP < 90 mmHg.",
        "pathophysiology": "Nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in the vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. Venodilation reduces preload (the volume of blood returning to the heart), while arterial dilation reduces afterload (the resistance the heart must pump against). These effects decrease myocardial oxygen demand and alleviate ischemic pain."

      {
        "label": "5",
        "content": "Administer morphine sulfate 2 mg IV.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Morphine is indicated for chest pain that is unresponsive to nitroglycerin. It acts as an analgesic and anxiolytic, reducing pain and anxiety associated with STEMI. Morphine also has venodilating properties, further reducing preload and myocardial oxygen consumption. Clinical Pearl: Monitor respiratory rate and blood pressure closely after morphine administration, as it can cause respiratory depression and hypotension.",
        "pathophysiology": "Morphine binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing the perception of pain and promoting relaxation. Its venodilating effects reduce preload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. However, morphine can also cause respiratory depression and hypotension, requiring careful monitoring."
