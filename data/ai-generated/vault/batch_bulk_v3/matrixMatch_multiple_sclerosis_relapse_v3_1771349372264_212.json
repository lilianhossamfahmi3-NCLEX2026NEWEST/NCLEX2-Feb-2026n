        "correct": "The correct plan of care for an acute MS relapse focuses on three main goals: shortening the duration and severity of the relapse, managing debilitating symptoms, and preventing complications. High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are the first-line treatment to reduce CNS inflammation. Symptom management is crucial, including using antispasmodics like baclofen for spasticity and addressing neurogenic bladder with self-catheterization. Plasmapheresis is an appropriate second-line therapy for severe relapses that do not respond to steroids. Interventions that can exacerbate symptoms, such as heat application or strenuous exercise, must be avoided.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect plan of care fails to distinguish between acute relapse management and chronic disease management. Initiating a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during an acute relapse is not the priority; DMTs are used to prevent future relapses, not treat current ones. Furthermore, applying interventions that are harmful to MS patients, such as heat (which can cause Uhthoff's phenomenon) or strenuous physical activity (which can worsen fatigue and neurological deficits), demonstrates a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease during an exacerbation.",
