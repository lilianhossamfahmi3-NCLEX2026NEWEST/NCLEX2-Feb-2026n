    "correct": "The correct plan of care for an acute MS relapse focuses on reducing inflammation, managing symptoms, and preventing complications. High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are first-line, decreasing CNS inflammation by suppressing the immune response and reducing edema around demyelinated areas. Symptom management includes antispasmodics like baclofen for spasticity, which arises from upper motor neuron lesions disrupting inhibitory signals, leading to increased muscle tone. Intermittent self-catheterization addresses neurogenic bladder, preventing urinary stasis and UTIs. Plasmapheresis, a second-line therapy for severe steroid-resistant relapses, removes antibodies attacking myelin. Heat exacerbates symptoms (Uhthoff's phenomenon) due to impaired nerve conduction in demyelinated axons at higher temperatures. Strenuous exercise worsens fatigue due to increased energy demands and impaired neuronal transmission.",
    "incorrect": "An incorrect plan neglects the acute vs. chronic management distinction. DMTs prevent future relapses by modulating the immune system to reduce myelin damage over time, but are ineffective for acute inflammation. Applying heat worsens Uhthoff's phenomenon, temporarily blocking nerve conduction. Strenuous exercise depletes energy reserves, exacerbating fatigue and potentially worsening neurological deficits due to increased metabolic demands on already compromised neurons. Failing to manage bladder dysfunction leads to urinary retention, increasing UTI risk and potential kidney damage.",

They reduce inflammation and edema at demyelination sites in the CNS, shortening the relapse duration and lessening severity.
