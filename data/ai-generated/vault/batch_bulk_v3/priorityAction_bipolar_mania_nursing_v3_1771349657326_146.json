    "question": "A nurse on an inpatient psychiatric unit is caring for a 28-year-old male client admitted 12 hours ago for a severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder. The nurse observes the client in the dayroom rapidly pacing, speaking loudly, and attempting to organize other clients into a 'surprise party' for the unit manager. When another client declines to participate, the client with mania clenches his fists and verbally threatens, 'You're either with me or against me!' Which action should the nurse take first?",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "opt_1": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While PRN medication may eventually be needed to manage agitation, it is not the first action. The principle of least restrictive intervention requires the nurse to first attempt verbal de-escalation and environmental management. Administering medication without first trying to de-escalate the situation through other means would be premature unless the client is immediately physically violent."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Directly confronting the client and setting limits in a demanding tone is likely to be perceived as a challenge, which can escalate their irritability and agitation. This approach is counter-therapeutic and can provoke a more aggressive response from a client experiencing mania due to their poor impulse control and grandiose thinking."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "rationale": "Correct. The client's behavior (pacing, loud speech, clenched fists, threats) indicates significant escalation and a risk to the safety of others. The priority action is to reduce environmental stimuli and remove the client from the audience of other patients. Moving the client to a quiet, low-stimulus environment is the initial and most effective de-escalation technique to ensure the safety of everyone on the unit and provide an opportunity for one-on-one intervention."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. This is an overreaction at this stage. Security should be called when there is an imminent threat of physical violence that cannot be managed by the nursing staff. The client is verbally threatening but has not yet become physically aggressive. Involving security prematurely can be intimidating for the client, escalate their agitation, and undermine the therapeutic rapport between the nurse and client."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "rationale": "Incorrect. While the safety of other clients is important, the primary focus must be on de-escalating the agitated client who poses the immediate risk. Addressing the other clients first would delay the critical intervention needed for the client with mania, allowing their agitation to potentially escalate further into physical aggression."
