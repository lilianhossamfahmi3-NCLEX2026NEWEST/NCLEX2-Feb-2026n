        "correct": "The highest priority for a newborn with an exposed myelomeningocele is to protect the sac from injury, rupture, and infection. Applying a sterile, moist, non-adherent dressing prevents the delicate neural tissue from drying out (desiccation), which can cause irreversible damage. It also provides a barrier against pathogens, reducing the significant risk of meningitis. This action directly addresses the most immediate threat to the infant's neurological integrity and survival.",
        "incorrect": "While other actions are important components of care for this infant, they are not the immediate priority. Baseline assessments (head circumference, neurological exam) are crucial for monitoring but do not prevent the primary threat of sac rupture and infection. Administering antibiotics is vital for preventing infection but is secondary to establishing a physical barrier. Applying a diaper is contraindicated as it can cause pressure on the sac and introduce fecal bacteria.",
