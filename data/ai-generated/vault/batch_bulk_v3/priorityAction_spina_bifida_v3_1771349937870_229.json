    "correct": "Applying a sterile, warm saline-soaked, non-adherent dressing to the myelomeningocele sac is the *highest* priority. The exposed neural tissue is extremely vulnerable to injury, desiccation, and infection. The moist dressing maintains tissue integrity, prevents drying, and provides a barrier against pathogens, significantly reducing the risk of meningitis and further neurological damage. This action directly addresses the immediate threat to the infant's well-being.",
    "incorrect": "Obtaining a baseline head circumference (A) and performing a neurological assessment (E) are important assessments but do not address the immediate risk of sac rupture or infection. Administering ampicillin (C) is crucial for preventing infection but is secondary to protecting the sac. Placing a diaper (D) is contraindicated as it can cause pressure on the sac and introduce fecal bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.",

    "Educate parents about proper care of the myelomeningocele and potential complications."
  ],
  "pathophysiologyRationale": "Myelomeningocele results from the failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development (around the 3rd-4th week of gestation). This incomplete closure leads to a defect in the vertebral arches and exposure of the spinal cord and meninges. The exposed neural tissue lacks the protective covering of skin and bone, making it highly susceptible to mechanical trauma, desiccation, and infection. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the meningeal sac can leak, further increasing the risk of infection and potentially leading to meningitis. The severity of neurological deficits depends on the level and extent of the spinal cord involvement. Prompt protection of the sac is crucial to prevent irreversible neurological damage and life-threatening complications.",
