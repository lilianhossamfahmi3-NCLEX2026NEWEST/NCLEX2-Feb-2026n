    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system. Sertraline (SSRI) and tramadol (opioid analgesic with SNRI properties) both increase serotonin levels, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome when taken together. The client's reported symptoms – tachycardia, diaphoresis, restlessness/agitation, tremor, and muscle rigidity/tightness (especially in the legs) – are classic manifestations. The immediate priority is client safety. Instructing the client to go to the nearest emergency department ensures prompt medical evaluation and intervention. Following this, notifying the prescribing provider is crucial for informing them of the client's condition and the actions taken, facilitating appropriate follow-up care and medication management.",
    "incorrect": "Any action that delays immediate emergency care or could potentially worsen the client's condition is incorrect. Monitoring symptoms at home is unsafe due to the rapid progression of serotonin syndrome. Stopping sertraline without immediate evaluation is also unsafe. Administering tramadol would exacerbate the syndrome. While documentation is important, notifying the provider about the immediate plan of care takes precedence. Scheduling a future appointment is insufficient for an acute, life-threatening condition. Educating on common side effects of sertraline is inappropriate as the client is experiencing a serious adverse reaction, not typical side effects.",
