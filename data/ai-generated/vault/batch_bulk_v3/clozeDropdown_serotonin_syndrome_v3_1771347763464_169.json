        "correct": "The client is taking two serotonergic agents (sertraline and tramadol), and their symptoms (tachycardia, diaphoresis, restlessness/agitation, tremor, and muscle rigidity/tightness) are classic signs of serotonin syndrome. This is a life-threatening medical emergency. The nurse's first and most critical action is to ensure client safety by instructing them to seek immediate emergency medical care. After providing this urgent directive, the nurse's next priority is to notify the prescribing provider to inform them of the client's acute condition and the actions taken. This ensures continuity of care and facilitates appropriate follow-up.",
        "incorrect": "Any action that delays emergency care or could potentially worsen the client's condition is incorrect. Simply monitoring symptoms at home is unsafe as serotonin syndrome can progress rapidly. Stopping the medication without seeking immediate evaluation is also unsafe. Administering another serotonergic agent (tramadol) would dangerously exacerbate the syndrome. After advising the client, notifying the provider is the priority over documentation or scheduling a future appointment because it directly pertains to the immediate plan of care and management.",
