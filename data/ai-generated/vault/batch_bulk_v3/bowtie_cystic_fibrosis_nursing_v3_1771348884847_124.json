CF exacerbations are characterized by increased inflammation and mucus plugging in the airways, leading to impaired gas exchange and increased risk of infection.",

Pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the pleural space, causing lung collapse.",

While it can cause wheezing and thick sputum, the sputum is often brownish, and the presentation is less acute than this client's. A definitive diagnosis requires specific immunologic testing (e.g., IgE levels, precipitins), and an acute bacterial infection is more likely given the purulent sputum and fever. ABPA leads to chronic inflammation and bronchiectasis.",

While the client has tachycardia, key signs like jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and hepatomegaly are absent. This is an acute infectious process, not chronic heart failure. Chronic hypoxemia leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased right ventricular workload.",

A short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) will help open the airways, relieve dyspnea, and improve the effectiveness of subsequent airway clearance techniques. Bronchodilators stimulate beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causing smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.",

Identifying the specific causative organism (commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF) and its antibiotic susceptibilities is essential for effective treatment of the exacerbation. Sputum cultures identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, while sensitivity testing determines which antibiotics will be effective.",

Performing CPT on constricted airways can worsen bronchospasm and dyspnea. Bronchodilators should be administered 15-30 minutes prior to CPT.",

Furthermore, the client has a decreased appetite, and focusing on feeding is inappropriate until their respiratory status is stabilized. CF patients require a high-calorie, high-fat diet to compensate for malabsorption and increased energy expenditure due to chronic lung disease.",

Weight loss can indicate malnutrition and increased energy expenditure.",
