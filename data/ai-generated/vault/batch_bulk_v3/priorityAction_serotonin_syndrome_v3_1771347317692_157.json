The client was started on sertraline four weeks ago and took a dose of sumatriptan for a headache one hour before arrival. The client is agitated, confused, and diaphoretic. Which action should the nurse take **first**?",

        "correct": "The client's presentation of agitation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia (103.8°F), tachycardia, hypertension, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia after taking sertraline and sumatriptan is highly indicative of severe serotonin syndrome. Severe hyperthermia is a life-threatening complication that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ failure. The absolute priority is to address the most immediate threat to life, which is the dangerously high body temperature. Initiating rapid external cooling measures (e.g., cooling blankets, ice packs to axillae/groin, tepid water sponging) is the first action to prevent irreversible organ damage.",
        "incorrect": "While lorazepam, cyproheptadine, and labetalol may all be part of the treatment plan for serotonin syndrome, they are not the initial priority. Lorazepam is used to control agitation and myoclonus, which can help reduce heat production, but it does not cool the body as effectively as external measures. Labetalol addresses the symptomatic hypertension, but the hypertension is a result of autonomic instability; aggressive blood pressure management can be dangerous, and the core problem is the hyperthermia. Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist used as an antidote, but its administration is secondary to immediate life-saving stabilization measures like cooling and sedation.",

                "content": "This action is incorrect to perform first. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is essential for managing agitation and muscle rigidity in serotonin syndrome, which helps decrease heat production. However, with a temperature of 103.8°F (39.9°C), the client is already severely hyperthermic, and direct, rapid cooling is a more immediate life-saving priority to prevent imminent complications like rhabdomyolysis and organ damage.",

This level of heat can rapidly lead to seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and multi-organ failure.

While it is a key component of definitive treatment, its administration is not the first priority. The client must first be stabilized with supportive care, which includes addressing the life-threatening hyperthermia and agitation. Antidote administration follows initial stabilization.",

While severe hypertension needs management, it is secondary to the life-threatening hyperthermia. Furthermore, treating the blood pressure with a beta-blocker without addressing the underlying cause can be risky, as the autonomic instability can lead to sudden hypotension. The priority is to manage the cause and the most dangerous physiological consequence, which is the hyperthermia.",
