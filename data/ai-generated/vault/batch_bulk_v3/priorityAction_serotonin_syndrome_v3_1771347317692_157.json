    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system. The combination of sertraline (SSRI) and sumatriptan (triptan, which can also increase serotonin levels) increases the risk. The client's elevated temperature (39.9°C/103.8°F), tachycardia (132 bpm), hypertension (178/98 mmHg), diaphoresis, agitation, confusion, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and muscle rigidity are all indicative of this syndrome. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** Serotonin syndrome occurs when there is an overstimulation of serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, in the brainstem and spinal cord. This overstimulation leads to a cascade of effects, including autonomic instability (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension), neuromuscular abnormalities (myoclonus, hyperreflexia, rigidity), and altered mental status (agitation, confusion). Hyperthermia is a critical manifestation because elevated body temperature can cause cellular damage, protein denaturation, and ultimately, organ failure.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Severe hyperthermia in serotonin syndrome requires immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. Cooling measures should be initiated without delay.\n\nGiven the client's dangerously high temperature, the priority is to initiate external cooling measures immediately. This will help prevent further complications such as rhabdomyolysis, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ failure.",
    "incorrect": "While other interventions may be necessary, they are not the priority over addressing the life-threatening hyperthermia.\n\n*   **Lorazepam:** Addresses agitation and muscle rigidity, which contribute to heat production, but does not directly lower the body temperature as rapidly as external cooling.\n*   **Labetalol:** Manages hypertension, a symptom of autonomic instability. However, rapidly lowering blood pressure without addressing the underlying cause can be dangerous and may lead to hypotension. The hyperthermia is the more immediate threat.\n*   **Cyproheptadine:** A serotonin antagonist that can reverse the effects of serotonin syndrome. However, it is not the first-line treatment in the acute setting. Stabilization with supportive care, including cooling and sedation, is crucial before administering cyproheptadine.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Beta-blockers should be used with caution in serotonin syndrome, as they can potentially worsen autonomic instability if not carefully monitored.",
