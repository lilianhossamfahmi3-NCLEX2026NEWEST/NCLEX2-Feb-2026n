    "stem": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a known history of myasthenia gravis. The client reports 'feeling weaker than usual,' difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath that has worsened over the past 4 hours. On assessment, the nurse notes shallow respirations at a rate of 28/min, use of accessory muscles, and an SpO2 of 91% on room air. The healthcare provider is at the bedside. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag and drop the actions into the correct sequence from first to last.",

        "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes actions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework, addressing the most life-threatening condition first. The highest priority is a focused respiratory assessment to quantify the severity of respiratory compromise in this impending myasthenic crisis. This is immediately followed by establishing IV access to prepare for medication administration. The third step is to administer pyridostigmine, the medication that directly addresses the neuromuscular weakness. Anticipating further decline by preparing for intubation is the next crucial safety step. Finally, addressing the aspiration risk by making the client NPO is performed once the immediate life threats are being managed.",
        "incorrect": "An incorrect sequence would deprioritize the immediate life-threatening respiratory compromise. For example, making the client NPO or administering medication before a thorough respiratory assessment could lead to a delay in recognizing the need for intubation. Failing to establish IV access early would delay the administration of potentially life-saving medications. While all actions are appropriate, the sequence is critical to prevent respiratory arrest.",

The client's symptoms (tachypnea, accessory muscle use, low SpO2) strongly suggest impending respiratory failure, the primary cause of death in a myasthenic crisis.
