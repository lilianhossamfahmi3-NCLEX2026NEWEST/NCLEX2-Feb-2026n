  "stem": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a known history of myasthenia gravis. The client reports 'feeling weaker than usual,' difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath that has worsened over the past 4 hours. On assessment, the nurse notes shallow respirations at a rate of 28/min, use of accessory muscles, and an SpO2 of 91% on room air. The healthcare provider is at the bedside. The nurse should perform the following actions in which order? Drag and drop the actions into the correct sequence from first to last.",

    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes actions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework, addressing the most life-threatening condition first. The client is exhibiting signs of a myasthenic crisis, a medical emergency characterized by severe muscle weakness, including respiratory muscles. The highest priority is a focused respiratory assessment to quantify the severity of respiratory compromise. Vital capacity measurement helps determine the degree of respiratory muscle weakness and the need for ventilatory support. This is immediately followed by establishing IV access to prepare for medication administration and potential fluid resuscitation. The third step is to administer pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which increases acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction, improving muscle strength. Anticipating further decline by preparing for intubation is the next crucial safety step, ensuring immediate airway management if needed. Finally, addressing the aspiration risk by making the client NPO is performed once the immediate life threats are being managed. Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.",
    "incorrect": "An incorrect sequence would deprioritize the immediate life-threatening respiratory compromise. For example, making the client NPO or administering medication before a thorough respiratory assessment could lead to a delay in recognizing the need for intubation. Failing to establish IV access early would delay the administration of potentially life-saving medications. While all actions are appropriate, the sequence is critical to prevent respiratory arrest and potential hypoxic brain injury. Delaying respiratory assessment could lead to unrecognized respiratory failure.",

        "content": "Perform a focused respiratory assessment, including vital capacity. This is the first and most critical action. The client's symptoms (tachypnea, accessory muscle use, low SpO2) strongly suggest impending respiratory failure, the primary cause of death in a myasthenic crisis. Measuring vital capacity provides an objective measure of respiratory muscle strength and is a key indicator for the need for ventilatory support. A decreased vital capacity indicates significant respiratory muscle weakness, necessitating immediate intervention. Normal vital capacity is 65-75 mL/kg. A value less than 20 mL/kg indicates the need for intubation.",

After the initial rapid assessment confirms a crisis, establishing IV access is crucial for the rapid administration of medications (such as pyridostigmine, IV immunoglobulin, or corticosteroids) and fluids, which are essential for managing the crisis and providing hemodynamic support. Rapid IV access allows for bolus administration of medications and fluids as needed.",

Once the airway is being assessed and IV access is secured, administering the anticholinesterase medication is the next step. Pyridostigmine increases the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which will improve muscle strength, including the function of respiratory muscles. The typical dose of pyridostigmine is 30-60 mg orally every 3-6 hours. In a crisis, IV administration may be necessary.",

Proactively preparing intubation equipment at the bedside is a critical safety measure.

Having the equipment readily available saves valuable time in an emergency.",

The client's reported difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and generalized weakness place them at a very high risk for aspiration. Making the client NPO is an important safety measure to prevent this complication. However, it is prioritized after immediate life-saving respiratory and medication interventions have been initiated. Aspiration can lead to pneumonia and further respiratory compromise.",
