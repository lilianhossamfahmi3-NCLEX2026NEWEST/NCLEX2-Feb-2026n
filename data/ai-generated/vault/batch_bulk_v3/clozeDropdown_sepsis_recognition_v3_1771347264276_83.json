The client's pneumonia has triggered a widespread, systemic inflammation, evidenced by fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis (WBC 18.5). This systemic response is what causes vasodilation, capillary leak, and subsequent organ dysfunction."

The organ dysfunction is demonstrated by: hypotension (cardiovascular), acute confusion (central nervous system), tachypnea/hypoxemia (respiratory), and elevated creatinine indicating acute kidney injury.
