Initial assessment reveals an estimated TBSA of 40.5%. Singed nasal hairs and a hoarse voice were noted upon arrival. He is alert and oriented, reporting severe pain rated 9/10. Client's weight is 85 kg. His height is 178 cm. Past medical history is significant for GERD. He arrived in the ED at 10:45. Initial vital signs: HR 128, BP 102/68, RR 24, SpO2 93% on room air. Two large-bore IVs established."

Delaying resuscitation or calculating from the ED arrival time (10:45) can lead to inadequate initial fluid replacement and increased risk of hypovolemic shock. Accurate timing is crucial for effective resuscitation. Clinical Pearl: Document the exact time of injury meticulously.",

        "rationale": "This is correct. The Parkland formula uses the percentage of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burned as a key variable to estimate fluid needs (4 mL x %TBSA x weight in kg). TBSA represents the extent of tissue damage and subsequent fluid shifts. Underestimation of TBSA leads to under-resuscitation, while overestimation can cause fluid overload. Clinical Pearl: Use the Rule of Nines or Lund-Browder chart for accurate TBSA estimation.",

Weight directly influences the total fluid volume required to maintain adequate perfusion. Using an inaccurate weight will result in either under- or over-resuscitation. Clinical Pearl: Obtain an accurate weight as soon as possible, ideally before significant fluid shifts occur.",

        "rationale": "This is incorrect. The Parkland formula calculates fluid resuscitation from the *time of the burn injury* (10:00), not the time of arrival at the hospital (10:45). Using the arrival time would result in a dangerously accelerated infusion rate during the initial critical hours. This could lead to fluid overload and complications.",

Calculate the total 24-hour fluid requirement and administer half of the calculated volume within the first 8 hours from the time of the burn injury (1000). Monitor urine output, vital signs, and respiratory status closely. Consider early intubation due to potential inhalation injury."
