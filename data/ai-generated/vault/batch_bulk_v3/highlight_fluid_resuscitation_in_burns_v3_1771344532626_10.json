Initial assessment reveals an estimated TBSA of 40.5%. Singed nasal hairs and a hoarse voice were noted upon arrival. He is alert and oriented, reporting severe pain rated 9/10. Client's weight is 85 kg. His height is 178 cm. Past medical history is significant for GERD. He arrived in the ED at 10:45. Initial vital signs: HR 128, BP 102/68, RR 24, SpO2 93% on room air. Two large-bore IVs established."

The Parkland formula requires infusing the first half of the total 24-hour fluid volume over the first 8 hours from the time of the burn injury, not from the time of hospital arrival. Knowing the time of injury is critical for calculating the correct infusion rate."

These vital signs indicate hypovolemic and/or distributive shock and potential respiratory compromise, providing the rationale for why fluid resuscitation is needed.
