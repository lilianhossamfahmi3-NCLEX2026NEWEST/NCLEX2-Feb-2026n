  "stem": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder. The client was brought in by their spouse due to a 2-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and increasing confusion. The spouse reports the client has been taking ibuprofen for muscle aches. The client's vital signs are: T 37.1° C (98.8° F), HR 118/min, RR 20/min, BP 98/64 mmHg. The client is lethargic and has a coarse hand tremor. Laboratory results show a serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L (Therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L) and a serum sodium of 132 mEq/L (Normal: 135-145 mEq/L).",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of lithium toxicity, evidenced by confusion, coarse tremors, vomiting, diarrhea, and a significantly elevated serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Lithium, a mood stabilizer, is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, coupled with ibuprofen use (which impairs renal function and increases lithium levels), has likely led to decreased lithium clearance and subsequent toxicity. \n\nAdministering 0.9% sodium chloride IV is crucial to restore fluid volume and electrolyte balance. Lithium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules of the kidneys in competition with sodium. Increasing sodium levels promotes lithium excretion, helping to lower the serum lithium concentration. Initiating seizure precautions is essential due to the neurotoxic effects of lithium, which can manifest as seizures, especially at elevated levels. \n\nMonitoring neurological status is paramount to detect any deterioration, such as worsening confusion, ataxia, or seizure activity. Serial serum lithium levels are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and guide further treatment, potentially including hemodialysis in severe cases.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect condition choices do not fully account for the client's presentation and lab values. Serotonin syndrome lacks the history of serotonergic agent initiation/increase and presents with different neuromuscular findings. Acute gastroenteritis and hyponatremia are contributing factors, not the primary diagnosis. DKA is inconsistent with the client's presentation.\n\nIncorrect actions either worsen the situation or are not the priority. Furosemide promotes sodium loss, increasing lithium reabsorption and exacerbating toxicity. Activated charcoal is ineffective for lithium. Loperamide addresses a symptom, not the underlying cause.\n\nIncorrect monitoring parameters are less relevant to the immediate management of lithium toxicity. Urine specific gravity is a general hydration marker, while bowel sounds and blood glucose are not directly affected by lithium toxicity.",
