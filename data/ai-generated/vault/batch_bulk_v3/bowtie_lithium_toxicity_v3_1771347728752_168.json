The client was brought in by their spouse due to a 2-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and increasing confusion. The spouse reports the client has been taking ibuprofen for muscle aches. The client's vital signs are: T 37.1° C (98.8° F), HR 118/min, RR 20/min, BP 98/64 mmHg. The client is lethargic and has a coarse hand tremor. Laboratory results show a serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L (Therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L) and a serum sodium of 132 mEq/L (Normal: 135-145 mEq/L).",

This is confirmed by the elevated serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L. The priority actions are to restore fluid volume and electrolyte balance with 0.9% sodium chloride to promote renal excretion of lithium and to implement seizure precautions due to the high risk of CNS excitability and seizures in severe toxicity. Monitoring neurological status is critical to detect deterioration, and tracking the serum lithium level is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.",

Acute Gastroenteritis and Hyponatremia are contributing factors or consequences, not the primary underlying life-threatening condition. Inappropriate actions include administering furosemide (which can worsen sodium depletion and toxicity), activated charcoal (which does not bind lithium), or loperamide (which is not a priority). Monitoring parameters like bowel sounds or urine specific gravity are secondary to the critical need to assess for neurotoxicity and the response to treatment via direct lithium level measurement.",
