Pre-dialysis potassium was 5.9 mEq/L. Fluid restriction of 1500 mL/24 hours is in place.\n**ASSESSMENT:** BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96% on room air. Small amount of serosanguineous drainage from venous AV fistula site. 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities. Alert and oriented x4.\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Hold lisinopril due to potential post-dialysis hypotension. Continue to monitor AV fistula site for bleeding and assess patency. Assist with position changes to prevent orthostatic hypotension. Notify provider if bleeding from AV fistula increases significantly or BP continues to decrease below 100/60 mmHg."

A bruit is a whooshing sound heard with a stethoscope, and a thrill is a palpable vibration. These indicate adequate blood flow through the fistula. Absence of either can indicate a clot or stenosis, compromising the access for future dialysis. Stenosis reduces blood flow, increasing the risk of thrombosis and access failure.",

The client's BP (108/68 mmHg) and reported dizziness suggest potential hypotension. Administering lisinopril could exacerbate this, leading to symptomatic hypotension and potential falls. Holding the medication prevents further BP reduction until the client's volume status stabilizes. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone release, which can lower BP further after fluid removal.",

Administering potassium chloride post-dialysis could lead to dangerous hyperkalemia, causing cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potentially cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia affects the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells, leading to impaired repolarization and potentially fatal arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation.",

Applying light, steady pressure is the initial intervention to promote hemostasis and prevent hematoma formation. Pressure should be applied for several minutes until bleeding stops. Avoid occlusive dressings that could compromise blood flow through the fistula. Direct pressure activates the coagulation cascade, leading to platelet aggregation and fibrin clot formation at the puncture site.",

Encouraging a large fluid bolus violates this restriction and counteracts the purpose of dialysis, which is to remove excess fluid. This could lead to fluid overload, causing pulmonary edema, hypertension, and increased cardiac workload. Fluid overload increases hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, leading to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space and pulmonary alveoli.",

Assisting the client to change positions slowly allows the cardiovascular system time to compensate for positional changes, preventing a sudden drop in blood pressure and reducing the risk of falls. Orthostatic hypotension occurs due to decreased venous return and inadequate baroreceptor response upon standing, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Orthostatic hypotension is common post-dialysis. Instruct clients to change positions slowly and dangle their legs before standing to minimize fall risk."
