    "question": "A 68-year-old client with small cell lung cancer is admitted with lethargy and confusion. Vital signs are stable. Assessment reveals moist mucous membranes and no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show: serum sodium 116 mEq/L (116 mmol/L), serum osmolality 258 mOsm/kg H2O, and urine osmolality 650 mOsm/kg H2O. The healthcare provider has prescribed several interventions for suspected Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Which intervention should the nurse implement first?",

        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation of lethargy and confusion, combined with a serum sodium level of 116 mEq/L, indicates severe, symptomatic hyponatremia. This condition causes cerebral edema and is a medical emergency that can rapidly progress to seizures, coma, and death. The priority intervention is to administer hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride) to slowly increase the serum sodium concentration. This creates an osmotic gradient that pulls excess fluid out of the brain cells, reducing cerebral edema and preventing further neurological deterioration.",
        "incorrect": "While other interventions are used in SIADH management, they are not the priority in this acute, life-threatening situation. Fluid restriction is a primary treatment but works too slowly to reverse acute neurological symptoms. Furosemide can worsen hyponatremia if administered without saline replacement. Tolvaptan is not indicated for an acute emergency due to its slower onset of action.",
