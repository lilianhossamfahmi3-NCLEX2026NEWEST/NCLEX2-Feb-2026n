  "question": "A 68-year-old client with small cell lung cancer is admitted with lethargy and confusion. Vital signs are stable. Assessment reveals moist mucous membranes and no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show: serum sodium 116 mEq/L (116 mmol/L), serum osmolality 258 mOsm/kg H2O, and urine osmolality 650 mOsm/kg H2O. The healthcare provider has prescribed several interventions for suspected Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Which intervention should the nurse implement first?",

    "correct": "The client presents with symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium 116 mEq/L) secondary to SIADH, evidenced by lethargy and confusion. This indicates cerebral edema due to the osmotic shift of water into brain cells. Administering 3% sodium chloride (hypertonic saline) is the priority. Hypertonic saline increases serum osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water out of the brain cells, reducing cerebral edema and preventing neurological deterioration. The infusion must be carefully monitored to avoid rapid correction, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Frequent neurological assessments and serum sodium level monitoring are crucial. ClinicalPearl: Rapid correction of hyponatremia (>8 mEq/L in 24 hours) can cause irreversible neurological damage.",
    "incorrect": "Fluid restriction is a component of SIADH management but is not the initial priority in severe, symptomatic hyponatremia. It addresses the underlying fluid overload but acts too slowly to reverse acute neurological symptoms. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, promotes sodium and water excretion, which can worsen hyponatremia if administered without concurrent hypertonic saline. This can exacerbate cerebral edema and neurological symptoms. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist, is used for chronic SIADH or when fluid restriction is ineffective. Its onset of action is slower than hypertonic saline, making it unsuitable for acute neurological emergencies. Furthermore, rapid correction with tolvaptan can also lead to ODS.",
