            "opt-1a": "Correct. Cardiogenic shock is a state of severe heart failure where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The client's hypotension (BP 84/58 mmHg), compensatory tachycardia (HR 118/min), and pulmonary congestion (crackles, SpO2 90%) are classic signs of this life-threatening post-MI complication.",
            "opt-1b": "Incorrect. Cardiac tamponade is characterized by Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distention (JVD), and muffled heart sounds. While hypotension is present, the other key findings are absent, and the presence of lung crackles makes tamponade less likely.",
            "opt-1c": "Incorrect. While the client has pulmonary edema (crackles, shortness of breath), 'flash pulmonary edema' is a symptom or a rapid onset condition, not the overarching syndrome. Cardiogenic shock is the underlying cause of the pulmonary edema, hypotension, and other signs of hypoperfusion.",
            "opt-1d": "Incorrect. Re-infarction could lead to cardiogenic shock, but it is typically associated with recurrent ischemic chest pain and new EKG changes. The cluster of hemodynamic instability and pulmonary congestion points more directly to the syndrome of cardiogenic shock as the primary analysis."

        "BLANK-2": {
            "opt-2a": "Correct. Cool, clammy skin results from peripheral vasoconstriction as the body shunts blood from the extremities to vital organs. Decreased urine output (oliguria, 20 mL/hr) indicates reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Both are hallmark signs of impaired end-organ perfusion due to shock.",
            "opt-2b": "Incorrect. A systemic inflammatory response is more characteristic of sepsis or a post-cardiac surgery syndrome (Dressler's syndrome). While an MI involves inflammation, it does not directly explain the acute signs of peripheral shutdown and oliguria.",
            "opt-2c": "Incorrect. This clinical presentation represents a severe and life-threatening complication. It is never an expected response after a successful PCI, which is intended to improve cardiac function.",
            "opt-2d": "Incorrect. Fluid volume deficit would cause hypotension and tachycardia, but it would not typically cause pulmonary crackles. The presence of crackles suggests fluid backing up into the lungs due to pump failure, not a lack of total body volume."
        },
        "BLANK-3": {
            "opt-3a": "Correct. Decreased cardiac output is the central pathophysiological problem in cardiogenic shock. The heart's inability to pump effectively is the root cause of the hypotension, pulmonary congestion, and impaired end-organ perfusion. All interventions will be aimed at improving cardiac output.",
            "opt-3b": "Incorrect. Impaired gas exchange, evidenced by the low SpO2 and crackles, is a critical problem. However, it is a consequence of the decreased cardiac output leading to pulmonary edema. The priority is to treat the cause (the failing pump), which will in turn improve gas exchange.",
            "opt-3c": "Incorrect. Acute kidney injury is a potential complication resulting from prolonged renal hypoperfusion (indicated by the low urine output). It is a consequence of the decreased cardiac output, not the primary, immediate problem that must be addressed to save the client's life.",
            "opt-3d": "Incorrect. The client's anxiety is a valid concern and is likely caused by hypoxia and the feeling of impending doom associated with severe physiological distress. However, it is a symptom of the underlying life-threatening hemodynamic collapse, which is the absolute priority."
