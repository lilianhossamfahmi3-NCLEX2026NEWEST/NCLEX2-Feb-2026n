        "rationale": "Correct. Cardiogenic shock is a critical condition where the heart's ability to pump blood is severely compromised, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. Following an MI, damage to the myocardium can significantly reduce contractility. The client's hypotension (BP 84/58 mmHg) reflects the heart's inability to maintain adequate blood pressure. The compensatory tachycardia (HR 118/min) is the body's attempt to increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate. Pulmonary congestion, indicated by crackles and SpO2 of 90%, occurs because the weakened heart cannot effectively pump blood forward, leading to backflow into the pulmonary circulation. This cascade of events is the hallmark of cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening complication requiring immediate intervention to support cardiac function and improve perfusion.",

These findings are hallmark signs of impaired end-organ perfusion due to the decreased cardiac output in cardiogenic shock.
