    "stem": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 28-year-old client brought in by police for erratic behavior. The client is diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of paranoid schizophrenia. The client is pacing, yelling 'They're trying to poison me! The voices are telling me to fight back!' and is clenching their fists. The client has a PRN prescription for olanzapine 10 mg intramuscular (IM) for acute agitation. Which actions should the nurse take to ensure immediate safety for the client and staff? Select all that apply.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The correct interventions focus on de-escalation, environmental management, pharmacological treatment, and ensuring the safety of both the client and healthcare personnel. Reducing stimuli helps decrease the client's sensory overload. Using calm, clear communication can de-escalate the situation without being confrontational. Administering a prescribed antipsychotic is necessary to manage the acute psychosis and agitation. Maintaining a safe physical distance and ensuring an exit strategy are crucial for staff safety when dealing with a potentially violent client.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options are either non-therapeutic, premature, or violate the principle of using the least restrictive intervention. Arguing with a client's delusion increases agitation and destroys trust. Applying restraints is a last resort and should not be the immediate action. Forcing milieu therapy is inappropriate for a client experiencing acute psychosis, as it would be overstimulating and ineffective.",

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. Arguing with a client's fixed delusions or attempting to reason them out of a hallucination is non-therapeutic. This approach can increase the client's anxiety, agitation, and mistrust of the nurse, as it invalidates their perceived reality."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is correct. Clients experiencing an acute psychotic episode are often hypersensitive to external stimuli (lights, sounds, people). Moving the client to a quiet, private room minimizes sensory input, which can help decrease agitation and anxiety."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is incorrect. The principle of least restrictive intervention must be followed. While the client is agitated, less restrictive measures like verbal de-escalation, reducing stimuli, and offering PRN medication should be attempted first. Restraints are a last resort for imminent, uncontrollable danger to self or others."

                "explanation": "This is correct. This verbal de-escalation technique helps to avoid overwhelming the client, who may have difficulty processing complex information due to their thought disorder. A calm, non-threatening tone can help build trust and reduce paranoia and agitation."

                "explanation": "This is correct. The client is exhibiting signs of acute agitation and psychosis (pacing, yelling, clenched fists) that warrant pharmacological intervention. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic effective in managing these symptoms, and the IM route provides rapid onset of action."

                "explanation": "This is correct. The client's command hallucinations ('fight back') and aggressive posturing (clenched fists) indicate a risk for violence. The nurse must prioritize staff safety by maintaining personal space (at least an arm's length) and ensuring they are not cornered in the room."
