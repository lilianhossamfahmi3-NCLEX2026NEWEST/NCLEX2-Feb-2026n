Ventilator settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O, Tidal Volume (Vt) 420 mL (PBW 70 kg), RR 18/min. Provider notified of results and new orders received to increase FiO2 to 80% and PEEP to 15 cm H2O. RR increased to 22/min. \n\n1100: Reassessment one hour after ventilator changes. ABG results: pH of 7.25, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2 of 55 mmHg. Current ventilator settings are FiO2 80% and PEEP of 15 cm H2O, with a tidal volume is 420 mL. The most recent plateau pressure is 32 cm H2O. Vital signs: HR 125 bpm, Blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg (MAP 63), SpO2 88%.",

        "correct": "The combination of refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 55 mmHg despite 80% FiO2), elevated plateau pressure (>30 cm H2O), and hemodynamic instability (BP 88/50 mmHg) are critical indicators that the client's ARDS is worsening and that the current ventilator strategy may be causing harm (barotrauma, decreased cardiac output). These findings require immediate intervention to prevent further decompensation.",
        "incorrect": "The other findings, while important, are either expected consequences of a lung-protective ventilation strategy or are the interventions themselves, not the critical patient response. Permissive hypercapnia allows for a lower pH (like 7.25) and higher PaCO2 to protect the lungs. The PEEP and tidal volume are therapeutic settings, not assessment findings indicating deterioration.",

This allows the PaCO2 to rise and the pH to fall. A pH above 7.20 is generally considered acceptable in this context and does not, by itself, indicate a critical worsening that requires immediate reporting.",

It is likely a complication of the high intrathoracic pressure caused by the increased PEEP (15 cm H2O), which can decrease venous return and cardiac output.
