The first and most critical nursing action is to rapidly assess the chest tube system for any external problems, such as kinks, loose connections, or dislodgement, as these can mimic a large internal leak and are quickly correctable. If the system is patent, the cause is internal. The development of a large air leak places the client at high risk for a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening complication. Therefore, monitoring for signs of hemodynamic compromise (hypotension, tachycardia) and worsening air trapping (progression of subcutaneous emphysema) is essential to detect this deterioration early.",

Conditions like hemorrhage, PE, or ARDS do not align with the classic presentation of a massive air leak with subcutaneous emphysema.",
