    "correct": "The client's presentation strongly suggests Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). Fever (38.6°C/101.5°F), abdominal tenderness, and leukocytosis (WBC 15,000/mm³) are cardinal signs. The hypotension (90/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (112 bpm) indicate a systemic inflammatory response, potentially progressing to septic shock. SBP occurs when ascitic fluid becomes infected, often by translocation of bacteria from the gut due to impaired intestinal barrier function in cirrhosis. This leads to peritonitis, systemic inflammation, and potential sepsis. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent rapid deterioration and multi-organ failure. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to confirm the diagnosis, followed by empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. This is the priority because untreated SBP has a high mortality rate.",
    "incorrect": "While Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS), and hypovolemia are present, they are secondary to the likely SBP. HE (confusion, asterixis, elevated ammonia) is often precipitated by infection. HRS (elevated creatinine) is a consequence of decreased renal perfusion due to systemic inflammation and hypotension from SBP. Hypovolemia, while contributing to hypotension, is exacerbated by the vasodilation associated with sepsis. Addressing the underlying SBP will improve these secondary conditions. Delaying treatment for SBP to address these other issues will worsen the patient's overall condition and prognosis.",

      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is present, indicated by disorientation, asterixis, and elevated ammonia levels. HE results from the liver's inability to detoxify ammonia, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream and subsequent neurological dysfunction. While important to manage, it's often triggered by infections like SBP. Treating the underlying infection is the priority.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "The elevated creatinine (1.8 mg/dL) raises concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a form of acute kidney injury specific to patients with advanced liver disease. HRS is characterized by renal vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration rate due to splanchnic vasodilation and decreased effective circulating volume. However, in this case, it's likely secondary to sepsis-induced acute kidney injury from SBP. Treating the SBP is the priority.",
        "isCorrect": false

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "Correct. The combination of fever, abdominal tenderness, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in a patient with ascites is highly suggestive of SBP. The accompanying hypotension and tachycardia indicate progression to sepsis, a life-threatening complication requiring immediate antibiotic administration. SBP is a common and serious complication of cirrhosis, resulting from bacterial translocation into the ascitic fluid.",

        "label": "D",
        "content": "Hypotension and tachycardia could be partly attributed to intravascular hypovolemia from third-spacing of fluid into the abdomen (ascites). However, in the presence of fever and a high WBC count, these signs are more likely due to distributive shock from sepsis caused by SBP. While fluid resuscitation is important, the primary intervention is to treat the infection.",
