        "correct": "The client's presentation of fever (101.5°F), abdominal tenderness, and leukocytosis (WBC 15,000/mm³) are classic signs of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP), a life-threatening infection of the ascitic fluid. The associated hypotension (90/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (112 bpm) are indicative of developing sepsis. SBP is a medical emergency that requires immediate diagnostic paracentesis and empiric antibiotic therapy to prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure. This condition represents the most immediate threat to the client's life.",
        "incorrect": "While the client is exhibiting signs of Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS), and hypovolemia, these are often precipitated or exacerbated by SBP. HE, indicated by confusion and asterixis, is frequently triggered by infection. The elevated creatinine suggests acute kidney injury, which in this context is likely due to the septic process affecting renal perfusion, a precursor to HRS. The hypotension and tachycardia, while suggesting hypovolemia, are more acutely explained by the systemic inflammatory response and vasodilation of sepsis (distributive shock). Therefore, treating the underlying infection (SBP) is the priority intervention that will address the root cause of the client's rapid deterioration.",
