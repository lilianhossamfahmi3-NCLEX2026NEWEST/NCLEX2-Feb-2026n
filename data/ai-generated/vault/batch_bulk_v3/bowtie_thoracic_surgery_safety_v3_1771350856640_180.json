    "condition": {
      "C1": "Incorrect. (-)\nHemorrhage can cause tachycardia and hypotension, but the respiratory distress, crepitus, and continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber are more indicative of an air leak. Post-lobectomy hemorrhage would manifest as significant bloody chest tube drainage.",
      "C2": "Correct. (+)\nContinuous, vigorous bubbling in the water seal chamber indicates a significant air leak, likely from the surgical site or lung tissue. Crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema) confirms air escaping into the tissues. The sharp chest pain and respiratory distress are due to the pneumothorax caused by the air leak. High intrathoracic pressure from the air leak compromises venous return, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.",
      "C3": "Incorrect. (-)\nPulmonary embolism (PE) can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, but it wouldn't explain the chest tube findings (bubbling) or crepitus. PE results from a blood clot obstructing pulmonary blood flow, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia.",
      "C4": "Incorrect. (-)\nAtelectasis (lung collapse) can cause diminished breath sounds and low SpO2, but not typically sharp pain or continuous bubbling in the chest tube. Atelectasis occurs due to alveolar collapse, often from inadequate deep breathing or mucus plugging.",
      "C5": "Incorrect. (-)\nSurgical site infections typically develop later (days) and present with fever, purulent drainage, and localized inflammation. They wouldn't cause the acute respiratory distress and chest tube findings observed here."
    },
    "actions": {
      "A1": "Incorrect. (-)\nWhile the client reports pain, addressing the underlying respiratory compromise is the priority. Opioids can depress respiratory drive, worsening the situation. ClinicalPearl: Address the cause, not just the symptom, especially in respiratory distress.",
      "A2": "Incorrect. (-)\nClamping the chest tube in the presence of an air leak is contraindicated. It can cause a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural space, compressing the heart and lungs. ClinicalPearl: Never clamp a chest tube with an active air leak unless specifically ordered by a provider in anticipation of removal.",
      "A3": "Correct. (+)\nHigh-Fowler's position promotes lung expansion by decreasing pressure on the diaphragm and increasing thoracic volume. This improves ventilation and oxygenation, alleviating shortness of breath.",
      "A4": "Correct. (+)\nChecking chest tube connections is crucial to identify and correct the source of the air leak. A loose connection can allow atmospheric air to enter the system, mimicking or exacerbating an internal air leak.",
      "A5": "Incorrect. (-)\nWhile incentive spirometry is beneficial post-lobectomy to prevent atelectasis, it's not the immediate priority in acute respiratory distress. The client is already struggling to breathe, and forcing deep breaths could worsen the air leak and pain."
    },
    "parameters": {
      "P1": "Correct. (+)\nTracheal deviation is a late sign of tension pneumothorax, indicating significant pressure buildup in the chest cavity. The trachea will deviate away from the affected side. This requires immediate intervention.",
      "P2": "Incorrect. (-)\nUrine output reflects renal perfusion and fluid balance, but it's not directly related to the acute respiratory problem of an air leak.",
      "P3": "Correct. (+)\nOxygen saturation (SpO2) directly reflects the client's oxygenation status. Monitoring SpO2 helps assess the severity of the respiratory compromise and the effectiveness of interventions. A decreasing SpO2 indicates worsening gas exchange.",
      "P4": "Incorrect. (-)\nIncisional drainage is important for monitoring infection and bleeding, but it doesn't provide information about the air leak or respiratory function.",
      "P5": "Incorrect. (-)\nBowel sounds are irrelevant to the acute respiratory problem. They are important for assessing gastrointestinal function, but not for a thoracic complication."
