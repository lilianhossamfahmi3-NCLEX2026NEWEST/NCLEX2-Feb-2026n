            "C1": "Incorrect. While tachycardia and hypotension can occur with hemorrhage, the primary signs here are respiratory. There is no mention of excessive bloody output in the chest tube, which would be the key indicator of postoperative hemorrhage from the thoracic cavity.",
            "C2": "Correct. The combination of sudden respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus), and especially the continuous, vigorous bubbling in the water seal chamber are classic signs of a large, persistent air leak from the lung parenchyma or suture line.",
            "C3": "Incorrect. A pulmonary embolism presents with similar symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia), but it would not explain the findings specific to the chest tube system (vigorous bubbling) or the subcutaneous emphysema.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. Atelectasis would present with diminished breath sounds and a low SpO2, but it typically does not cause sharp pain, significant tachycardia, or continuous vigorous bubbling in the water seal chamber. Intermittent bubbling with coughing might be seen, but not continuous.",
            "C5": "Incorrect. A surgical site infection would not develop this acutely (12 hours post-op) and would be characterized by fever, purulent drainage, and erythema, none of which are present."
        },
        "actions": {
            "A1": "Incorrect. While the client is in pain, the pain is a symptom of a significant respiratory complication. The priority is to address the underlying cause of respiratory distress, not to sedate the client with an opioid, which could further depress respirations.",
            "A2": "Incorrect. Clamping a chest tube in the presence of an air leak is contraindicated and extremely dangerous. It would block the escape of air, leading to a rapid accumulation of air in the pleural space and causing a tension pneumothorax, which is a medical emergency.",
            "A3": "Correct. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position facilitates lung expansion and helps decrease the work of breathing, providing immediate symptomatic relief while further interventions are initiated.",
            "A4": "Correct. The first step when observing a new or significant air leak is to quickly assess the drainage system from the client to the unit, looking for loose connections or tubing disconnections that could be introducing atmospheric air into the system.",
            "A5": "Incorrect. The incentive spirometer is used to prevent atelectasis. Asking a client in acute respiratory distress to perform this maneuver is inappropriate and would exacerbate their dyspnea and anxiety."
        },
        "parameters": {
            "P1": "Correct. The nurse must monitor for tracheal deviation. A shift of the trachea away from the affected side is a late and critical sign that the air leak has progressed to a life-threatening tension pneumothorax, which requires immediate intervention.",
            "P2": "Incorrect. While urine output is an important indicator of perfusion and overall fluid status, it is not a primary, direct parameter for monitoring the progression or resolution of an acute respiratory complication like an air leak.",
            "P3": "Correct. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a direct, non-invasive measurement of the client's oxygenation status. A declining SpO2 would indicate worsening gas exchange and the severity of the respiratory compromise caused by the air leak.",
            "P4": "Incorrect. Monitoring incisional drainage is important for assessing bleeding and infection, but it does not provide information about the status of an internal air leak or the client's respiratory function.",
            "P5": "Incorrect. Bowel sounds are a key part of an abdominal assessment and are important postoperatively to monitor for ileus, but they are irrelevant to monitoring the status of an acute thoracic complication."
