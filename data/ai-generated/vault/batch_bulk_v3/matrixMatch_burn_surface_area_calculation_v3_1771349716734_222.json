    "correct": "The correct calculation of the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) for fluid resuscitation is based on the Rule of Nines for adults and includes only partial-thickness and full-thickness burns. Superficial burns are excluded because they do not cause significant fluid shifts. The anterior trunk is 18%, the entire right arm is 9%, and the posterior aspect of the left leg is 9%. The face has a superficial burn, so it contributes 0% to the TBSA calculation. Therefore, the total TBSA is 18% + 9% + 9% + 0% = 36%.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Partial- and full-thickness burns damage the epidermis and dermis, disrupting the skin's barrier function. This leads to increased capillary permeability, causing a massive fluid shift from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. This fluid loss results in hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, and potential organ damage if not adequately addressed with fluid resuscitation. Superficial burns, however, only affect the epidermis, leaving the capillary beds intact and preventing significant fluid shifts.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect calculations may result from including the superficial burn on the face (which would add 4.5%), miscalculating the percentage for a body part (e.g., assigning 4.5% to an entire arm or 18% to a leg), or confusing anterior and posterior surfaces. Only partial- and full-thickness burns are used to calculate fluid resuscitation needs because they involve significant fluid shifts due to increased capillary permeability, unlike superficial burns.\n\n**Pathophysiology Rationale:** Including superficial burns in the TBSA calculation would lead to overestimation of fluid requirements. Over-resuscitation can result in complications such as pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and abdominal compartment syndrome. Conversely, underestimating the TBSA can lead to inadequate fluid resuscitation, resulting in hypovolemic shock, acute kidney injury, and multi-organ dysfunction. Accurate TBSA calculation is crucial for guiding appropriate fluid management and preventing these life-threatening complications.",
