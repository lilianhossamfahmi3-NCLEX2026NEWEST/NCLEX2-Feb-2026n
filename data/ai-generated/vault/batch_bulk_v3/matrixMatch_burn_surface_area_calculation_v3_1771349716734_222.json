Superficial burns are excluded. The anterior trunk is 18%, the entire right arm is 9%, and the posterior aspect of the left leg is 9%. The face has a superficial burn, so it contributes 0% to the TBSA calculation. Therefore, the total TBSA is 18% + 9% + 9% + 0% = 36%.",

Only partial- and full-thickness burns are used to calculate fluid resuscitation needs because they involve significant fluid shifts, unlike superficial burns.",
