  "question": "A nurse in a rehabilitation unit is caring for a 28-year-old client with a T5 spinal cord injury. The client suddenly shouts, 'My head is pounding, I feel like it's going to explode!' The nurse observes that the client's face is flushed and they are diaphoretic above the level of the injury. Vital signs are: Blood Pressure 202/110 mmHg, Heart Rate 48/min, Respiratory Rate 22/min. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

    {
      "optionId": "opt_01",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Placing the client supine increases venous return, further elevating blood pressure and increasing the risk of stroke or seizure. Autonomic dysreflexia causes massive vasoconstriction below the level of the lesion. Increasing venous return exacerbates the hypertension.",
      "pathophysiology": "Autonomic dysreflexia is characterized by an exaggerated sympathetic response to stimuli below the level of the spinal cord injury. In a supine position, venous return increases, leading to further elevation of blood pressure due to the inability of the parasympathetic nervous system to regulate the response below the level of injury."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_02",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Elevating the head of the bed to 90 degrees (high-Fowler's position) promotes orthostatic hypotension, which helps to immediately lower blood pressure and reduce intracranial pressure. This is a priority intervention to decrease the risk of stroke.",
      "pathophysiology": "Elevating the head of the bed causes blood to pool in the lower extremities, decreasing venous return to the heart and subsequently lowering blood pressure. This counteracts the excessive vasoconstriction occurring in autonomic dysreflexia."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_03",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The severe headache is a symptom of the hypertensive crisis, not the cause. Administering an opioid will mask the primary symptom without addressing the underlying life-threatening condition and will delay essential treatment. The priority is to lower the blood pressure and identify the cause.",
      "pathophysiology": "Opioids do not address the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia, which is an exaggerated sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus. Masking the pain without treating the hypertension can lead to severe complications such as stroke or seizure."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_04",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The most common cause of autonomic dysreflexia is a noxious stimulus below the level of injury, with bladder distention being the primary culprit. The nurse must promptly assess for and relieve any bladder issues, such as kinks in the catheter or bladder spasms.",
      "pathophysiology": "Bladder distention triggers a cascade of sympathetic nervous system activation, leading to vasoconstriction and a rapid increase in blood pressure. The spinal cord injury prevents the brain from receiving and processing these signals normally, resulting in an uncontrolled hypertensive response."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_05",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Tight clothing, abdominal binders, or compression stockings can act as a noxious stimulus. Removing any restrictive items is a crucial step in eliminating the trigger for the hypertensive crisis.",
      "pathophysiology": "Constrictive clothing can act as a noxious stimulus, triggering the same sympathetic response as bladder distention. Removing the stimulus helps to interrupt the cycle of vasoconstriction and hypertension."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_06",
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect as a priority. While it may provide minor comfort for diaphoresis, it is a low-priority intervention that does not address the life-threatening hypertension, which is the root cause of the client's symptoms. Focus should be on lowering BP and finding the cause.",
      "pathophysiology": "Applying a cool compress does not address the underlying cause of autonomic dysreflexia or directly lower blood pressure. It provides symptomatic relief but does not prevent the potential complications of severe hypertension."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "opt_07",
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. If the client's blood pressure does not decrease after non-pharmacological interventions (like sitting upright and removing the stimulus), medication is required. The nurse should anticipate and prepare to administer a prescribed rapid-acting antihypertensive (e.g., nifedipine, nitroglycerin) per protocol to prevent severe complications.",
      "pathophysiology": "Rapid-acting antihypertensives are used to quickly lower blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage. These medications work by dilating blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart, counteracting the excessive vasoconstriction caused by autonomic dysreflexia."

  "clinicalPearls": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent stroke, seizure, or death. Remember the key interventions: elevate head of bed, identify and remove the noxious stimulus, and administer antihypertensives as needed. Educate clients with spinal cord injuries and their families about the signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and preventive measures.",
