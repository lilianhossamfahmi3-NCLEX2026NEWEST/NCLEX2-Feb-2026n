        "correct": "The nurse should immediately follow up on the clear fluid leaking from the sac, the infant's low temperature, the tense and full fontanel, and the irritability upon movement. Leakage of clear fluid indicates a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which creates a direct portal of entry for bacteria, placing the infant at extremely high risk for meningitis. The temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F) indicates hypothermia, which increases metabolic demand and oxygen consumption, and can lead to hypoglycemia and respiratory distress. A tense, full fontanel and irritability are classic signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), a common complication due to associated hydrocephalus. These findings are urgent and require immediate notification of the healthcare provider.",
        "incorrect": "Prone positioning, a sterile saline-soaked dressing over the sac, flaccid lower extremities, and urinary catheter drainage are all expected findings and represent appropriate management for an infant with an unrepaired myelomeningocele. Prone positioning prevents pressure on the sac. The sterile dressing protects the exposed neural tissue and prevents it from drying out. Flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities is an expected neurological deficit due to the spinal cord malformation. An indwelling catheter is necessary for managing the expected neurogenic bladder. While these require ongoing monitoring, they are not acute changes requiring immediate follow-up.",
