    "stem": "A nurse is caring for a 38-year-old client with a T5 spinal cord injury who activated the call light. The client reports a 'severe, pounding headache' and appears flushed and diaphoretic on the forehead and neck. The vital signs are: blood pressure 200/110 mmHg, heart rate 48/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F). The nurse observes piloerection on the client's lower extremities.",
    "prompt": "The nurse recognizes these findings are consistent with autonomic dysreflexia. Complete the following sentence to outline the plan of care. The nurse's priority action is to first __BLANK_1__, followed by immediately assessing for a __BLANK_2__. To manage the severe hypertension, the nurse should anticipate administering __BLANK_3__. The nurse understands that the bradycardia is a compensatory response mediated by the __BLANK_4__.",

                "rationale": "This is correct. The most common causes (over 85%) of autonomic dysreflexia are a distended bladder (e.g., kinked catheter) or fecal impaction. This should be the first area the nurse assesses after repositioning the client."

                "rationale": "This is correct. The extreme hypertension stimulates baroreceptors, which in turn activate parasympathetic outflow via the vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X). This stimulation causes the profound bradycardia seen in AD as the body attempts to counteract the hypertension."

                "rationale": "Incorrect. The sympathetic nervous system is what is causing the problem. Uncontrolled sympathetic discharge below the level of injury leads to vasoconstriction and hypertension. The bradycardia is a parasympathetic (vagal) response to this."
