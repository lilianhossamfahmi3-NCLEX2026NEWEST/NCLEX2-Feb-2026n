    "questionText": "A nurse in the emergency department is assessing a 45-year-old client with a history of major depressive disorder and migraine headaches. The client's partner reports the client seemed 'very confused and jittery' this morning after taking a new medication for a severe migraine. The client is currently taking escitalopram daily. Based on the assessment data provided, which findings should the nurse interpret as being most consistent with serotonin syndrome? Select all that apply.",

Muscle flaccidity (decreased muscle tone) and bradypnea (slow breathing) are contrary to the expected findings of hypertonia (rigidity), hyperreflexia, and tachypnea. These findings might be more indicative of sedative or opioid overdose."

            "rationale": "Correct. Altered mental status, including agitation, confusion, restlessness, and anxiety, is a core component of the clinical triad for serotonin syndrome. It results from the overstimulation of serotonin receptors in the central nervous system."

This manifests as tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm) and hypertension, as seen in the client's vital signs (HR 128, BP 172/98). This is due to the widespread effects of excess serotonin on the autonomic nervous system."

It is often accompanied by fever (hyperthermia), as noted in the client's temperature of 38.6° C. This is a critical finding that helps differentiate it from conditions like anticholinergic toxicity, which typically causes dry skin."

In serotonin syndrome, the gastrointestinal system is often hyperactive (diarrhea, hyperactive bowel sounds), and the client is diaphoretic (sweaty), not dry."
