        "Client reports a sudden feeling of apprehension and states, 'my throat feels like it's closing.'",
        "Skin is warm and flushed with a diffuse, raised, erythematous rash on the chest and back.",
        "Audible inspiratory stridor is noted without auscultation.",
        "Vital signs: Blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg, heart rate is 128/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, SpO2 is 94% on room air, and temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F)."
    ],
    "feedback": "The client is exhibiting signs of anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction. The priority is to recognize cues indicating airway compromise (stridor, throat closing), circulatory collapse (hypotension, tachycardia), and widespread histamine release (rash). These findings require immediate intervention, including stopping the offending agent and administering epinephrine.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
        {
            "key": "Client reports a sudden feeling of apprehension and states, 'my throat feels like it's closing.'",
            "value": "Correct. This subjective report is a critical indicator of laryngeal edema and impending airway obstruction. The feeling of apprehension or 'impending doom' is also a classic early symptom of anaphylaxis. This finding signals a life-threatening emergency."
        },
        {
            "key": "Wife is at the bedside and appears anxious.",
            "value": "Incorrect. The family member's emotional state is not a direct clinical indicator of the client's physiological condition. While important for holistic care, it is not a priority finding that requires immediate clinical intervention for the client."
        },
        {
            "key": "Skin is warm and flushed with a diffuse, raised, erythematous rash on the chest and back.",
            "value": "Correct. This describes urticaria (hives), a classic cutaneous manifestation of a systemic allergic reaction. It is caused by widespread histamine release leading to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability."
        },
        {
            "key": "Audible inspiratory stridor is noted without auscultation.",
            "value": "Correct. Stridor is a high-pitched, harsh sound caused by turbulent airflow through a narrowed upper airway. Audible stridor is an ominous sign of severe upper airway obstruction and requires immediate emergency intervention to secure the airway."
        },
        {
            "key": "Lungs have scattered crackles in the left lower lobe.",
            "value": "Incorrect. The client was admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. Scattered crackles in the affected lobe are an expected finding related to the client's admitting diagnosis, not the acute allergic reaction."
        },
        {
            "key": "Vital signs: Blood pressure is 88/50 mmHg, heart rate is 128/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, SpO2 is 94% on room air, and temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F).",
            "value": "Correct. This set of vital signs indicates circulatory collapse. The profound hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg) and compensatory tachycardia (HR 128/min) are hallmark signs of distributive (anaphylactic) shock. The tachypnea also reflects respiratory distress."
        },
        {
            "key": "Client rates IV site pain as 2/10.",
            "value": "Incorrect. Mild, localized IV site pain is a common finding and is not indicative of a systemic, life-threatening reaction. It is a low-priority finding compared to the signs of airway compromise and shock."
