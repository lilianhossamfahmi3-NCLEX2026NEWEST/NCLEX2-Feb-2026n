The client reports shortness of breath and has 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Vital signs are: T 37.1°C (98.8°F), HR 102, RR 24, BP 104/62 mmHg, SpO2 91% on room air. Laboratory results include: albumin 2.2 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL), INR 2.1, and ammonia 68 mcg/dL (15-45 mcg/dL). The client has been noted to have intermittent confusion.",

        "correct": "The appropriate interventions focus on managing fluid volume excess, improving respiratory status, ensuring safety, and addressing the underlying pathophysiology of ascites in cirrhosis. This includes monitoring fluid retention (abdominal girth), restricting sodium to limit further fluid accumulation, administering albumin to increase intravascular oncotic pressure and pull fluid from the third space, and positioning the client to ease the work of breathing caused by abdominal distention.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options are either contraindicated or inappropriate for this client. Administering an IM injection is unsafe due to the client's coagulopathy (elevated INR), which increases the risk of hematoma formation. A high-protein diet is contraindicated in the presence of elevated ammonia and confusion, as it can worsen hepatic encephalopathy. Strict bed rest is not indicated and increases the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pressure injuries.",
