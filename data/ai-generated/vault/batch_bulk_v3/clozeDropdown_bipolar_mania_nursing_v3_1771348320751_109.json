    "question": "The nurse is developing the plan of care for a 44-year-old client admitted 48 hours ago for an acute manic episode of Bipolar I Disorder. The client is pacing the hallways, has pressured speech, and has slept only 2 hours. The client has eaten very little of their meal trays. The nurse plans the interventions for the upcoming shift.\n\nTo address the client's nutritional status, the nurse should prioritize offering the client **{{dropdown1}}**. To help manage the client's psychomotor agitation, the nurse should redirect the client to **{{dropdown2}}**. When the client begins making grandiose and intrusive comments to other clients in the milieu, the nurse's most appropriate initial action is to **{{dropdown3}}**.",

                        "rationale": "Incorrect. While a well-balanced meal is ideal, a client with acute mania typically has a short attention span and psychomotor agitation that makes it nearly impossible for them to sit through a structured meal. This intervention is unlikely to be successful."

                        "rationale": "Incorrect. A client experiencing acute mania has impaired concentration and is not receptive to education. Their cognitive state prevents them from processing and retaining new information. This intervention is inappropriate for this phase of the illness."

This type of diet is indicated if the client shows signs of lithium toxicity, as high sodium intake can decrease lithium levels and low sodium intake can increase them, risking toxicity. However, it is not the standard nutritional intervention for mania itself; the priority is addressing the caloric deficit from hyperactivity."

                        "rationale": "Incorrect. Competitive activities can escalate agitation, frustration, and aggression in a client with mania due to their low frustration tolerance and potential for grandiosity. This could destabilize the client and the milieu."

The presence of a staff member provides support, structure, and redirection, while the repetitive nature of the task can have a calming effect."

They are unable to benefit from a group therapy session, which requires focus and concentration, and their behavior would likely be disruptive to the group process."

While a quiet activity is intended to decrease stimulation, a client with severe psychomotor agitation is unlikely to be able to sit still and focus on a solitary fine motor task like drawing. They are more likely to require an outlet for their physical energy."

This is a less restrictive, therapeutic communication-based intervention that should be tried before resorting to chemical restraint."

Setting clear, respectful, and consistent limits on intrusive or inappropriate behavior provides structure and security for the client and maintains a safe environment for all. It addresses the behavior directly in a therapeutic and non-punitive manner."
