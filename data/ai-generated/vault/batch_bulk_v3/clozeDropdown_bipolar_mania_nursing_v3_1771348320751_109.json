  "question": "The nurse is developing the plan of care for a 44-year-old client admitted 48 hours ago for an acute manic episode of Bipolar I Disorder. The client is pacing the hallways, has pressured speech, and has slept only 2 hours. The client has eaten very little of their meal trays. The nurse plans the interventions for the upcoming shift.\n\nTo address the client's nutritional status, the nurse should prioritize offering the client **{{dropdown1}}**. To help manage the client's psychomotor agitation, the nurse should redirect the client to **{{dropdown2}}**. When the client begins making grandiose and intrusive comments to other clients in the milieu, the nurse's most appropriate initial action is to **{{dropdown3}}**.",

Providing high-calorie, easily consumed finger foods and milkshakes addresses the client's increased metabolic demands and decreased ability to focus on structured meals. This approach helps prevent weight loss and maintain adequate nutritional intake. The pathophysiology behind this is the hyperactivity and distractibility associated with mania, leading to inadequate oral intake.",

A well-balanced meal tray requires the client to sit and concentrate, which is unlikely to occur during a manic episode. This approach does not address the client's immediate needs.",

While a quiet activity is intended to decrease stimulation, a client with severe psychomotor agitation is unlikely to be able to sit still and focus on a solitary fine motor task like drawing. They are more likely to require an outlet for their physical energy. The client needs an activity that allows for physical movement and energy expenditure.",

Setting clear, respectful, and consistent limits on intrusive or inappropriate behavior provides structure and security for the client and maintains a safe environment for all. It addresses the behavior directly in a therapeutic and non-punitive manner. The pathophysiology behind this is that limit-setting provides external control and structure, which the client is unable to provide for themselves during a manic episode.",
