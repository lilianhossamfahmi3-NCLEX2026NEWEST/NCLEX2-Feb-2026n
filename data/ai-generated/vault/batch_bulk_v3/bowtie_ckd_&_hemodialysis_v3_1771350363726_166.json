            "pc1": "Incorrect. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is caused by rapid shifts in solutes from the blood, leading to cerebral edema. It is characterized by neurological symptoms such as headache, confusion, restlessness, and seizures, not primarily by severe hypotension and tachycardia.",
            "pc2": "Correct. The client's presentation of a significant drop in blood pressure (from 168/94 mmHg to 88/50 mmHg), compensatory tachycardia (118 bpm), dizziness, nausea, pallor, and diaphoresis immediately following the removal of 3.6 L of fluid is the classic presentation of dialysis-induced hypotension due to excessive or rapid ultrafiltration.",
            "pc3": "Incorrect. While the client has diabetes, the symptoms are more specific to hypovolemia than hypoglycemia. Classic signs of hypoglycemia include shakiness, anxiety, and confusion, but the profound drop in blood pressure is the key differentiating factor pointing to a fluid volume issue.",
            "pc4": "Incorrect. An air embolism would present with sudden-onset dyspnea, chest pain, cyanosis, and a sense of impending doom. The client's primary symptoms are related to poor perfusion from low blood pressure, not acute respiratory compromise.",
            "pc5": "Incorrect. An anaphylactic reaction to the dialyzer (a type A reaction) typically occurs within the first few minutes of starting dialysis, not at the end. It would involve symptoms like severe respiratory distress, hives, and profound hypotension, but the timing in this scenario makes it highly unlikely."
        },
        "actionsToTake": {
            "a1": "Incorrect. Administering an antihypertensive medication would further lower the client's already critically low blood pressure (88/50 mmHg) and worsen the condition, potentially leading to shock.",
            "a2": "Correct. This is a priority nursing action for hypotension. Placing the client in a supine position with legs elevated (a modified Trendelenburg position) uses gravity to promote venous return to the central circulation, which can help increase cardiac output and blood pressure.",
            "a3": "Correct. Dialysis-induced hypotension is caused by a deficit in intravascular volume. Administering an isotonic fluid bolus, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, is the primary medical intervention to rapidly restore circulating volume and increase blood pressure.",
            "a4": "Incorrect. Seizure precautions are indicated for clients at risk for seizures, such as those with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. This client's primary problem is hemodynamic instability, not neurological irritability.",
            "a5": "Incorrect. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for heparin, which is used during dialysis to prevent clotting. It has no role in treating hypotension and would only be used if there were signs of excessive bleeding related to heparinization."
        },
        "parametersToMonitor": {
            "p1": "Correct. The defining problem is severe hypotension. Therefore, frequent monitoring of the blood pressure is the most critical parameter to assess the client's response to interventions (positioning, fluid bolus) and to determine if further action is needed.",
            "p2": "Incorrect. The client has end-stage renal disease and is likely anuric or severely oliguric. Urine output is not a reliable or timely indicator of fluid status or renal perfusion in this client.",
            "p3": "Correct. A decreased level of consciousness is a sensitive indicator of cerebral hypoperfusion. Monitoring for any changes, such as increased lethargy or confusion, is essential to detect worsening of the client's condition due to persistent hypotension.",
            "p4": "Incorrect. While assessing the AV fistula for patency (bruit and thrill) is a standard part of post-dialysis care, it is not a priority parameter for monitoring the systemic effects of acute hypotension and the response to treatment.",
            "p5": "Incorrect. Although dialysis affects serum potassium, monitoring this level is not the priority in the immediate management of acute, symptomatic hypotension. The immediate threat is circulatory collapse, not an electrolyte imbalance."
