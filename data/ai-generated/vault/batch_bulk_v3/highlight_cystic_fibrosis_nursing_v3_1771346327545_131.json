    "correct": "The nurse should immediately follow up on findings indicating acute deterioration or significant risk. An SpO2 of 89% despite oxygen therapy indicates hypoxemia, where the oxygen saturation is below the normal range (typically 95-100%). Absent breath sounds can indicate a mucus plug, atelectasis, or pneumothorax, preventing adequate gas exchange in that lung region. New-onset hemoptysis indicates potential airway damage and risk of hemorrhage. Hyperglycemia (blood glucose of 255 mg/dL) can impair immune function and wound healing, increasing the risk of infection. These findings require urgent intervention to prevent respiratory failure and other complications.",
