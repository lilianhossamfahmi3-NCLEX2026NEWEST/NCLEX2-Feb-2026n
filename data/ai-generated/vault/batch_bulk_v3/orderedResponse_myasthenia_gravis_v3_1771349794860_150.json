The client reports taking her scheduled dose of pyridostigmine 60 minutes prior to arrival. Vital signs are: heart rate 122/min, blood pressure 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 28/min and shallow, and SpO2 89% on room air. The client has difficulty managing oral secretions and an audible wheeze. The healthcare provider is at the bedside.",

This is crucial for administering emergency medications (e.g., sedatives for intubation, IV immunoglobulins, or anticholinesterase agents) and fluids. While vital, it is prioritized after immediate life-sustaining respiratory interventions have been initiated."

This test helps differentiate between a myasthenic crisis (undermedication) and a cholinergic crisis (overmedication). However, this is a diagnostic, not a life-saving, measure and should only be performed after the client's airway and breathing are stabilized, as it can worsen a cholinergic crisis and precipitate respiratory arrest."
