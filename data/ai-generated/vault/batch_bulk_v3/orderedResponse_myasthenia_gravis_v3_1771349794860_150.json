The client reports taking her scheduled dose of pyridostigmine 60 minutes prior to arrival. Vital signs are: heart rate 122/min, blood pressure 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 28/min and shallow, and SpO2 89% on room air. The client has difficulty managing oral secretions and an audible wheeze. The healthcare provider is at the bedside.",

This position maximizes lung expansion by decreasing pressure on the diaphragm and promoting optimal chest excursion. In MG, weakened respiratory muscles compromise ventilation. High-Fowler's facilitates improved airflow and reduces the work of breathing, addressing the immediate respiratory distress. Clinical Pearl: Elevating the head of the bed is a rapid, non-invasive intervention that can significantly improve oxygenation in patients with respiratory compromise.",

        "rationale": "Administering supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask is the next priority. The client's SpO2 of 89% indicates hypoxemia. A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-95%) to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, improving oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. This directly counteracts the hypoxemia caused by weakened respiratory muscles and ineffective gas exchange. Clinical Pearl: Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 >94%, but be vigilant for signs of CO2 retention in patients with underlying respiratory conditions.",

        "optionId": "OPT_01",
        "rationale": "Preparing for endotracheal intubation is crucial. The client's shallow respirations, difficulty managing secretions, and persistent hypoxemia despite oxygen supplementation suggest impending respiratory failure. Proactive preparation for intubation ensures a secure airway and allows for mechanical ventilation to support oxygenation and ventilation if the client's respiratory status deteriorates further. This prevents respiratory arrest and potential brain damage from prolonged hypoxia. Clinical Pearl: Early intubation is preferred over emergent intubation in patients with MG crisis to avoid complications associated with rapid desaturation and aspiration.",

        "rationale": "Establishing IV access is important for administering medications and fluids. In MG crisis, IV access is needed for administering anticholinesterase medications (if myasthenic crisis), corticosteroids, or IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). It also allows for rapid administration of fluids if the client becomes hypotensive. However, securing the airway and improving oxygenation take precedence. Clinical Pearl: Use a large-bore IV catheter (18 gauge or larger) to facilitate rapid fluid and medication administration in emergency situations.",

        "rationale": "Preparing to administer edrophonium (Tensilon) is the lowest priority. Edrophonium is a short-acting anticholinesterase used to differentiate between myasthenic crisis (improvement in muscle strength) and cholinergic crisis (worsening of muscle weakness). However, administering edrophonium can be dangerous in a cholinergic crisis, potentially causing bradycardia, increased secretions, and respiratory arrest. It should only be considered after the client's airway and breathing are stabilized and the underlying cause of the crisis is determined. Clinical Pearl: Have atropine readily available as an antidote when administering edrophonium, as it can reverse the effects of cholinergic crisis.",
