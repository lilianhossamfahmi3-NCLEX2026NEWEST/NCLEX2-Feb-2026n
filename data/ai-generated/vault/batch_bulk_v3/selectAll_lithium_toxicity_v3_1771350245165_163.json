    "scenario": "A 48-year-old male client with a history of bipolar I disorder, managed with lithium carbonate for the past five years, presents to the mental health clinic for a scheduled follow-up. The client states, \"I had a bad stomach flu a few days ago with a lot of vomiting and diarrhea, but I'm feeling a bit better now. I just feel really tired and shaky.\" During the assessment, the nurse observes the client is slow to respond to questions and has an unsteady gait when walking from the waiting room. The client's hands have a visible, coarse tremor.",

            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Rationale: A fine hand tremor can be a common, expected side effect of lithium therapy. However, the development of a coarse hand tremor is a classic sign of neurotoxicity and is indicative of moderate to severe lithium toxicity."
        },
        "opt_2": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Rationale: A blood pressure reading of 118/76 mmHg is within the normal range for an adult. While severe lithium toxicity can lead to cardiovascular collapse and hypotension, this finding is unremarkable and not a cue for toxicity in this context."
        },
        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Rationale: Ataxia, or an unsteady, uncoordinated gait, is a significant sign of central nervous system toxicity associated with elevated lithium levels. It reflects impaired cerebellar function and requires immediate intervention."
        },
        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Rationale: A recent history of vomiting and diarrhea is a critical cue. These conditions cause dehydration and sodium depletion. The kidneys conserve sodium to compensate, but in doing so, they also increase the reabsorption of lithium, leading to decreased renal clearance and a rapid rise in serum lithium levels to toxic ranges."
        },
        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Rationale: Slowed cognition, confusion, and lethargy are early to moderate signs of lithium-induced neurotoxicity. The client being 'slow to respond to questions' is an important objective cue that points towards toxic levels of the medication."
        },
        "opt_6": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Rationale: Increased thirst (polydipsia) and increased urine output (polyuria) are common, long-term side effects of lithium therapy due to its effect on the kidneys (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). While it is a side effect, it is not an acute sign of toxicity and is less concerning than the neurological symptoms presented."
