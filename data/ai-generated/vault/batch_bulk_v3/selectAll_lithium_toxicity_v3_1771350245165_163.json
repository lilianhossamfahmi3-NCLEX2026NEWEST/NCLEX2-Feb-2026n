  "scenario": "A 48-year-old male client with a history of bipolar I disorder, managed with lithium carbonate for the past five years, presents to the mental health clinic for a scheduled follow-up. The client states, \"I had a bad stomach flu a few days ago with a lot of vomiting and diarrhea, but I'm feeling a bit better now. I just feel really tired and shaky.\" During the assessment, the nurse observes the client is slow to respond to questions and has an unsteady gait when walking from the waiting room. The client's hands have a visible, coarse tremor.",
  "stem": "The nurse is reviewing the assessment findings. Which cues should the nurse recognize as potential indicators of lithium toxicity? (Select all that apply.)",

    "opt_1": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Rationale: A fine hand tremor is a common side effect of lithium. However, a *coarse* hand tremor indicates moderate to severe lithium toxicity due to neurotoxicity. Lithium affects neurotransmitter activity and neuronal excitability. Elevated levels disrupt normal neuronal function, leading to motor control issues. This requires immediate assessment and potential intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Rationale: A blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg is within normal limits. While severe lithium toxicity can cause cardiovascular issues, this BP reading does not indicate toxicity. Focus on neurological and gastrointestinal cues first.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Rationale: Ataxia (unsteady gait) is a significant sign of lithium-induced neurotoxicity. Lithium toxicity affects the cerebellum, responsible for coordination and balance. The disruption of cerebellar function leads to impaired motor control and an unsteady gait. This warrants immediate intervention to prevent falls and further neurological complications.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Rationale: Vomiting and diarrhea cause dehydration and sodium loss. The kidneys compensate by retaining sodium, which increases lithium reabsorption, leading to elevated lithium levels. Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and its reabsorption is inversely related to sodium. Dehydration significantly reduces lithium clearance, rapidly increasing serum levels and the risk of toxicity.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Rationale: Slowed cognition indicates lithium-induced neurotoxicity. Lithium affects neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter systems. Elevated levels disrupt normal brain function, leading to cognitive impairment, lethargy, and confusion. This requires prompt assessment and intervention to prevent further neurological damage.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Rationale: Increased thirst (polydipsia) is a common *side effect* of long-term lithium therapy due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, where the kidneys are less responsive to ADH. While uncomfortable, it's not an *acute* sign of toxicity. Focus on the acute neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms.",
      "scoringWeight": 1
    }
  },
  "clinicalPearl": "Early signs of lithium toxicity can be subtle and easily missed. Always consider recent changes in fluid balance, medication adherence, and concurrent illnesses. Monitor serum lithium levels regularly, especially during periods of dehydration or illness. Educate patients to recognize and report early signs of toxicity.",

    "situation": "0700: 48-year-old male with bipolar I disorder on lithium presents to clinic with recent vomiting/diarrhea, fatigue, and shakiness.",
    "background": "Client has been on lithium carbonate for 5 years. Reports recent stomach flu with vomiting and diarrhea for past few days.",
    "assessment": "Client exhibits coarse hand tremors, ataxic gait, and slowed cognition. BP 118/76 mmHg. Reports increased thirst. Serum lithium level unknown.",
    "recommendation": "STAT serum lithium level. Assess neurological status q2h. Administer IV fluids for dehydration. Contact provider with lab results and assessment findings for further orders. Possible dialysis if lithium level critically high. Ensure patient safety due to risk of falls."
