    "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder. The client presents with coarse hand tremors, confusion, ataxia, and persistent gastrointestinal upset. The provider has just reviewed the laboratory results, which show a serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L (Therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The client is experiencing severe lithium toxicity, as evidenced by a serum level of 2.1 mEq/L and significant neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia, coarse tremors). The priority nursing actions are to stabilize the client, promote lithium excretion, and prepare for definitive treatment. Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial due to the risk of dysrhythmias and ECG changes associated with lithium toxicity. Administering 0.9% sodium chloride IV promotes renal excretion of lithium by increasing sodium levels and hydrating the client. Preparing for hemodialysis is essential as it is the most effective treatment for rapidly removing lithium from the body in cases of severe toxicity.",
        "incorrect": "Contraindicated or non-priority actions should not be selected. Thiazide diuretics are contraindicated because they increase sodium excretion, which leads to increased lithium reabsorption by the kidneys, worsening the toxicity. Fluid restriction is also contraindicated as it would cause dehydration, decrease renal blood flow, and impair lithium clearance. While an antiemetic may address a symptom, it is not a priority intervention for treating the life-threatening toxicity and could mask a worsening neurological status.",
