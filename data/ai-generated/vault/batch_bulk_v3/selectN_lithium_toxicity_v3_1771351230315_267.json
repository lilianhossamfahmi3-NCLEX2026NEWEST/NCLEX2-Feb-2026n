  "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder. The client presents with coarse hand tremors, confusion, ataxia, and persistent gastrointestinal upset. The provider has just reviewed the laboratory results, which show a serum lithium level of 2.1 mEq/L (Therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Using SBAR and military time, which actions should the nurse implement? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The client is experiencing severe lithium toxicity (serum level 2.1 mEq/L, therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L) with neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia, coarse tremors) and GI distress. SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) guides immediate actions. \n\n**S:** 45-year-old with bipolar I disorder presenting with lithium toxicity.\n**B:** History of bipolar I disorder, currently taking lithium. Admitted at 1400 with altered mental status and GI upset.\n**A:** Serum lithium 2.1 mEq/L. Coarse tremors, confusion, ataxia, persistent GI upset. ECG pending. Risk for dysrhythmias and seizures.\n**R:** Initiate cardiac monitoring, administer 0.9% NaCl IV, prepare for possible hemodialysis. Avoid thiazide diuretics and fluid restriction.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Lithium toxicity occurs when lithium accumulates in the body, exceeding the kidneys' ability to excrete it. This can be due to dehydration, decreased renal function, drug interactions (e.g., thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs), or intentional overdose. Elevated lithium levels disrupt neuronal function, leading to neurological and cardiovascular complications. Lithium interferes with sodium transport in nerve and muscle cells, affecting action potentials and neurotransmitter release. The gastrointestinal symptoms are likely due to lithium's irritant effect on the GI mucosa.\n\n**Cardiac Monitoring:** Lithium toxicity can cause bradycardia, T-wave inversions, QT prolongation, and other dysrhythmias. Continuous monitoring allows for prompt detection and treatment of these potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n**0.9% Sodium Chloride:** Lithium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules of the kidneys in competition with sodium. Administering 0.9% NaCl promotes sodium excretion, which in turn enhances lithium excretion, lowering serum levels. Hydration also improves renal perfusion and clearance.\n\n**Hemodialysis:** Hemodialysis is the most effective method for rapidly removing lithium from the body in severe cases (typically >2.0 mEq/L) or when there are significant neurological or renal complications. It is indicated when conservative measures (IV fluids) are insufficient.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early recognition of lithium toxicity is crucial. Monitor lithium levels regularly, especially after dosage changes or if the client develops dehydration or takes interacting medications. Educate clients about the signs and symptoms of toxicity and the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and sodium intake.",
    "incorrect": "Thiazide diuretics increase lithium levels, worsening toxicity. Fluid restriction exacerbates dehydration, impairing lithium excretion. Antiemetics address a symptom but do not treat the underlying toxicity and can mask neurological deterioration. \n\n**Thiazide Diuretics:** These diuretics increase sodium excretion, leading to increased lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, thereby elevating serum lithium levels and worsening toxicity. This is contraindicated.\n\n**Fluid Restriction:** Dehydration reduces renal blood flow and impairs lithium clearance, leading to further accumulation of lithium in the body. Aggressive hydration is essential to promote lithium excretion.\n\n**Antiemetics:** While GI upset is a symptom of lithium toxicity, addressing the underlying cause (elevated lithium levels) is the priority. Antiemetics may mask worsening neurological status and delay definitive treatment.",
