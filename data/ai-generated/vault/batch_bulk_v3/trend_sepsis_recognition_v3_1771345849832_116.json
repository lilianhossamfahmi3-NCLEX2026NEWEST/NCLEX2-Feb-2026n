  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client is progressing from sepsis to septic shock. The ruptured appendix led to peritonitis, causing a systemic inflammatory response. The body's attempt to fight the infection results in widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. This leads to hypotension (09:56 BP 94/56), tachycardia (09:56 HR 118), and tachypnea (09:56 RR 26) as the body tries to compensate. The elevated WBC (18.2 x 10³/μL) indicates the body's immune response. Rising lactate (2.9 mmol/L) signifies anaerobic metabolism due to hypoperfusion. Decreased urine output (60 mL/4 hrs) and rising creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) indicate acute kidney injury from decreased renal perfusion. Lethargy suggests decreased cerebral perfusion. Abdominal distention and tenderness indicate ongoing peritonitis.",
    "incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because a typical post-operative inflammatory response would improve, not worsen, after three days. Option B is incorrect because while dehydration contributes, it doesn't explain the fever, leukocytosis, or elevated lactate. Option D is incorrect because opioid side effects don't account for the fever, elevated WBC, and lactate.",
