The client meets sepsis criteria with a suspected infection and signs of organ dysfunction (qSOFA score ≥2: altered mental status, tachypnea, hypotension). The progression is evident in the worsening trends across all tabs: persistent fever, progressive tachycardia (118/min), tachypnea (26/min), and developing hypotension (94/56 mmHg). Laboratory data shows worsening leukocytosis (18.2 x 10³/μL), rising serum lactate (2.9 mmol/L) indicating tissue hypoperfusion, and rising creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) suggesting acute kidney injury. The nurses' notes confirm the clinical decline with new-onset lethargy, oliguria (15 mL/hr), and signs of peritonitis (distended, tender abdomen). This constellation of findings is classic for the development of septic shock.",
        "incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they fail to account for the complete clinical picture. A typical post-operative inflammatory response would show resolving, not worsening, signs after 3 days. Dehydration could explain tachycardia and low urine output, but not the high fever, marked leukocytosis, rising lactate, or acute mental status change. An adverse opioid reaction could cause lethargy and hypotension, but it would not explain the fever, elevated WBC, or rising lactate, which are hallmark signs of a severe infectious process.",
