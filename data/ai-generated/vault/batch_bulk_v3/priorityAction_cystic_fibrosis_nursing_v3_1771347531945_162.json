The report indicates the child has an increased productive cough with thick, yellow sputum, decreased appetite, and a 2 kg weight loss over the past week. The nurse's initial assessment reveals the following findings:\n\n**Vital Signs**\n*   Heart Rate: 128/min\n*   Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)\n*   Respiratory Rate: 32/min\n*   SpO2: 90% on room air\n\n**Assessment Findings**\n*   Coarse crackles heard bilaterally\n*   Mild intercostal retractions noted\n*   Appears fatigued and is refusing breakfast\n\n**Provider Orders**\n*   Oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%\n*   Tobramycin IV every 8 hours\n*   Chest physiotherapy (CPT) every 4 hours and PRN\n*   High-calorie, high-protein diet\n*   Pancreatic enzymes with all meals and snacks\n\nWhich action should the nurse take first?",

        "correct": "The most appropriate first action is to apply oxygen via nasal cannula. The child is exhibiting signs of hypoxemia (SpO2 90%) and increased work of breathing (respiratory rate of 32/min, intercostal retractions). According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework for prioritization, addressing inadequate oxygenation is the immediate priority to prevent further respiratory decompensation and reduce cardiac and respiratory workload. The provider's order is already in place to support this critical intervention.",
        "incorrect": "While all other options are appropriate interventions for a child with a cystic fibrosis exacerbation, they are not the immediate priority. Administering antibiotics treats the underlying infection but does not provide immediate respiratory relief. Performing CPT is contraindicated when a patient is in respiratory distress as it can increase oxygen demand. Nutrition is important for long-term health but is secondary to stabilizing oxygenation. Contacting another team member is a collaborative action but delays the direct, immediate nursing care that is needed.",
