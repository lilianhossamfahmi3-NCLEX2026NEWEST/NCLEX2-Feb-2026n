The report indicates the child has an increased productive cough with thick, yellow sputum, decreased appetite, and a 2 kg weight loss over the past week. The nurse's initial assessment reveals the following findings:\n\n**Vital Signs**\n*   Heart Rate: 128/min\n*   Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)\n*   Respiratory Rate: 32/min\n*   SpO2: 90% on room air\n\n**Assessment Findings**\n*   Coarse crackles heard bilaterally\n*   Mild intercostal retractions noted\n*   Appears fatigued and is refusing breakfast\n\n**Provider Orders**\n*   Oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%\n*   Tobramycin IV every 8 hours\n*   Chest physiotherapy (CPT) every 4 hours and PRN\n*   High-calorie, high-protein diet\n*   Pancreatic enzymes with all meals and snacks\n\nWhich action should the nurse take first?",

    "correct": "The priority action is to apply oxygen via nasal cannula. The child exhibits hypoxemia (SpO2 90%), tachypnea (RR 32/min), and intercostal retractions, indicating respiratory distress. According to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), addressing breathing and oxygenation is paramount. Hypoxemia in CF exacerbations results from ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to mucus plugging and airway inflammation, hindering gas exchange. Supplemental oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, improving oxygen saturation and reducing the workload on the respiratory system. The provider's order supports this immediate intervention.",
    "incorrect": "While other options are appropriate for CF exacerbation management, they are not the immediate priority. Tobramycin addresses the underlying infection but doesn't provide immediate respiratory relief. CPT is crucial for airway clearance but can increase oxygen demand in a distressed patient. Nutrition is important but secondary to stabilizing oxygenation. Contacting the respiratory therapist delays direct patient care.",

While crucial for treating the underlying Pseudomonas infection common in CF, it takes time to be effective and doesn't address the immediate hypoxemia.

Antibiotics like tobramycin target these bacteria, but their effect is not immediate.

CPT mobilizes this mucus, but if the patient is already struggling to breathe, it can increase their oxygen demand and respiratory effort.
