The client exhibits severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82.8) and respiratory acidosis. The correct interventions aim to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improve oxygenation. Decreasing the tidal volume to 4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight is crucial to prevent volutrauma. Increasing PEEP helps recruit collapsed alveoli to improve oxygenation. Proning is an evidence-based intervention for severe ARDS that improves ventilation/perfusion matching.",

Administering a fluid bolus is risky in ARDS due to capillary leak and can worsen pulmonary edema. Decreasing the respiratory rate would exacerbate the existing respiratory acidosis by causing further CO2 retention.",
