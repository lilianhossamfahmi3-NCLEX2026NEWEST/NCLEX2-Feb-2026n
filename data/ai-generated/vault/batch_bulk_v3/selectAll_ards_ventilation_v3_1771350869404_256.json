    "correct": "The selected actions align with the principles of lung-protective ventilation for ARDS, aiming to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improve oxygenation. The client exhibits severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82.8) and respiratory acidosis. Decreasing the tidal volume to 4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) is crucial to prevent volutrauma, a type of VILI caused by overdistension of alveoli. Increasing PEEP helps recruit collapsed alveoli, improving gas exchange and potentially allowing for a reduction in FiO2. Proning is an evidence-based intervention for severe ARDS that improves ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching by redistributing lung perfusion and reducing alveolar compression. In ARDS, inflammatory mediators increase pulmonary capillary permeability, leading to alveolar edema and impaired gas exchange. The resulting hypoxemia and hypercapnia stimulate chemoreceptors, increasing the work of breathing. Lung-protective ventilation strategies aim to minimize further lung damage and support gas exchange while the underlying inflammation resolves.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options are either contraindicated or not the priority in this clinical scenario. Increasing FiO2 to 100% does not address the underlying intrapulmonary shunt and increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which can further damage the lungs. Administering a fluid bolus is risky in ARDS due to increased pulmonary capillary permeability, which can worsen pulmonary edema and impair gas exchange. Decreasing the respiratory rate would exacerbate the existing respiratory acidosis by causing further CO2 retention. In ARDS, the primary problem is impaired gas exchange due to alveolar edema and collapse, not fluid volume deficit or inadequate respiratory rate.",
