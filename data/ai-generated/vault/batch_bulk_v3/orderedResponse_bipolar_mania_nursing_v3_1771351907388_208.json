  "question": "A 32-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder was involuntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for an acute manic episode. The nurse observes the client pacing rapidly in the dayroom, speaking loudly, and intruding on other clients' conversations. The client suddenly shouts at another client, \"You keep staring at me! You'll regret it!\" The client's fists are clenched, and they are standing over the other client. The nurse must intervene immediately. Drag and drop the nursing actions into the correct order of priority.",
  "options": [
    "Place the client in seclusion if de-escalation attempts are unsuccessful.",
    "Escort the threatened client and other vulnerable clients out of the dayroom.",
    "Speak to the agitated client in a calm, firm voice, stating, \"Let's go to the quiet room to talk.\"",
    "Offer the client a prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine.",
    "Document the incident and the client's response to interventions in the electronic health record."

    "1": {
      "option": "Escort the threatened client and other vulnerable clients out of the dayroom.",
      "rationale": "**Prioritization:** Immediate safety is paramount. The client's verbal threat and aggressive posturing (clenched fists) indicate imminent risk. \n**Pathophysiology:** Mania can impair judgment and impulse control, leading to aggressive behaviors. Protecting vulnerable individuals is the priority.\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize the safety of the client and others in a psychiatric setting. Removing the threatened client and others minimizes the risk of physical harm and reduces environmental stimuli that could further escalate the situation.",

      "option": "Speak to the agitated client in a calm, firm voice, stating, \"Let's go to the quiet room to talk.\"",
      "rationale": "**SBAR (Situation):** Client exhibiting escalating agitation and threatening behavior.\n**Background:** History of bipolar I disorder, acute manic episode.\n**Assessment:** Pacing, loud speech, intruding on conversations, verbal threat, clenched fists.\n**Recommendation:** De-escalate verbally by offering a calm, quiet space.\n**Pathophysiology:** A calm approach can help reduce the client's anxiety and agitation by providing a sense of control and security. A quiet room minimizes external stimuli that can exacerbate manic symptoms.\n**Clinical Pearl:** Use a non-threatening posture and maintain a safe distance. Avoid arguing or raising your voice.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "3": {
      "option": "Offer the client a prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine.",
      "rationale": "**Timing:** Offer PRN medication after attempting verbal de-escalation.\n**Pathophysiology:** Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain, reducing manic symptoms such as agitation, racing thoughts, and impulsivity. It helps stabilize mood and prevent further escalation.\n**Clinical Pearl:** Monitor the client for side effects of olanzapine, such as sedation, dizziness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Ensure the client swallows the medication and does not cheek it.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "4": {
      "option": "Place the client in seclusion if de-escalation attempts are unsuccessful.",
      "rationale": "**Least Restrictive:** Seclusion is a last resort when other interventions fail.\n**Pathophysiology:** Seclusion provides a safe, controlled environment to prevent the client from harming themselves or others. It reduces external stimuli and allows the client to regain control.\n**Clinical Pearl:** Continuous monitoring is essential during seclusion. Document the client's behavior, vital signs, and any interventions provided every 15 minutes. Follow hospital policy and legal guidelines for seclusion.",
      "correct": true
    },
    "5": {
      "option": "Document the incident and the client's response to interventions in the electronic health record.",
      "rationale": "**Timing:** Documentation occurs after ensuring safety and implementing interventions.\n**Pathophysiology:** Accurate documentation provides a legal record of the incident, interventions, and the client's response. It facilitates communication among healthcare providers and ensures continuity of care.\n**Clinical Pearl:** Document objective observations, not subjective interpretations. Include the time of events, interventions, and the client's response.",
