    "question": "A 32-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder was involuntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for an acute manic episode. The nurse observes the client pacing rapidly in the dayroom, speaking loudly, and intruding on other clients' conversations. The client suddenly shouts at another client, \"You keep staring at me! You'll regret it!\" The client's fists are clenched, and they are standing over the other client. The nurse must intervene immediately. Drag and drop the nursing actions into the correct order of priority.",
    "options": [
        "Place the client in seclusion if de-escalation attempts are unsuccessful.",
        "Escort the threatened client and other vulnerable clients out of the dayroom.",
        "Speak to the agitated client in a calm, firm voice, stating, \"Let's go to the quiet room to talk.\"",
        "Offer the client a prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine.",
        "Document the incident and the client's response to interventions in the electronic health record."

        "1": {
            "option": "Escort the threatened client and other vulnerable clients out of the dayroom.",
            "rationale": "The immediate priority is the physical safety of all individuals in the milieu. The client is making a direct verbal threat and demonstrating aggressive posturing (clenched fists), indicating an imminent risk of violence. Removing the potential victim and other clients from the volatile situation is the fastest and most effective way to prevent physical harm and reduce stimuli for the agitated client."
        },
        "2": {
            "option": "Speak to the agitated client in a calm, firm voice, stating, \"Let's go to the quiet room to talk.\"",
            "rationale": "After ensuring the safety of others, the nurse must directly address the agitated client. Using a calm, firm, and non-threatening tone with simple, direct language is a key de-escalation technique. Redirecting the client to a less stimulating environment removes them from the source of agitation and provides a safe space for further intervention without an audience."
        },
        "3": {
            "option": "Offer the client a prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine.",
            "rationale": "Once in a less stimulating environment, if the client remains agitated and verbal de-escalation is not fully effective, offering prescribed PRN medication is the next appropriate step. Pharmacological intervention can help reduce agitation, racing thoughts, and irritability, thereby preventing further escalation and the need for more restrictive measures like seclusion."
        },
        "4": {
            "option": "Place the client in seclusion if de-escalation attempts are unsuccessful.",
            "rationale": "Seclusion is a highly restrictive intervention and is used as a last resort according to the principle of using the least restrictive means necessary. It is only implemented when less restrictive measures (verbal de-escalation, medication) have failed and the client continues to pose an imminent danger to themself or others. This action is reserved for situations where the safety risk is unmanageable by other means."
        },
        "5": {
            "option": "Document the incident and the client's response to interventions in the electronic health record.",
            "rationale": "Accurate and timely documentation is a critical nursing responsibility, but it must be performed only after the immediate crisis has been resolved and all clients are safe. The documentation should include objective descriptions of the client's behavior, all interventions implemented in sequence (de-escalation, medication, seclusion), the client's response, and any notifications made to the healthcare provider. Safety and patient care always precede charting."
