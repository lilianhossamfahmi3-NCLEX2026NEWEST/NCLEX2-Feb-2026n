  "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted with a new diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and is being prepared for an adrenalectomy. The client's vital signs are: BP 190/114 mmHg, HR 118/min, RR 22/min, SpO2 97% on room air. The nurse is reviewing the anticipated plan of care. Which pharmacological intervention is the priority to initiate first in preparing this client for surgery?",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority pharmacological intervention for a client with pheochromocytoma preparing for surgery is to initiate an alpha-adrenergic blocker, such as phenoxybenzamine. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete excessive catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These catecholamines bind to alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing intense vasoconstriction, leading to severe hypertension and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular complications. Alpha-blockers competitively inhibit the binding of catecholamines to alpha-receptors, promoting vasodilation and lowering blood pressure. This is crucial to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery when tumor manipulation can cause massive catecholamine release. Typically, alpha-blockade is initiated 10-14 days preoperatively to allow for blood volume expansion and stabilization of blood pressure.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker before establishing adequate alpha-blockade is contraindicated as it can lead to a paradoxical hypertensive crisis due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Loop diuretics are generally avoided as these clients are often volume-depleted from chronic vasoconstriction and diaphoresis. Vasopressors would dangerously elevate the already critically high blood pressure.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "This is incorrect. Beta-adrenergic blockers like metoprolol block beta receptors. If administered before alpha-blockade, beta-2 receptor blockade (which causes vasodilation) leaves alpha-1 receptor stimulation (which causes vasoconstriction) unopposed. This can precipitate a hypertensive crisis due to the overwhelming alpha-adrenergic effects.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "This is incorrect. The client is already experiencing severe hypertension (190/114 mmHg) due to excessive catecholamines. Administering a vasopressor like norepinephrine, which stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, would further increase vasoconstriction and dangerously elevate blood pressure, potentially leading to stroke or myocardial infarction.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "This is correct. The cornerstone of pre-operative management for pheochromocytoma is initiating an alpha-adrenergic blocker like phenoxybenzamine. This medication blocks the effects of catecholamines at the alpha-receptors, causing vasodilation and reducing blood pressure. This is essential for controlling the severe hypertension and preventing life-threatening blood pressure fluctuations during surgery. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective, irreversible alpha-blocker, often preferred for its long duration of action.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "This is incorrect. Clients with pheochromocytoma often have a contracted intravascular volume due to chronic vasoconstriction and increased capillary permeability caused by high levels of catecholamines. Administering a loop diuretic like furosemide would worsen this volume depletion and could lead to severe hypotension after the tumor is removed and catecholamine levels fall. Volume expansion with fluids is often necessary after alpha-blockade is initiated.",

    "recommendation": "The priority is to initiate an alpha-adrenergic blocker, such as phenoxybenzamine, to control blood pressure before surgery. Monitor blood pressure closely and anticipate the need for fluid resuscitation. Consult with the physician regarding titration of the alpha-blocker and potential addition of a beta-blocker after adequate alpha-blockade is achieved."

    "In patients with pheochromocytoma, always initiate alpha-adrenergic blockade before beta-adrenergic blockade to prevent a hypertensive crisis.",
    "Monitor blood pressure closely when initiating alpha-blockers, as orthostatic hypotension can occur. Educate the patient to change positions slowly.",
    "Encourage adequate fluid intake to counteract volume depletion associated with pheochromocytoma.",
    "Hypertensive crisis during surgery can be triggered by tumor manipulation.",
    "After tumor removal, monitor for hypoglycemia as insulin secretion may increase rapidly.",
    "Genetic testing should be considered as pheochromocytomas can be associated with inherited syndromes (e.g., MEN2, VHL)."
