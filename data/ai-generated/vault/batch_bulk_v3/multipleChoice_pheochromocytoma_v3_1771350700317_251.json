    "question": "A 45-year-old client is admitted with a new diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and is being prepared for an adrenalectomy. The client's vital signs are: BP 190/114 mmHg, HR 118/min, RR 22/min, SpO2 97% on room air. The nurse is reviewing the anticipated plan of care. Which pharmacological intervention is the priority to initiate first in preparing this client for surgery?",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The priority pharmacological intervention for a client with pheochromocytoma preparing for surgery is to initiate an alpha-adrenergic blocker. The tumor secretes excessive catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), causing severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. Alpha-blockers counteract this effect, leading to vasodilation, which helps control blood pressure and prevent an intraoperative hypertensive crisis. This medication is typically started 10-14 days before surgery to allow for stabilization and blood volume expansion.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a beta-blocker before establishing adequate alpha-blockade is contraindicated as it can lead to a paradoxical hypertensive crisis due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Loop diuretics are generally avoided as these clients are often volume-depleted from chronic vasoconstriction and diaphoresis. Vasopressors would dangerously elevate the already critically high blood pressure.",
