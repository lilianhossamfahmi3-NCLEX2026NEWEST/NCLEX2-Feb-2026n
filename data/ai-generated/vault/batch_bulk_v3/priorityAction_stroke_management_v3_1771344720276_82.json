Failure to do so significantly increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, a life-threatening complication. The provider has an order for labetalol PRN for this exact situation. Therefore, the nurse's first and most critical action is to administer the antihypertensive medication to make the client eligible for the time-sensitive, brain-saving intervention.",
