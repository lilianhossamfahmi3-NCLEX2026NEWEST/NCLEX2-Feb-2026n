    "correct": "**S:** 0815, ED. 68-year-old male, arrived 45 minutes ago with right-sided weakness and aphasia. CT negative for hemorrhage. Preparing for alteplase.\n**B:** Sudden onset of symptoms. NIHSS 12. History of hypertension, but no known contraindications to alteplase other than current BP.\n**A:** BP 192/105 mmHg. Provider order for labetalol 10 mg IV PRN for SBP >185 mmHg or DBP >110 mmHg.\n**R:** Recommend administering labetalol 10 mg IV push immediately to lower BP below 185/110 mmHg to meet alteplase administration criteria. Elevated BP significantly increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage with alteplase. The pathophysiology behind this is that alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots. In the setting of acute ischemic stroke, this helps to restore blood flow to the affected area of the brain. However, in the presence of uncontrolled hypertension, the weakened blood vessels in the brain are at a higher risk of rupture when exposed to the thrombolytic effects of alteplase. This can lead to a hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke, which is a devastating complication. Clinical Pearl: Rapid BP control is paramount before initiating thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke.",
