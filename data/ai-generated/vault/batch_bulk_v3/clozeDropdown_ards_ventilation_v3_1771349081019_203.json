The correct management strategy involves lung-protective ventilation. This requires increasing the PEEP to recruit collapsed alveoli, improve functional residual capacity, and enhance gas exchange, thereby addressing the severe hypoxemia. Simultaneously, the tidal volume must be decreased to a low-volume setting (4-6 mL/kg ideal body weight) to reduce alveolar overdistension and lower the plateau pressure, minimizing barotrauma/volutrauma. The patient's current tidal volume is ~6.9 mL/kg, which is too high given the elevated plateau pressure. The primary, life-saving goal of these combined interventions is to improve oxygenation while preventing further iatrogenic lung injury.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices fail to address the critical issues of refractory hypoxemia and high plateau pressures according to the ARDSnet protocol for lung-protective ventilation. Decreasing or maintaining PEEP would not adequately recruit alveoli to improve oxygenation. Increasing or maintaining the tidal volume would worsen alveolar stretch and increase the risk of barotrauma, especially with an already elevated plateau pressure. Focusing on normalizing PaCO2 is inappropriate in this context, as permissive hypercapnia is an accepted consequence of low-tidal-volume ventilation to protect the lungs. Decreasing the work of breathing is not the primary goal, as the patient is fully supported by the ventilator.",
