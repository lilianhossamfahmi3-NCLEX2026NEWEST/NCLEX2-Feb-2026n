    "question": "A 17-year-old client with cystic fibrosis (CF) is admitted to the pediatric unit for a pulmonary exacerbation. The client reports increased cough, shortness of breath, and production of thick, green sputum. Vital signs are: Temp 100.8°F (38.2°C), HR 115/min, RR 26/min, SpO2 91% on room air. The nurse is developing the plan of care. Which interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The correct interventions focus on the three core principles of CF exacerbation management: airway clearance, infection control, and nutritional support. Administering pancreatic enzymes (C) is crucial for nutrient absorption due to pancreatic insufficiency. A high-calorie, high-protein, high-fat diet (D) is necessary to meet the increased metabolic demands and combat malabsorption. Ensuring adequate hydration (F) by encouraging a high fluid intake is vital to thin the characteristically thick, tenacious mucus, making it easier to clear from the airways.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that are contraindicated or incorrectly timed are inappropriate. Cough suppressants (A) are contraindicated because coughing is the primary mechanism for clearing secretions; suppressing this reflex can lead to mucus plugging and worsen the exacerbation. Performing CPT after meals (B) increases the risk of nausea, vomiting, and aspiration; it should be performed before meals or at least 1-2 hours after. IV tobramycin, an aminoglycoside, must be infused over 30-60 minutes (E) to prevent ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with rapid infusion.",
