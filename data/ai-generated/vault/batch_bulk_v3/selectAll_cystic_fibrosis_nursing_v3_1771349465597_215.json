  "question": "A 17-year-old client with cystic fibrosis (CF) is admitted to the pediatric unit for a pulmonary exacerbation. The client reports increased cough, shortness of breath, and production of thick, green sputum. Vital signs are: Temp 100.8°F (38.2°C), HR 115/min, RR 26/min, SpO2 91% on room air. The nurse is developing the plan of care. Which interventions should the nurse include? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The correct interventions focus on the three core principles of CF exacerbation management: airway clearance, infection control, and nutritional support. Administering pancreatic enzymes (C) is crucial for nutrient absorption due to pancreatic insufficiency. A high-calorie, high-protein, high-fat diet (D) is necessary to meet the increased metabolic demands and combat malabsorption. Ensuring adequate hydration (F) by encouraging a high fluid intake is vital to thin the characteristically thick, tenacious mucus, making it easier to clear from the airways.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that are contraindicated or incorrectly timed are inappropriate. Cough suppressants (A) are contraindicated because coughing is the primary mechanism for clearing secretions; suppressing this reflex can lead to mucus plugging and worsen the exacerbation. Performing CPT after meals (B) increases the risk of nausea, vomiting, and aspiration; it should be performed before meals or at least 1-2 hours after. IV tobramycin, an aminoglycoside, must be infused over 30-60 minutes (E) to prevent ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with rapid infusion.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "This is incorrect. Coughing is a crucial protective mechanism for clearing the thick, tenacious secretions characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Administering antitussives would suppress this essential reflex, leading to retained secretions, mucus plugging, and worsening respiratory infection and distress. **Pathophysiology:** CFTR gene mutation leads to defective chloride transport, resulting in thick mucus production in the lungs. Suppressing the cough reflex prevents the clearance of this mucus, promoting bacterial colonization and infection.",

      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "This is incorrect. While chest physiotherapy is a key intervention, the timing is critical. Performing CPT shortly after a meal significantly increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux, nausea, and vomiting, which can lead to aspiration. CPT should be scheduled 30 minutes to 1 hour before meals or at least 2 hours after meals. **Pathophysiology:** Increased abdominal pressure from a full stomach combined with postural drainage during CPT can overwhelm the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to reflux and potential aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs.",

      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "This is correct. Most individuals with cystic fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, meaning they cannot produce the enzymes necessary to digest fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy must be administered with every meal and snack to ensure adequate nutrient absorption, especially during a high-metabolic state like an exacerbation. **Pathophysiology:** CFTR dysfunction affects the pancreas, leading to blocked pancreatic ducts and impaired enzyme secretion. This results in malabsorption of nutrients, particularly fats, leading to steatorrhea and nutritional deficiencies.",

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "This is correct. Clients with CF have increased energy requirements due to the work of breathing, chronic infection, and malabsorption. A diet high in calories, protein, and fat (up to 150% of recommended daily allowances) is essential to maintain weight, support immune function, and promote healing during an exacerbation. **Pathophysiology:** The chronic inflammation and infection in the lungs, coupled with the increased work of breathing, significantly increase metabolic demands. Malabsorption further exacerbates the need for a high-calorie, high-protein, high-fat diet to prevent malnutrition and support immune function.",

        "content": "This is incorrect. While IV tobramycin is commonly used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF exacerbations, it is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that carries risks of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. To minimize these adverse effects, it must be infused slowly, typically over 30 to 60 minutes, not 15 minutes. **Pathophysiology:** Rapid infusion of aminoglycosides can lead to high peak serum concentrations, increasing the risk of drug accumulation in the inner ear and kidneys, causing damage to these organs.",

      {
        "label": "F",
        "content": "This is correct. Adequate hydration is critical for clients with CF. Increased fluid intake helps to decrease the viscosity (thin) of respiratory secretions, making them easier to mobilize and expectorate through coughing and CPT. Dehydration would lead to thicker, more obstructive mucus plugs. **Pathophysiology:** In CF, the defective CFTR protein leads to decreased water content in respiratory secretions, making them thick and tenacious. Adequate hydration helps to increase the water content, reducing viscosity and facilitating mucociliary clearance.",
