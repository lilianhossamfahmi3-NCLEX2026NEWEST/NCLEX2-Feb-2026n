The client's oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, which is below the target of >94% for a client experiencing a myocardial infarction. Administering supplemental oxygen will increase the oxygen available to the myocardium, reducing ischemia and potential tissue damage. Myocardial cells require adequate oxygen to function properly. Ischemia occurs when oxygen supply is insufficient to meet demand, leading to cellular dysfunction and potentially infarction (necrosis). Supplemental oxygen increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, enhancing oxygen diffusion into ischemic tissues. The tachycardia and tachypnea are compensatory mechanisms for myocardial ischemia and cellular hypoxia. Improving oxygenation reduces cardiac workload and prevents further ischemic damage.",
