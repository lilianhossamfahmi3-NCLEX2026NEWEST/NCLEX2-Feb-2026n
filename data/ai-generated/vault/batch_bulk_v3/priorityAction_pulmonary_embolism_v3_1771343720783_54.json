This is a life-threatening medical emergency. The nurse's immediate priorities are to support oxygenation and circulation (ABCs) and activate emergency assistance. Applying a non-rebreather mask addresses the critical hypoxemia (SpO2 87%). Placing the client in high-Fowler's position facilitates lung expansion and eases the work of breathing. Initiating the RRT is crucial because the client is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate advanced medical intervention beyond the scope of a single nurse.",

Administering morphine, a CNS depressant, is dangerous in a client with hypotension and respiratory distress as it can worsen both conditions. Sending for a D-dimer is a diagnostic measure and is secondary to life-saving interventions; stabilization is the priority. Encouraging the use of an incentive spirometer is inappropriate for a client in acute respiratory distress and would exacerbate their dyspnea.",
