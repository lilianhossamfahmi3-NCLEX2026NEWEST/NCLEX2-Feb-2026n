    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE), a life-threatening condition. The sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and hypoxemia strongly suggest PE. Post-operative patients are at increased risk due to Virchow's triad (stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial injury). The nurse's immediate priorities are to support oxygenation and circulation (ABCs) and activate emergency assistance. Applying a non-rebreather mask addresses the critical hypoxemia (SpO2 87%), aiming to increase oxygen delivery to tissues. Placing the client in high-Fowler's position facilitates lung expansion and reduces the work of breathing. Initiating the RRT ensures prompt evaluation and intervention by a multidisciplinary team, including potential thrombolytic therapy or surgical intervention.",
    "incorrect": "Administering morphine, a CNS depressant, is dangerous in a client with hypotension and respiratory distress as it can worsen both conditions. Sending for a D-dimer is a diagnostic measure and is secondary to life-saving interventions; stabilization is the priority. Encouraging the use of an incentive spirometer is inappropriate for a client in acute respiratory distress and would exacerbate their dyspnea.",

        "content": "Administer prescribed PRN morphine for chest pain.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Morphine, an opioid analgesic, can depress the respiratory drive and cause hypotension. In a client with tachypnea (RR 32), hypoxemia (SpO2 87%), and hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg), morphine could precipitate respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. The priority is to improve oxygenation and stabilize hemodynamics, not to mask the pain with a potentially dangerous medication. The underlying pathophysiology of PE involves obstruction of pulmonary arteries, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Morphine would worsen the hypoxemia by further depressing respiratory function."

        "content": "Position the client in high-Fowler's position.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct. Placing the client in high-Fowler's position maximizes lung expansion by reducing pressure on the diaphragm. This position uses gravity to facilitate diaphragmatic excursion and improve ventilation. By optimizing lung inflation, the client can improve gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing. In PE, the increased dead space and impaired gas exchange necessitate interventions that enhance ventilation. High-Fowler's is a simple, non-invasive method to achieve this."

        "content": "Send a blood sample for a D-dimer test.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect as an immediate priority. While a D-dimer test is used in the diagnostic workup for PE to assess for the presence of fibrin degradation products, it is not a therapeutic or life-saving intervention. A negative D-dimer can help rule out PE, but a positive result requires further investigation (e.g., CT angiography). The nurse's first responsibility is to stabilize the client by addressing the immediate threats to life (hypoxemia and respiratory distress), not to initiate diagnostic testing. The pathophysiology of PE involves thrombus formation and embolization to the pulmonary arteries. The D-dimer reflects the body's attempt to break down the clot, but it does not address the immediate respiratory compromise."

        "content": "Apply oxygen via a non-rebreather mask.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct and a highest priority. The client's SpO2 of 87% indicates significant hypoxemia, resulting from the ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by the pulmonary embolism. A non-rebreather mask delivers the highest concentration of oxygen via a non-invasive method (up to 90-95% FiO2), which is essential to correct tissue hypoxia and prevent further clinical deterioration. The goal is to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, thereby improving oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries and increasing arterial oxygen saturation. This directly addresses the impaired gas exchange caused by the PE."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "rationale": "Incorrect and potentially contraindicated. Incentive spirometry is a preventative measure for atelectasis and requires deep, controlled breathing. For a client in acute respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 32, this action is impossible to perform effectively and would significantly increase the work of breathing and patient anxiety. The client is already struggling to breathe, and forcing deep breaths could exacerbate their dyspnea and potentially lead to further respiratory compromise. The pathophysiology of PE involves obstruction of pulmonary arteries, leading to increased dead space and impaired gas exchange. Incentive spirometry does not address the underlying obstruction."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "rationale": "Correct and a critical priority. The client's combination of severe respiratory distress, hypotension, and tachycardia indicates hemodynamic instability consistent with a massive or submassive PE. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate, coordinated intervention from a specialized team to prevent cardiac arrest. The RRT can provide advanced respiratory support (e.g., intubation, mechanical ventilation), administer thrombolytic therapy, and prepare for potential surgical intervention (e.g., embolectomy). The pathophysiology of PE involves obstruction of pulmonary arteries, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular strain, and potentially cardiogenic shock. The RRT is essential to manage these complex physiological derangements."
