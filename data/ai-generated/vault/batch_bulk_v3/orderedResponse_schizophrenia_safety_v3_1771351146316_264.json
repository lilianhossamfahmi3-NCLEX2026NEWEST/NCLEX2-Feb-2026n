  "question": "A nurse is admitting a 28-year-old client with schizophrenia to an inpatient psychiatric unit. During the initial interview, the client reports, \"The voices are telling me I'm not safe and need to hurt myself before someone else does.\" The client is agitated, pacing, and glancing around fearfully. PRN olanzapine is prescribed. In what order should the nurse perform these actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

    "correct": "The priority is client safety. The correct order ensures immediate safety, assessment, pharmacological intervention, and therapeutic milieu orientation. One-to-one observation provides constant monitoring to prevent self-harm. Removing dangerous items eliminates means for self-injury. Assessing hallucination content helps understand specific risks. Administering PRN medication addresses psychotic symptoms. Orienting the client is effective once the acute crisis is managed. \n\n**SBAR:**\n*   **Situation:** 28-year-old with schizophrenia, command hallucinations to self-harm.\n*   **Background:** Admitting to inpatient unit, visibly agitated.\n*   **Assessment:** Reports voices, pacing, fearful.\n*   **Recommendation:** One-to-one observation, remove dangerous items, assess hallucinations, administer olanzapine, orient to unit.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Schizophrenia involves imbalances in neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, glutamate) affecting thought processes, perception, and behavior. Auditory hallucinations arise from abnormal brain activity in auditory and language processing areas. Command hallucinations are particularly dangerous, increasing the risk of self-harm or harm to others. Agitation is related to the psychosis and anxiety. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors, reducing psychotic symptoms and agitation.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Always prioritize safety when a client expresses command hallucinations. Document the specific content of the hallucinations, the client's behavior, and all interventions.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect orders prioritize less immediate interventions over the client's acute safety risk. Delaying observation, removal of dangerous items, or assessment of hallucinations leaves the client vulnerable. Unit orientation is ineffective during acute psychosis.",

        "content": "Place the client on one-to-one observation.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** This is the priority action due to the imminent risk of self-harm. Constant observation allows for immediate intervention to prevent the client from acting on the command hallucinations. This ensures continuous monitoring and safety."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Following observation, removing potential means of self-harm is crucial. This includes searching belongings and the client for sharp objects, ligatures, or other items that could be used to inflict injury. This step directly reduces the risk of self-harm."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** After ensuring immediate physical safety, a focused assessment is necessary. Understanding the specific content of the command hallucinations (e.g., what the voices are telling them to do, how powerful the voices are) is crucial for developing a specific safety plan and building therapeutic rapport. This informs further interventions."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** Once safety is addressed and assessment data is gathered, the antipsychotic medication should be administered. Olanzapine helps reduce the intensity of hallucinations and agitation, but it takes time to become effective. Therefore, it follows the initial safety and assessment interventions. Monitor for side effects such as sedation and orthostatic hypotension."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "**Rationale:** This is the lowest priority in this acute situation. While unit orientation is a standard part of admission, it is ineffective and inappropriate when a client is actively psychotic, agitated, and unable to process new information. This action should be deferred until the client is calmer and more stable. Focus on immediate safety and symptom management first."
