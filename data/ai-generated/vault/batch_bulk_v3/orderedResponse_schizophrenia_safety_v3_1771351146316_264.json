    "question": "A nurse in an inpatient psychiatric unit is admitting a 28-year-old client with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. During the initial interview, the client states, 'The voices are telling me I am not safe here and that I need to hurt myself before someone else does.' The client is visibly agitated, pacing, and glancing around the room fearfully. The healthcare provider has prescribed PRN olanzapine for agitation. The nurse must perform several actions. In what order should the nurse perform the following actions? Drag and drop the options into the correct sequence.",

        "correct": "The priority nursing action when a client with schizophrenia expresses command hallucinations to self-harm is to ensure immediate safety. The correct sequence of interventions follows the principle of safety first, followed by assessment, pharmacological intervention, and finally, therapeutic milieu orientation. First, initiating one-to-one observation provides constant monitoring to prevent self-harm. Second, removing any potentially dangerous items from the client and their belongings eliminates the means for self-injury. Third, further assessing the content of the hallucinations helps the nurse understand the specific risks and how to intervene verbally. Fourth, administering PRN medication addresses the underlying psychotic symptoms causing the distress. Lastly, orienting the client to the unit can only be effective once the acute crisis is managed and the client is calm enough to process information.",
        "incorrect": "Any other order of actions incorrectly prioritizes less immediate interventions over the client's acute safety risk. For example, administering medication or orienting the client to the unit before ensuring constant observation and removing dangerous objects leaves the client vulnerable to acting on the command hallucinations. Delaying assessment of the hallucinations' content delays understanding the specific threat. While all these actions are important parts of psychiatric nursing care, they must be sequenced according to the immediate risk to the client's life.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is the first and most critical action. The client has expressed command hallucinations to self-harm, representing an imminent safety risk. One-to-one observation ensures the client is never alone and that staff can intervene immediately to prevent any attempt at self-injury. This measure supersedes all other actions."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Immediately after establishing constant observation, the nurse must remove any means the client could use to harm themselves. This involves a search of the client's belongings and person for items such as sharp objects, belts, or shoelaces. This action directly reduces the client's ability to act on self-harm commands."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "Once immediate physical safety is established (observation and removal of dangerous items), the nurse should perform a focused assessment. Understanding the specific content of the command hallucinations (e.g., what the voices are telling them to do, how powerful the voices are) is crucial for developing a specific safety plan and building therapeutic rapport."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "After ensuring the client is physically safe and gathering more specific assessment data, the nurse should administer the antipsychotic medication. The medication will help reduce the intensity of the hallucinations and agitation, but it is not an immediate fix as it takes time to become effective. Therefore, it follows the initial safety and assessment interventions."

                "explanation": "This is the last priority in this acute situation. While unit orientation is a standard part of admission to reduce anxiety and establish routine, it is ineffective and inappropriate when a client is actively psychotic, agitated, and unable to process new information. This action should be deferred until the client is calmer and more stable."
