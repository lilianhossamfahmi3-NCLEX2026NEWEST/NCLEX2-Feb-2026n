The client is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, which requires the administration of rapid-acting IV antihypertensive medications to lower the blood pressure in a controlled manner.

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This is an incorrect action. Administering a fluid bolus would increase the intravascular volume, further elevating the client's already critically high blood pressure and worsening the hypertensive crisis. This action is contraindicated."

        "opt_03": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is a correct action. The extreme hypertension (224/130 mmHg) and tachycardia (110/min) place immense strain on the heart, increasing the risk for myocardial ischemia, infarction, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential for early detection of these complications."

        "opt_04": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This is an incorrect action. Oral medications have a slow and unpredictable onset of action, which is inappropriate for a hypertensive emergency. The goal is a controlled, gradual reduction of blood pressure using titratable IV medications, not a precipitous drop that could be caused by an oral agent."

        "opt_05": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is a correct action. The definitive treatment for hypertensive emergency is the use of IV antihypertensive agents (e.g., nicardipine, labetalol, sodium nitroprusside). The nurse must anticipate this order and prepare the medication and necessary infusion equipment to ensure timely administration."

        "opt_06": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This is an incorrect action. Ambulation is unsafe for a client with a blood pressure of 224/130 mmHg, blurred vision, and headache. The client is at high risk for syncope, falls, or cerebrovascular accident. Strict bed rest is indicated to decrease cardiac workload and ensure safety."

        "opt_07": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is a correct action. The client's symptoms of severe headache and blurred vision indicate end-organ damage to the central nervous system. Frequent neurological assessments (e.g., checking pupils, level of consciousness, motor function) are critical to monitor for any deterioration, such as signs of an evolving ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke."
