      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Establishing IV access is paramount in a hypertensive emergency. It allows for the rapid and controlled administration of IV antihypertensive medications, which are essential to lower the blood pressure quickly and safely. The goal is to reduce the mean arterial pressure (MAP) gradually to prevent complications such as cerebral hypoperfusion. Clinical Pearl: Use a large-bore IV catheter (18 gauge or larger) to facilitate rapid infusion if needed.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Use a large-bore IV catheter (18 gauge or larger) to facilitate rapid infusion if needed."
    },
    "opt_02": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering a rapid IV fluid bolus is contraindicated in this situation. The client's blood pressure is already critically elevated, and increasing the intravascular volume would further exacerbate the hypertension, potentially leading to pulmonary edema, heart failure, or increased intracranial pressure. Pathophysiology: Hypertensive crisis causes increased systemic vascular resistance and afterload. Adding fluid increases preload, overwhelming the already stressed heart.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Fluid boluses are generally avoided in hypertensive emergencies unless there is evidence of hypovolemia."
    },
    "opt_03": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. Continuous cardiac monitoring is crucial because the extreme hypertension places significant stress on the heart. This can lead to myocardial ischemia, infarction, or life-threatening arrhythmias. Monitoring allows for early detection and prompt treatment of any cardiac complications. Pathophysiology: High afterload increases myocardial oxygen demand. Pre-existing conditions like diabetes and CKD further compromise cardiac function.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor for signs of chest pain, ST-segment changes, or new arrhythmias."
    },
    "opt_04": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Oral antihypertensive medications are not appropriate for a hypertensive emergency. They have a slower onset of action and are less predictable in their effect compared to IV medications. The goal is to achieve a controlled and gradual reduction in blood pressure, which is best accomplished with titratable IV agents. Pathophysiology: Oral medications undergo first-pass metabolism, delaying their effect. In a hypertensive emergency, immediate BP control is vital.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Oral medications are typically resumed once the hypertensive emergency is controlled and the patient is stable."
    },
    "opt_05": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The definitive treatment for a hypertensive emergency involves the use of IV antihypertensive agents. Medications such as nicardipine, labetalol, or sodium nitroprusside are commonly used to rapidly lower blood pressure in a controlled manner. Preparing for administration ensures timely intervention. Pathophysiology: These drugs work by vasodilation, reducing systemic vascular resistance and lowering BP. The choice of agent depends on the specific clinical situation and presence of comorbidities.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Titrate IV antihypertensives carefully, monitoring BP every 5-15 minutes to avoid precipitous drops."
    },
    "opt_06": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Encouraging ambulation is unsafe and inappropriate. The client's severely elevated blood pressure, headache, and blurred vision put them at high risk for falls, syncope, or cerebrovascular accident. Strict bed rest is indicated to minimize cardiac workload and prevent injury. Pathophysiology: High BP can cause cerebral edema and increase the risk of stroke. Ambulation increases sympathetic tone, potentially worsening hypertension.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Maintain a quiet, low-stimulus environment to minimize anxiety and further BP elevation."
    },
    "opt_07": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client's headache and blurred vision suggest potential end-organ damage to the central nervous system. Frequent neurological assessments are essential to monitor for any deterioration, such as changes in level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor function, or signs of stroke. Pathophysiology: Hypertensive encephalopathy can cause cerebral edema, ischemia, or hemorrhage. Early detection of neurological changes is crucial for timely intervention.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Document neurological findings meticulously and report any changes immediately."

    "assessment": "Client is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, likely due to medication non-compliance. Elevated BP poses risk for stroke, MI, and kidney damage. Requires immediate intervention to lower BP safely and monitor for end-organ damage.",
    "recommendation": "0900: Obtain IV access, initiate continuous cardiac monitoring, prepare IV antihypertensive (e.g., nicardipine) per protocol. Perform neurological assessments q15 minutes. Anticipate orders for diagnostic tests (e.g., CT scan of head, EKG, labs). Strict bed rest. Notify provider immediately with changes in neurological status or vital signs."
