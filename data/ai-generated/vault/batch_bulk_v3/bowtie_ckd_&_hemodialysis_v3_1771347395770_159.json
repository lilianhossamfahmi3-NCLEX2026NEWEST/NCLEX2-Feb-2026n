Based on the client's presentation and diagnostic data, what is the most likely condition the client is experiencing, what are the two most appropriate actions for the nurse to take, and what are the two parameters the nurse should monitor to assess for improvement or deterioration?

The cluster of cues—including bibasilar crackles, jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, severe hypertension, dyspnea, and a highly elevated BNP—all point to fluid volume overload as the primary condition. The most appropriate immediate actions are to place the client in a high-Fowler's position to ease the work of breathing and reduce preload, and to prepare for emergent hemodialysis, which is the definitive treatment to remove excess fluid and correct electrolyte imbalances. Given the critical hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L) evidenced by peaked T-waves, monitoring the cardiac rhythm for lethal dysrhythmias is a top priority. Concurrently, monitoring breath sounds is essential to assess for worsening pulmonary edema and impending respiratory failure.",
        "incorrect": "Other conditions are less likely. Acute Coronary Syndrome is ruled out by the negative troponin. Hypertensive crisis is present but is a symptom of the fluid overload, not the root cause. Pneumonia is unlikely without a fever or other signs of infection. Anaphylaxis is inconsistent with the presentation. Incorrect actions would include administering fluids, which would worsen the overload, or giving labetalol without addressing the fluid, which could reduce cardiac output in the face of acute heart failure. Administering oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate is too slow for life-threatening hyperkalemia. Monitoring urine output is not a priority in a client with ESRD who is likely anuric. Peripheral edema and temperature are not acute indicators of decompensation in this scenario.",
