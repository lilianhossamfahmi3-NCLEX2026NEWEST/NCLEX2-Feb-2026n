    "stem": "A 45-year-old client diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is being monitored in the intensive care unit. The nurse notes the client's ascending paralysis has now reached the level of the diaphragm. The client appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Vital signs are: heart rate 52/min, blood pressure 168/98 mmHg, respiratory rate 28/min and shallow, and SpO2 91% on room air. Which actions should the nurse take? Select all that apply.",

        "correct": "The correct actions focus on managing the life-threatening complications of Guillain-Barre syndrome: respiratory failure and autonomic dysfunction. The client's use of accessory muscles, shallow respirations, diaphragmatic paralysis, and SpO2 of 91% indicate impending respiratory failure, making preparation for intubation the highest priority. The bradycardia (HR 52) and hypertension (BP 168/98) are signs of autonomic dysfunction, requiring continuous cardiac monitoring to detect lethal arrhythmias. As the paralysis ascends, cranial nerve involvement (IX, X) is common, so assessing the gag reflex is crucial to prevent aspiration. Finally, establishing a communication method is a vital intervention as the client may soon be unable to speak due to paralysis and intubation.",
        "incorrect": "Administering a sedative is contraindicated as it can suppress the respiratory drive in a client who is already in respiratory distress. The client's anxiety is due to air hunger (hypoxia), and the underlying respiratory issue must be addressed first. Placing the client supine would further compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of aspiration. The head of the bed should be elevated. Corticosteroids have not been found to be effective in treating GBS and are not a recommended therapy.",
