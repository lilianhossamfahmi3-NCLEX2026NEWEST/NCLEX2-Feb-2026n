The nurse notes the client's ascending paralysis has now reached the level of the diaphragm. The client appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Vital signs are: heart rate 52/min, blood pressure 168/98 mmHg, respiratory rate 28/min and shallow, and SpO2 91% on room air. Which actions should the nurse take? Select all that apply.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of respiratory distress and autonomic dysfunction secondary to GBS. Prioritize interventions to support respiratory function and manage cardiovascular instability. Assessing gag reflex (Option B) is crucial due to the risk of bulbar muscle weakness and aspiration. Continuous cardiac monitoring (Option C) is essential to detect and manage arrhythmias associated with autonomic dysfunction. Preparing for elective intubation (Option E) is indicated due to impending respiratory failure. Establishing a communication method (Option F) is vital as the client's ability to speak may be compromised. \n\n**Pathophysiology:** GBS is an autoimmune disorder causing demyelination of peripheral nerves. Ascending paralysis can affect respiratory muscles (diaphragm) leading to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Autonomic dysfunction can manifest as bradycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmias due to impaired regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Early recognition of respiratory compromise in GBS is critical. Proactive intubation can prevent respiratory arrest and improve outcomes.",
    "incorrect": "Administering a sedative (Option A) is contraindicated as it can further depress respiratory drive. Placing the client supine (Option D) worsens respiratory distress. Corticosteroids (Option G) are not effective in treating GBS.\n\n**Pathophysiology:** Sedatives depress the central nervous system, further reducing respiratory effort. Supine positioning restricts diaphragmatic movement, exacerbating dyspnea. Corticosteroids have not demonstrated benefit in GBS and may prolong recovery.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Anxiety in GBS is often related to air hunger. Addressing the underlying respiratory issue is the priority, rather than administering sedatives.",
