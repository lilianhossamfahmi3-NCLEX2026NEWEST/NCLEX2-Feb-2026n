    "correct": "The client's statement indicates command hallucinations, a high-risk situation requiring immediate intervention to ensure safety.\n\n*   **Initiate continuous one-to-one observation (+):** This provides constant monitoring to prevent the client from acting on the commands, reducing the risk of self-harm or harm to others. Continuous observation allows for immediate intervention if the client's behavior escalates.\n*   **Administer a prescribed PRN dose of olanzapine (+):** Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, helps to reduce psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations. By reducing the intensity of the hallucinations, the risk of the client acting on the commands decreases. The medication works by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain, which are implicated in psychosis.\n*   **Ask the client directly what the voices are saying (+):** Assessing the specific content of the command hallucinations is crucial for determining the level and nature of the risk. Understanding the commands helps the nurse anticipate potential behaviors and implement appropriate safety measures. This also demonstrates to the client that the nurse is taking their concerns seriously.\n*   **Remove items like shoelaces and belts from the client's belongings (+):** This is a standard safety precaution to minimize the risk of self-harm. Removing potential ligatures reduces the opportunity for the client to attempt suicide by strangulation.",
    "incorrect": "*   **Reassure the client that the voices are not real (-):** This approach is non-therapeutic and can damage the therapeutic relationship. Clients experiencing hallucinations perceive them as real, and directly challenging this perception can increase their anxiety and agitation. Instead, the nurse should acknowledge the client's experience without validating the hallucination.\n*   **Place the client in a private room at the end of the hallway for privacy (-):** This increases the client's isolation and reduces the ability of staff to monitor them closely. Clients at risk for self-harm or violence require close observation and easy access to staff intervention. A room closer to the nursing station is more appropriate.",
