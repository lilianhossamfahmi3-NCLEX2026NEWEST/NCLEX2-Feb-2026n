At 1330, during the admission assessment, the client became visibly distressed, stating, 'The voices are telling me to do bad things.' He is guarded, pacing, and exhibiting paranoid ideation.\nBackground: The client has a 5-year history of schizophrenia with multiple prior hospitalizations for medication non-adherence. He has been living in a temporary shelter for the past month, which he reports has increased his stress and contributed to this relapse. His outpatient psychiatrist referred him due to escalating paranoia and auditory hallucinations. He has a past self-harm attempt by ligature two years ago.\nAssessment: The client is experiencing command auditory hallucinations, placing him at imminent risk for self-harm or other-directed violence. Vital signs show mild tachycardia. He is alert but not oriented to the situation. His thought process is disorganized.\nRecommendation: Immediately implement one-to-one observation. Assess the specific content of the command hallucinations. Administer PRN olanzapine as ordered to target acute psychotic symptoms. Initiate a contraband search and remove all potentially dangerous items. Maintain a safe, low-stimulus environment.",

Client reports feeling 'stressed' and 'unsafe' at the shelter. Denies suicidal ideation at this time but is difficult to assess fully due to paranoia. Placed on standard unit precautions pending full psychiatric evaluation.\n\nProgress Note\n1330: During admission assessment in the interview room, client stood up abruptly and began pacing. Stated, 'The voices are telling me to do bad things.' Client is unable to elaborate further, appears frightened. Affect is labile, shifting from anxious to irritable. Actively responding to internal stimuli. Provider notified of acute change in status. Immediate safety interventions required due to emergence of command hallucinations and increased agitation."
