        "correct": "The priority for a client experiencing command hallucinations is safety. The nurse must assess the nature of the commands, provide constant supervision to prevent harm, reduce environmental risks, and administer medication to target the underlying psychotic symptoms. Directly asking about the content of the hallucinations is a critical risk assessment step. One-to-one observation is the standard of care for a client with active suicidal or homicidal ideation. Administering a PRN antipsychotic can help reduce the intensity of the symptoms. Removing potentially dangerous items from the client's environment is a crucial proactive safety measure.",
        "incorrect": "Challenging the client's perception of reality by stating the voices are not real is non-therapeutic and can increase agitation and damage the therapeutic alliance. Isolating the client in a room far from the nursing station decreases the ability for staff to observe and intervene quickly, posing a significant safety risk. The nurse should instead focus on the client's feelings and ensuring safety without invalidating their experience.",
