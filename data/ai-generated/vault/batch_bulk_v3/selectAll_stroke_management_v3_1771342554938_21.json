        "correct": "The correct nursing interventions following alteplase administration for an ischemic stroke focus on monitoring for complications, controlling blood pressure, and optimizing cerebral perfusion. This includes frequent neurologic assessments (every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours) to detect early signs of intracranial hemorrhage or neurological decline. Strict blood pressure control (keeping SBP <180 mmHg and DBP <105 mmHg) is critical to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Maintaining the head of the bed flat (or <30 degrees) is often recommended to enhance blood flow to the ischemic penumbra, assuming there are no contraindications like aspiration risk or respiratory distress.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that increase the risk of bleeding or other complications are contraindicated. Administration of anticoagulants like enoxaparin within 24 hours of tPA is contraindicated due to the high risk of severe bleeding. Similarly, invasive procedures such as inserting a urinary catheter should be avoided to prevent bleeding. Encouraging oral intake is unsafe until a swallow screen is performed to assess for dysphagia and prevent aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of stroke.",
