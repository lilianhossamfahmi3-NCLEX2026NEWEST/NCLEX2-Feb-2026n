    "correct": "Following alteplase administration for acute ischemic stroke, the priority is to monitor for complications, control blood pressure, and optimize cerebral perfusion. \n\n**A:** Frequent neurological assessments (every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly for 16 hours) are crucial to detect early signs of intracranial hemorrhage or neurological decline. This includes assessing level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor strength, and sensory function using a standardized scale like the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS).\n\n**D:** Strict blood pressure control (maintaining SBP <180 mmHg and DBP <105 mmHg) is critical to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Alteplase can weaken the blood-brain barrier, making it more susceptible to bleeding under high pressure.\n\n**F:** Maintaining the head of the bed flat (or <30 degrees) is often recommended to enhance cerebral perfusion to the ischemic penumbra, the area of potentially salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct. This position maximizes cerebral blood flow, assuming there are no contraindications like increased intracranial pressure, aspiration risk, or respiratory distress.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Report any sudden change in neurological status (e.g., increased weakness, severe headache, vomiting) immediately to the healthcare provider.",
    "incorrect": "Interventions that increase the risk of bleeding or other complications are contraindicated after alteplase administration.\n\n**B:** Administration of anticoagulants like enoxaparin within 24 hours of tPA is contraindicated due to the high risk of severe bleeding. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that dissolves clots, and adding an anticoagulant further increases the risk of hemorrhage.\n\n**C:** Invasive procedures such as inserting a urinary catheter should be avoided unless absolutely necessary to prevent bleeding. Trauma from catheter insertion can cause hematuria and increase the risk of infection. A condom catheter or intermittent catheterization is a safer alternative if urinary retention is a concern.\n\n**E:** Encouraging oral intake is unsafe until a swallow screen is performed to assess for dysphagia and prevent aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of stroke. Dysphagia can lead to food or liquids entering the lungs, causing a potentially life-threatening infection.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in stroke patients. Always ensure a swallow evaluation is completed before initiating oral intake.",
