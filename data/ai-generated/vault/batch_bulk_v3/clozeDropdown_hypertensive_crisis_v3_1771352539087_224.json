    "answerBreakdown": {
        "1": {
            "1A": "Incorrect. A rapid-acting oral antihypertensive (e.g., nifedipine sublingual) is not recommended because its absorption and effect are unpredictable, which can lead to a precipitous drop in blood pressure, causing cerebral ischemia.",
            "1B": "Correct. In a hypertensive emergency (crisis with end-organ damage, evidenced by confusion and blurred vision), a continuous IV antihypertensive infusion (e.g., nicardipine, labetalol) is the standard of care. This allows for precise, titratable control over the rate of blood pressure reduction, which is critical to prevent further organ damage.",
            "1C": "Incorrect. While diuretics are used in long-term hypertension management, an oral diuretic is not the primary intervention for an acute hypertensive emergency. Its onset is too slow, and it does not provide the controlled reduction needed.",
            "1D": "Incorrect. A long-acting oral beta-blocker is inappropriate for an emergency. The onset of action is too slow, and it cannot be titrated to achieve the specific, controlled blood pressure reduction goals required in this acute setting."
        },
        "2": {
            "2A": "Correct. The primary therapeutic goal in a hypertensive emergency is to lower the mean arterial pressure (MAP) cautiously by 10-20% in the first hour, and by a total of no more than 25% by the end of the first hour. This controlled reduction prevents cerebral, coronary, or renal hypoperfusion that can result from lowering the BP too rapidly.",
            "2B": "Incorrect. Reducing the systolic BP to below 140 mmHg within 30 minutes is too aggressive and dangerous. Such a rapid decrease can compromise cerebral autoregulation, leading to ischemic stroke, especially in a patient with chronic hypertension whose body has adapted to a higher baseline pressure.",
            "2C": "Incorrect. While the diastolic pressure is very high, the goal is not to lower it to a specific number as quickly as possible. The focus is on a controlled, percentage-based reduction of the overall MAP to prevent hypoperfusion injury.",
            "2D": "Incorrect. Normalizing the blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg within two hours is also too rapid and aggressive. The goal is a gradual reduction over 24-48 hours after the initial controlled drop in the first hour."
        },
        "3": {
            "3A": "Incorrect. While monitoring urine output is important to assess for renal end-organ damage (acute kidney injury), the client's presenting symptoms of headache, blurred vision, and confusion make neurological status the immediate priority.",
            "3B": "Incorrect. Serial cardiac enzymes would be a priority if the client presented with chest pain or EKG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia. While a hypertensive crisis can cause cardiac damage, it is not the most immediate concern based on the current clinical presentation.",
            "3C": "Correct. The client is showing clear signs of hypertensive encephalopathy (severe headache, blurred vision, confusion). The most critical ongoing assessment is frequent neurological checks (e.g., using the Glasgow Coma Scale, assessing pupillary response, motor function) to monitor for improvement or deterioration, which could indicate worsening encephalopathy or stroke.",
            "3D": "Incorrect. Assessment of peripheral edema is related to fluid status and potential heart failure, but it is not the priority assessment in a patient with acute neurological symptoms secondary to a hypertensive emergency."
        },
        "4": {
            "4A": "Incorrect. An automatic BP cuff, even cycling frequently, is less accurate than an arterial line, especially in a patient who may be agitated or moving. Inaccurate readings can lead to improper titration of potent IV medications, causing dangerous swings in blood pressure.",
            "4B": "Correct. An intra-arterial line provides continuous, real-time, beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement. This is the gold standard for monitoring in a hypertensive emergency because it allows for the most accurate and immediate feedback, which is essential for safely titrating IV antihypertensive infusions.",
            "4C": "Incorrect. A central venous pressure (CVP) monitor measures right atrial pressure, which reflects fluid volume status and right ventricular preload. It does not measure systemic arterial blood pressure and is not the appropriate tool for this purpose.",
            "4D": "Incorrect. Manual blood pressure checks every 15 minutes are not frequent enough to safely manage a continuous infusion of a potent vasoactive medication. The blood pressure can change rapidly, and more frequent, continuous monitoring is required."
