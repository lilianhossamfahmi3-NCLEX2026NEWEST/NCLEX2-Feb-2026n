The MAP has fallen from 90 mmHg to 67 mmHg, indicating inadequate organ perfusion. The urine output has dropped from 50 mL/hr to 15 mL/hr, signifying oliguria and acute kidney injury due to poor perfusion. These findings are classic signs of developing cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening complication of MI where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.",
        "incorrect": "While other findings require monitoring, they are either expected or not as immediately life-threatening as the signs of cardiogenic shock. The rise in troponin is an expected finding as the enzyme 'washes out' from the damaged myocardium after reperfusion. Increasing PVCs are common post-MI but are less concerning than systemic hypoperfusion unless they progress to sustained ventricular tachycardia. Mild groin discomfort and ecchymosis are expected at the access site and do not indicate a major bleed without a rapidly expanding hematoma or signs of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.",

After a successful PCI, reperfusion of the ischemic heart muscle causes a 'washout' of cardiac enzymes, leading to a rise and subsequent peak in troponin levels within 12-24 hours.
