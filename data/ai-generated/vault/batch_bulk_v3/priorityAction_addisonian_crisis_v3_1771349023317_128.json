Administering hydrocortisone is the priority to reverse the shock state."

The client is exhibiting classic signs of an Addisonian crisis (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status), which is a life-threatening emergency caused by acute adrenal insufficiency. The absolute priority is to immediately replace the deficient glucocorticoid (cortisol) by administering IV hydrocortisone. This action is crucial for restoring vascular tone, stabilizing blood pressure, normalizing blood glucose, and aiding in the correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances."
