This is a life-threatening emergency due to acute adrenal insufficiency. The priority is immediate glucocorticoid replacement with IV hydrocortisone. Pathophysiology: Addison's disease results in insufficient cortisol production. Cortisol is vital for maintaining vascular tone, regulating glucose levels, and modulating the inflammatory response. Its deficiency leads to vasodilation, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Hydrocortisone restores vascular tone, increases blood pressure, normalizes blood glucose, and helps correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Clinical Pearl: In Addisonian crisis, immediate hydrocortisone administration is life-saving.",
