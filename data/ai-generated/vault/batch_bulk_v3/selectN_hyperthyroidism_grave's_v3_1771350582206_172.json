The client appears anxious and reports recent weight loss despite an increased appetite, palpitations, and difficulty sleeping. The healthcare provider prescribes methimazole and propranolol. The nurse is providing discharge education."

Methimazole, an antithyroid medication, carries a risk of agranulocytosis, a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by a severe drop in white blood cells. Fever and a sore throat are early signs of this complication. Immediate reporting is crucial for client safety to allow for prompt medical evaluation and intervention."

            {
                "key": "opt_2",
                "rationale": "Correct. Grave's disease causes a hypermetabolic state, leading to rapid calorie expenditure, protein breakdown, and weight loss. A diet high in calories (4000-5000 kcal/day), protein, and carbohydrates is essential to meet the body's increased metabolic demands, prevent tissue wasting, and restore nutritional balance."

                "key": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Correct. Graves' ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos) is common and can cause corneal dryness, irritation, and photophobia due to incomplete eyelid closure. Lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) protect the cornea, while dark glasses reduce discomfort from light sensitivity and protect the eyes from debris."

            {
                "key": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Correct. The effectiveness of antithyroid medication must be closely monitored to ensure the client reaches a euthyroid state without becoming hypothyroid. Regular monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels is necessary to titrate the medication dosage appropriately."

            {
                "key": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Iodine is a primary substrate for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Increasing iodine intake would worsen hyperthyroidism by providing more raw material for the overactive thyroid gland to produce hormones."

            {
                "key": "opt_6",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's hypermetabolic state already places significant strain on the cardiovascular system, causing tachycardia and palpitations. Vigorous exercise is contraindicated as it would further increase cardiac workload and could precipitate complications like atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Rest is encouraged until thyroid levels are stabilized."

            {
                "key": "opt_7",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. Methimazole works by inhibiting the production of new thyroid hormones and must be taken consistently on a prescribed schedule to maintain stable therapeutic levels. It is not a PRN medication used for acute symptom relief. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is often prescribed for symptomatic control of palpitations and tremors."

            {
                "key": "opt_8",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The primary nutritional goal is to combat the weight loss caused by the hypermetabolic state. A low-calorie diet would be detrimental, exacerbating malnutrition and muscle wasting. Weight gain is an expected and desired outcome of successful treatment, indicating that the metabolic rate is normalizing."
