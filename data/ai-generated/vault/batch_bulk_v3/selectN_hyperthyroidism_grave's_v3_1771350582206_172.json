      {
        "key": "opt_1",
        "rationale": "Correct. Methimazole, an antithyroid medication, carries a risk of agranulocytosis, a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by a severe drop in white blood cells. Fever and a sore throat are early signs of this complication. Immediate reporting is crucial for client safety to allow for prompt medical evaluation and intervention."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. Grave's disease causes a hypermetabolic state, leading to rapid calorie expenditure, protein breakdown, and weight loss. A diet high in calories (4000-5000 kcal/day), protein, and carbohydrates is essential to meet the body's increased metabolic demands, prevent tissue wasting, and restore nutritional balance."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_3",
        "rationale": "Correct. Graves' ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos) is common and can cause corneal dryness, irritation, and photophobia due to incomplete eyelid closure. Lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) protect the cornea, while dark glasses reduce discomfort from light sensitivity and protect the eyes from debris."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Correct. The effectiveness of antithyroid medication must be closely monitored to ensure the client reaches a euthyroid state without becoming hypothyroid. Regular monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels is necessary to titrate the medication dosage appropriately."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Iodine is a primary substrate for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Increasing iodine intake would worsen hyperthyroidism by providing more raw material for the overactive thyroid gland to produce hormones."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_6",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The client's hypermetabolic state already places significant strain on the cardiovascular system, causing tachycardia and palpitations. Vigorous exercise is contraindicated as it would further increase cardiac workload and could precipitate complications like atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Rest is encouraged until thyroid levels are stabilized."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_7",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Methimazole works by inhibiting the production of new thyroid hormones and must be taken consistently on a prescribed schedule to maintain stable therapeutic levels. It is not a PRN medication used for acute symptom relief. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is often prescribed for symptomatic control of palpitations and tremors."
      },
      {
        "key": "opt_8",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. The primary nutritional goal is to combat the weight loss caused by the hypermetabolic state. A low-calorie diet would be detrimental, exacerbating malnutrition and muscle wasting. Weight gain is an expected and desired outcome of successful treatment, indicating that the metabolic rate is normalizing."

  "scoring": {
    "opt_1": {
      "score": 1,
      "rationale": "Correct. Methimazole can cause agranulocytosis, a dangerous drop in white blood cells, increasing infection risk. Fever and sore throat are early signs. Prompt reporting allows for immediate CBC testing and intervention to prevent severe complications. ClinicalPearl: Teach patients on antithyroid drugs to report signs of infection immediately."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "score": 1,
      "rationale": "Correct. Hyperthyroidism increases metabolism, leading to rapid calorie and protein expenditure. A high-calorie (4000-5000 kcal/day), high-protein diet combats weight loss and prevents muscle wasting. Carbohydrates provide energy. ClinicalPearl: Frequent, small meals can help manage increased appetite and prevent discomfort.",
      "pathophysiology": "In hyperthyroidism, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) stimulate metabolic processes in nearly all tissues. This leads to increased oxygen consumption, heat production, and catabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The body's energy demands are significantly elevated, resulting in weight loss despite increased appetite."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "score": 1,
      "rationale": "Correct. Graves' ophthalmopathy causes exophthalmos (protruding eyes), leading to corneal dryness, irritation, and photophobia. Lubricating eye drops protect the cornea, and dark glasses reduce light sensitivity. ClinicalPearl: Elevate the head of the bed at night to reduce periorbital edema.",
      "pathophysiology": "Graves' ophthalmopathy is an autoimmune process where antibodies target tissues behind the eye, causing inflammation and swelling of the extraocular muscles and fatty tissue. This pushes the eyeball forward, leading to incomplete eyelid closure and corneal exposure."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "score": 1,
      "rationale": "Correct. Regular blood tests (TSH, Free T4) are crucial to monitor methimazole's effectiveness and prevent hypothyroidism. Dosage adjustments are based on these results. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize the importance of adherence to blood test schedule, even if feeling well.",
      "pathophysiology": "Methimazole inhibits thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. Monitoring TSH and Free T4 levels allows clinicians to assess the degree of thyroid hormone suppression and adjust the methimazole dosage to maintain a euthyroid state. Overtreatment can lead to iatrogenic hypothyroidism."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "score": -1,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Iodine is a building block for thyroid hormones. Increased iodine intake worsens hyperthyroidism by providing more substrate for hormone production. ClinicalPearl: Advise against iodine-rich foods and supplements.",
      "pathophysiology": "Iodine is actively transported into thyroid follicular cells, where it is incorporated into thyroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). These are then coupled to form T3 and T4. Increased iodine availability accelerates this process, exacerbating hyperthyroidism."
    },
    "opt_6": {
      "score": -1,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Hyperthyroidism already strains the cardiovascular system. Vigorous exercise increases cardiac workload and can precipitate complications like atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Rest is encouraged until thyroid levels stabilize. ClinicalPearl: Encourage gentle activities like walking once symptoms are controlled.",
      "pathophysiology": "Excess thyroid hormones increase heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. This places a significant burden on the cardiovascular system, potentially leading to arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased oxygen demand. Vigorous exercise further exacerbates these effects."
    },
    "opt_7": {
      "score": -1,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Methimazole must be taken consistently as prescribed to maintain stable therapeutic levels. It's not a PRN medication for acute symptom relief. Propranolol is used for symptomatic control of palpitations and tremors. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize the importance of medication adherence for optimal thyroid control.",
      "pathophysiology": "Methimazole has a relatively short half-life and requires consistent administration to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the bloodstream. Intermittent use allows thyroid hormone synthesis to rebound, leading to fluctuations in thyroid hormone levels and persistent hyperthyroid symptoms."
    },
    "opt_8": {
      "score": -1,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. The goal is to combat weight loss. A low-calorie diet exacerbates malnutrition and muscle wasting. Weight gain is expected and desired as the metabolic rate normalizes. ClinicalPearl: Focus on nutrient-dense foods to support weight gain and overall health.",
      "pathophysiology": "The hypermetabolic state in hyperthyroidism leads to increased catabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. A low-calorie diet further restricts energy intake, exacerbating the negative energy balance and hindering tissue repair and growth."
