        "correct": "The correct actions address the client's life-threatening hypoxemia (PaO2 58, SpO2 86%), respiratory acidosis, ventilator dyssynchrony, and hemodynamic instability, which are hallmarks of severe ARDS. Administering an NMBA will improve ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen consumption. Initiating a vasopressor is crucial to correct the hypotension (BP 88/50) and maintain organ perfusion. Prone positioning is a key evidence-based intervention for severe ARDS to improve ventilation-perfusion matching. Titrating FiO2 to 100% is a necessary immediate step to correct profound hypoxemia.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect actions would either worsen the client's condition or violate the standards of care for ARDS. Increasing tidal volume would cause further lung injury (volutrauma). Decreasing PEEP would lead to alveolar collapse (atelectasis) and worsen hypoxemia. Routine hourly suctioning is not indicated and can cause desaturation and tracheal trauma; suctioning should be based on assessment findings.",

This increases work of breathing and oxygen consumption, worsening gas exchange. A neuromuscular blocking agent paralyzes the client, allowing the ventilator to take full control, which improves synchrony, reduces oxygen demand, and can improve oxygenation.",

A core principle of ARDS management is a lung-protective ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) to prevent barotrauma and volutrauma in stiff, non-compliant lungs.
