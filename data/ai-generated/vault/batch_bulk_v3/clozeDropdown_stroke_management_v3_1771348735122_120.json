An IV infusion of alteplase (tPA) was initiated 30 minutes ago per protocol. The nurse is performing a scheduled assessment and notes the client is now reporting a mild headache. Vital signs are: blood pressure 190/105 mm Hg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 98.9°F (37.2°C). \n\nBased on the client's new findings, the nurse should first recognize the potential for **[BLANK_1]** and then prioritize **[BLANK_2]**.",

The combination of a new headache and a significant increase in blood pressure in a client receiving alteplase are classic signs of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

The hypertension is most likely a secondary effect of increasing intracranial pressure from a hemorrhage (Cushing's response), not the root cause of the client's change in condition."

This action prevents further bleeding. Immediately afterward, the provider must be notified to obtain orders for an emergent non-contrast head CT and other interventions."

The hypertension is likely a symptom of ICH, and while it needs management, the priority is to stop the bleeding. The provider must be notified before administering any new medications."

While neurological assessments are vital, taking the time to perform a detailed assessment delays the most critical intervention: stopping the alteplase infusion. A brief, focused assessment can be done, but stopping the infusion and notifying the provider are the immediate priorities."
