An IV infusion of alteplase (tPA) was initiated 30 minutes ago per protocol. The nurse is performing a scheduled assessment and notes the client is now reporting a mild headache. Vital signs are: blood pressure 190/105 mm Hg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 98.9°F (37.2°C). \n\nBased on the client's new findings, the nurse should first recognize the potential for **[BLANK_1]** and then prioritize **[BLANK_2]**.",

            "correct": true,
            "rationale": "Correct. The combination of a new headache and a significant increase in blood pressure in a client receiving alteplase are concerning for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, dissolves clots but carries the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain. The elevated blood pressure further increases this risk.  ICH occurs when blood vessels in the brain rupture, leading to bleeding into the brain tissue. This can cause increased intracranial pressure, neurological damage, and potentially death.  Prompt recognition is crucial for timely intervention to minimize brain damage. Clinical Pearl: Any new neurological symptom, especially headache, in a patient receiving thrombolytics should be immediately investigated for ICH."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. While an allergic reaction to alteplase is possible, it typically presents with symptoms such as urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), bronchospasm (difficulty breathing), or hypotension (low blood pressure). The client's symptoms of headache and hypertension are more indicative of ICH. Clinical Pearl: Always consider the most life-threatening complication first. Allergic reactions are serious but generally develop differently than ICH."

            "rationale": "Incorrect. Reocclusion of the cerebral artery would likely manifest as a worsening of the initial focal neurological deficits (e.g., increased weakness, aphasia, visual changes). While blood pressure may fluctuate with reocclusion, the new onset of a headache, especially with elevated blood pressure, is more specific to a bleed. Clinical Pearl: Reocclusion typically presents with a return or worsening of the original stroke symptoms."

            "correct": false,
            "rationale": "Incorrect. Although the blood pressure is elevated, labeling this as a primary hypertensive crisis is less accurate than suspecting ICH. The hypertension is most likely a secondary effect of increasing intracranial pressure from a hemorrhage (Cushing's reflex), not the primary cause of the client's change in condition. Cushing's reflex is a physiological nervous system response to increased intracranial pressure that results in hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration. Clinical Pearl: Consider secondary causes of hypertension in patients with neurological changes."

            "rationale": "Correct. Given the high suspicion for ICH, the first priority is to stop the infusion of alteplase immediately. This action prevents further bleeding into the brain tissue.  Alteplase has a short half-life, so stopping the infusion rapidly reduces its thrombolytic effect.  Immediately after stopping the infusion, notify the provider to obtain orders for an emergent non-contrast head CT scan to confirm or rule out ICH. Other potential interventions include administering protamine sulfate (to reverse heparin, if used), managing blood pressure, and preparing for potential neurosurgical intervention. Clinical Pearl: Time is brain. Rapid intervention is critical in suspected ICH to minimize neurological damage. SBAR: Situation: 68-year-old client post-alteplase with new headache and elevated BP. Background: Admitted for acute ischemic stroke, alteplase started 30 minutes ago. Assessment: BP 190/105, HR 92, RR 18, T 98.9°F, reporting headache. Recommendation: Stop alteplase infusion immediately and notify provider for emergent CT scan order. (Time: 1430)"

            "rationale": "Incorrect. Administering an antihypertensive medication without first stopping the alteplase infusion is unsafe. The hypertension is likely a symptom of ICH and a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. While blood pressure management is important in ICH, the priority is to stop the bleeding first. The provider must be notified before administering any new medications, especially antihypertensives, as overly aggressive blood pressure reduction can worsen cerebral ischemia. Clinical Pearl: Lowering blood pressure too quickly in the setting of ICH can be detrimental."

A brief, focused assessment can be done to assess the client's level of consciousness, pupillary response, and motor function, but stopping the infusion and notifying the provider are the immediate priorities. Clinical Pearl: Prioritize interventions based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and the severity of the situation."

Treating the symptom with an analgesic is not the priority and would delay the urgent actions needed to address the underlying cause. Furthermore, some analgesics, such as NSAIDs, can increase the risk of bleeding. Clinical Pearl: Treat the cause, not just the symptom, especially in acute situations."
