        "correct": "The client's presentation of lethargy, shallow respirations, accessory muscle use, and hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) strongly indicates impending respiratory failure. The primary problem in late-stage DMD is progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles, leading to alveolar hypoventilation and retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). This is exacerbated by a minor illness like a cold. Therefore, the client is developing hypercapnic respiratory failure. The priority action is to support ventilation immediately with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), such as BiPAP. This intervention decreases the work of breathing, improves gas exchange, and can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation. After initiating NIPPV, the nurse must closely monitor parameters that reflect the client's ventilatory and neurological status. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results provide a direct measurement of oxygenation (PaO2) and ventilation (PaCO2). The level of consciousness is a critical indicator of worsening hypercapnia (CO2 narcosis). The effectiveness of the client's cough is also vital to monitor, as inability to clear secretions is a major contributor to respiratory complications; interventions like cough-assist may be needed in conjunction with NIPPV.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect choices for the 'Action to Take' do not address the primary problem of ventilatory failure. A fluid bolus is for hypovolemia, not respiratory distress. Obtaining a sputum culture is important but not the immediate life-saving priority. A bronchodilator is for bronchospasm, which is not the root cause of the client's distress. High-Fowler's position helps with oxygenation but is insufficient alone for muscle fatigue and hypoventilation. For 'Potential Condition', other choices are less likely. While pneumonia may be a trigger, the overarching physiological state is respiratory failure due to muscle weakness. There are no clear signs of septic shock (e.g., hypotension) or decompensated heart failure (e.g., severe edema, JVD). For 'Parameters to Monitor', urine output and cardiac enzymes are not direct indicators of respiratory status in this acute scenario.",
