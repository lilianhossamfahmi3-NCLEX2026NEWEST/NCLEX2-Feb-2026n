    "correct": "The client's presentation (paranoia, agitation, threatening behavior, elevated vital signs) strongly suggests an acute psychotic exacerbation, likely triggered by medication non-adherence. Schizophrenia pathophysiology involves an imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, in the brain's mesolimbic pathway. Antipsychotics like risperidone block dopamine receptors, reducing psychotic symptoms. Abrupt cessation leads to dopamine surges, causing symptom recurrence. The priority is de-escalation using the least restrictive approach. Maintaining a safe distance (e.g., 2 arm lengths) and speaking calmly reduces the client's perceived threat. Following de-escalation and potential PRN medication administration, monitoring for escalating agitation is crucial to determine intervention effectiveness. Monitoring for medication side effects (e.g., EPS, sedation, orthostatic hypotension) ensures client safety.",
    "incorrect": "Calling security and preparing for seclusion is premature; it's a highly restrictive intervention reserved for situations where de-escalation fails. Arguing with delusions can increase agitation. Immediate IM medication bypasses verbal de-escalation. Group therapy is inappropriate for an acutely agitated client. Anticholinergic crisis presents with distinct symptoms (e.g., dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention). NMS involves fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term side effect, not an acute presentation. Substance intoxication lacks the clear history of medication non-adherence. Monitoring for command hallucinations or willingness to discuss delusions is less relevant in the acute phase than assessing safety and medication effects. Development of therapeutic rapport is a long-term goal, not an immediate monitoring parameter.",
