This involves maintaining a safe distance and using a calm tone, which are the least restrictive interventions. Following this and any potential administration of PRN medication, the nurse must monitor for both continued signs of escalating agitation (to determine if further intervention is needed) and adverse effects of the medication (such as extrapyramidal symptoms or oversedation).",

The other conditions are less likely; there are no signs of NMS (e.g., fever, rigidity), anticholinergic crisis (e.g., dry mucous membranes, urinary retention), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements), or evidence of substance use. Monitoring parameters should focus on immediate safety and medication effects, not long-term therapeutic goals like rapport or delusion discussion, or a specific symptom (command hallucinations) that has not been identified.",
