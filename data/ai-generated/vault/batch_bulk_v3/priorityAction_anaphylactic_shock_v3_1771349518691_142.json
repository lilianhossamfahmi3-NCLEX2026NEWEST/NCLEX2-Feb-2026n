        "correct": true,
        "explanation": "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction causing mast cell and basophil degranulation, releasing histamine and other mediators. Epinephrine's alpha-1 adrenergic effects cause vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and reducing mucosal edema. Its beta-1 adrenergic effects increase heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output. Beta-2 adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, reversing bronchospasm. The IM route allows for rapid absorption. Clinical Pearl: Always prioritize epinephrine in anaphylaxis. Delay can be fatal.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Epinephrine is the cornerstone of anaphylaxis treatment. Administer promptly to reverse life-threatening symptoms."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "High-Fowler's position is contraindicated due to the client's hypotension. Anaphylactic shock causes massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position would exacerbate hypotension by pooling blood in the lower extremities, further reducing venous return to the heart. This can lead to decreased cerebral perfusion and potential cardiovascular collapse. Clinical Pearl: In hypotensive patients, avoid positions that exacerbate venous pooling.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Avoid high-Fowler's position in hypotensive patients as it can worsen blood pressure."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_3",
        "correct": true,
        "explanation": "The client is exhibiting signs of severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia (SpO2 89%). A non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-100%) to improve oxygen saturation. Anaphylaxis causes bronchospasm and laryngeal edema, impairing gas exchange. Increasing the FiO2 helps to counteract the effects of impaired ventilation and perfusion. Clinical Pearl: Rapid oxygenation is crucial in anaphylaxis to prevent end-organ damage from hypoxia.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Ensure adequate oxygenation with a non-rebreather mask to address hypoxemia in anaphylaxis."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "Diphenhydramine is a second-line treatment for anaphylaxis. It is an antihistamine that blocks H1 receptors, reducing the effects of histamine, such as urticaria and pruritus. However, it does not directly address the life-threatening symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension, or laryngeal edema. Epinephrine is the priority. Diphenhydramine can be administered after initial stabilization. Clinical Pearl: Antihistamines are helpful for cutaneous symptoms but do not replace epinephrine in anaphylaxis.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Diphenhydramine is a secondary treatment; prioritize epinephrine for immediate life-threatening symptoms."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "correct": true,
        "explanation": "Anaphylactic shock causes massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to a significant drop in blood pressure. Rapid administration of intravenous fluids, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, is essential to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. This helps to counteract the effects of vasodilation and maintain adequate blood pressure. The fluid bolus increases preload, improving stroke volume and cardiac output. Clinical Pearl: Rapid fluid resuscitation is critical to address hypotension in anaphylactic shock.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Aggressive fluid resuscitation is vital to combat hypotension caused by vasodilation in anaphylaxis."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "opt_6",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist that causes bronchodilation. While it can help to relieve bronchospasm, it does not address the other life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as hypotension and laryngeal edema. Epinephrine is a more comprehensive treatment as it addresses both bronchospasm and vasodilation. Albuterol can be used as an adjunct therapy after epinephrine administration. Clinical Pearl: Albuterol is a useful adjunct but not a replacement for epinephrine in anaphylaxis.",
        "clinicalPearl": "Albuterol can be used as an adjunct, but epinephrine is the primary bronchodilator in anaphylaxis due to its additional effects on blood pressure and edema."
