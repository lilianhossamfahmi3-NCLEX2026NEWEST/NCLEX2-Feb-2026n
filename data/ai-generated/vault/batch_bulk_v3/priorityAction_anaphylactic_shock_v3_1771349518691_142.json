                "optionId": "opt_1",
                "explanation": "Correct. Epinephrine is the first-line, life-saving intervention for anaphylaxis. Its alpha-adrenergic effects reverse vasodilation and reduce edema, addressing the severe hypotension (84/52 mmHg). Its beta-adrenergic effects cause bronchodilation, combating the life-threatening wheezing and 'closing throat' sensation. It must be administered immediately."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "explanation": "Incorrect. While a high-Fowler's position can ease the work of breathing, it is contraindicated in a patient with severe hypotension (BP 84/52 mmHg). This position would cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, further decreasing venous return and cardiac output, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "explanation": "Correct. The client is hypoxic (SpO2 89%) and in significant respiratory distress (RR 28, wheezing). A non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min delivers the highest concentration of supplemental oxygen (up to 90-100%) to correct hypoxemia and support oxygenation during this respiratory emergency."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "explanation": "Incorrect. Diphenhydramine, an H1-antihistamine, is a second-line treatment. It helps manage cutaneous symptoms like urticaria and flushing but does not rapidly reverse the life-threatening bronchoconstriction or hypotension. It should be administered only after stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation with epinephrine, oxygen, and IV fluids."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "explanation": "Correct. Anaphylactic shock is a form of distributive shock characterized by massive vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to a sharp drop in blood pressure (84/52 mmHg). A rapid bolus of isotonic crystalloid (0.9% sodium chloride) is critical to expand intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "explanation": "Incorrect. Albuterol is a selective beta-2 agonist that addresses bronchospasm and wheezing. However, epinephrine is superior as it is non-selective, addressing not only bronchospasm but also the systemic vasodilation, hypotension, and laryngeal edema. Albuterol is a useful adjunct therapy but is not a primary, immediate action over epinephrine."
