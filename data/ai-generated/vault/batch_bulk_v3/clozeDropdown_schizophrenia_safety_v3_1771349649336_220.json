Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, thereby reducing the positive symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, enhances the effect of GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. By increasing GABAergic neurotransmission, lorazepam helps to reduce anxiety, agitation, and promote sedation. This combination is particularly effective in managing acute agitation because it addresses both the psychotic symptoms and the associated anxiety and agitation, leading to a more rapid and comprehensive calming effect.",
