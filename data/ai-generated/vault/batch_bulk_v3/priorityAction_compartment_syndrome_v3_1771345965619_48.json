States the pain is worse than it was an hour ago and was not relieved by IV morphine administered 30 minutes ago. Client describes the arm as feeling \"extremely tight and swollen\" under the cast. Also reports new onset of numbness and a \"pins and needles\" sensation in the right thumb and index finger.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs: BP 148/92 mmHg, HR 112/min, RR 22/min, Temp 37.1°C (98.8°F), SpO2 99% on room air.\nRight upper extremity: Fingers are pale and cool to the touch. Capillary refill is 4 seconds. Radial pulse is weak and difficult to palpate with a doppler. Obvious edema of the fingers is noted. Passive extension of the client's fingers elicits an extreme pain response."
