    "itemStem": "A 48-year-old male client presents to the outpatient mental health clinic for a follow-up appointment. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder six weeks ago and started on sertraline 50 mg daily. The client states, \"I'm not crying all the time anymore, but something feels off. I have so much energy now, I only need 3 hours of sleep!\" He reports maxing out two credit cards on a new home theater system last week, stating, \"It was an amazing deal, I had to do it!\" During the interview, the nurse notes the client speaks rapidly, jumping from one topic to another. His wife called the clinic earlier, expressing concern about his \"erratic and impulsive\" behavior.",

    "answerBreakdown": {
        "conditionRationale": {
            "C1": "Incorrect. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus), and mental status changes (agitation, confusion). While the client has mental status changes, he lacks the key autonomic and neuromuscular features.",
            "C2": "Incorrect. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a reaction to antipsychotic medications, not SSRIs. Its hallmark signs are severe muscle rigidity ('lead-pipe' rigidity), hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and altered mental status.",
            "C3": "Correct. The client is exhibiting classic signs of hypomania: elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, and impulsive, high-risk behavior (excessive spending). This clinical picture, occurring after the initiation of an antidepressant, is highly suggestive of an antidepressant-induced switch to a hypomanic state, unmasking a likely underlying bipolar spectrum disorder.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. While there is some improvement in depressive symptoms (less crying), the emergence of elevated energy, impulsivity, and decreased sleep is not indicative of successful treatment. It represents a significant, adverse change in clinical status.",
            "C5": "Incorrect. A depressive episode with anxious distress would involve symptoms like tension, restlessness, worry, and fear, but not the elevated mood, grandiosity (implied by impulsive spending), and decreased need for sleep seen in this client."
        },
        "actionsRationale": {
            "A1": "Incorrect. While medication adherence is generally important, the current issue is likely caused by the medication itself. Encouraging continued use without provider consultation could worsen the hypomanic episode.",
            "A2": "Correct. The client's impulsivity and poor judgment significantly increase the risk for harm to self or others. A thorough safety assessment, including suicidal and homicidal ideation, is an immediate priority.",
            "A3": "Incorrect. Increasing the dose of the precipitating medication (sertraline) would likely exacerbate the hypomanic symptoms and is contraindicated.",
            "A4": "Correct. This significant change in the client's clinical presentation requires immediate re-evaluation by the prescribing provider. The treatment plan will likely need to be changed, potentially by discontinuing the antidepressant and initiating a mood stabilizer.",
            "A5": "Incorrect. The client's condition is acute and requires immediate intervention to ensure safety and prevent escalation to full mania. A one-month delay is unsafe and inappropriate."
        },
        "parametersRationale": {
            "P1": "Correct. A decreased need for sleep is a core symptom of hypomania. Monitoring sleep patterns is essential to track the client's response to treatment and a return to a normal sleep duration would be a key indicator of stabilization.",
            "P2": "Incorrect. Serum creatinine levels assess kidney function. While important for some psychiatric medications like lithium, it is not a direct or priority parameter to monitor for this client's acute presentation of hypomania.",
            "P3": "Correct. The client has already demonstrated significant impulsive behavior (excessive spending). Continued monitoring for such behaviors (e.g., reckless driving, financial indiscretion, risky sexual encounters) is critical for patient safety.",
            "P4": "Correct. The primary problem is mood dysregulation. The nurse must closely monitor the client's mood (subjective feeling) and affect (objective expression) for signs of continued elevation, irritability, or a switch back to depression.",
            "P5": "Incorrect. While appetite can be affected in mood disorders, daily caloric intake is not a primary parameter to monitor in this acute hypomanic state unless there is a significant, co-occurring issue like severe weight loss."
