            "c1": "Incorrect. An endotracheal tube cuff leak would result in a loss of pressure within the circuit, leading to a low-pressure or low exhaled tidal volume alarm, not a high-pressure alarm.",
            "c2": "Incorrect. Worsening acidosis or anxiety would cause the client to increase their spontaneous breathing rate, potentially leading to a high respiratory rate alarm or patient-ventilator asynchrony, but it does not directly cause an obstruction that would trigger a high-pressure alarm.",
            "c3": "Correct. A mucus plug in the endotracheal tube or client's airway acts as an obstruction. The ventilator must generate higher pressure to deliver the set tidal volume against this resistance, which will trigger the high-pressure limit alarm.",
            "c4": "Incorrect. A ventilator circuit disconnection creates a major leak in the system, resulting in a failure to build up any pressure. This would cause a low-pressure alarm, which is the opposite of a high-pressure alarm."
        },
        "r2": {
            "c1": "Incorrect. While an endotracheal tube cuff leak does cause a loss of pressure, it is typically a smaller, more contained leak. It is more likely to trigger a low exhaled tidal volume alarm first. A complete circuit disconnection is the most common cause of a profound pressure drop that triggers the low-pressure limit alarm.",
            "c2": "Incorrect. Worsening acidosis or anxiety affects the client's respiratory drive and rate but does not create a leak or pressure drop in the ventilator circuit.",
            "c3": "Incorrect. A mucus plug is an obstruction that causes increased airway resistance, leading to a high-pressure alarm, not a low-pressure alarm.",
            "c4": "Correct. A low-pressure limit alarm indicates that the ventilator is not detecting adequate pressure to deliver a breath. The most common and critical cause is a disconnection in the ventilator circuit, creating a massive leak."
        },
        "r3": {
            "c1": "Correct. A low exhaled tidal volume alarm means the volume of gas returning from the client's lungs is significantly less than the volume delivered. An endotracheal tube cuff leak allows a portion of the delivered tidal volume to escape around the cuff and out the mouth, so it is not returned to the ventilator to be measured. This is a classic sign of a cuff leak.",
            "c2": "Incorrect. Worsening acidosis or anxiety relates to the client's respiratory rate and effort, not the integrity of the closed ventilator circuit or the volume returned to it.",
            "c3": "Incorrect. A mucus plug is an obstruction. If the ventilator is able to overcome the obstruction, the full exhaled tidal volume should return. If it cannot, a high-pressure alarm will sound. It does not cause a leak.",
            "c4": "Incorrect. A complete ventilator circuit disconnection would also cause a low exhaled tidal volume (often zero), but it would more immediately and profoundly trigger the low-pressure alarm due to the complete loss of circuit pressure."
        },
        "r4": {
            "c1": "Incorrect. An endotracheal tube cuff leak is a mechanical issue related to the airway device and does not directly stimulate the client to breathe faster.",
            "c2": "Correct. A high respiratory rate alarm is triggered when the client's spontaneous breaths, added to any mandatory breaths, exceed the alarm's upper limit. This increased respiratory drive is commonly caused by hypoxemia, pain, anxiety, or worsening metabolic/respiratory acidosis, all of which are significant risks for a client with ARDS and sepsis.",
            "c3": "Incorrect. A mucus plug would cause a high-pressure alarm due to obstruction. While the resulting hypoxemia could lead to an increased respiratory rate, the primary alarm related to the plug itself is the high-pressure alarm.",
            "c4": "Incorrect. A ventilator circuit disconnection would lead to apnea and low-pressure alarms, as the client would not be receiving any ventilator support. It would not cause a high respiratory rate."
