    "question": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old female who is 3 days post-total knee arthroplasty. The client suddenly reports sharp, pleuritic chest pain and severe dyspnea. The nurse assesses the following vital signs: heart rate 128/min, blood pressure 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 32/min, and SpO2 89% on room air. Which of the following actions should the nurse take first?",

        "correct": "The client's clinical presentation of sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia is highly indicative of a pulmonary embolism (PE), a life-threatening condition. The immediate priority is to address the hypoxemia, which is the most significant threat to life. Applying a non-rebreather mask provides the highest concentration of supplemental oxygen, directly addressing the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch caused by the embolism and aiming to improve oxygen saturation and tissue perfusion. This action follows the airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) framework for prioritization.",
        "incorrect": "While other actions are appropriate, they are not the first priority. Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position helps with lung expansion but does not correct the underlying hypoxemia as directly as supplemental oxygen. Notifying the RRT is crucial, but an immediate, life-sustaining intervention should be performed first or simultaneously. Administering morphine before stabilizing oxygenation is contraindicated, as its respiratory depressant effects could worsen the client's already compromised respiratory status.",
