  "question": "A nurse is caring for a 68-year-old female who is 3 days post-total knee arthroplasty. At 1400, the client suddenly reports sharp, pleuritic chest pain and severe dyspnea. The nurse assesses the following vital signs: heart rate 128/min, blood pressure 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 32/min, and SpO2 89% on room air. Which of the following actions should the nurse take first?",

  "correctAnswer": "opt_03",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client's presentation (sudden pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia) strongly suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE). A PE occurs when a blood clot, often from the legs (deep vein thrombosis), travels to the lungs and blocks pulmonary arteries. This obstruction impairs gas exchange, leading to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and hypoxemia. The immediate priority is to improve oxygenation to prevent further tissue hypoxia and potential cardiac arrest. Administering oxygen via a non-rebreather mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (80-95%), increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and driving more oxygen into the blood. This directly addresses the V/Q mismatch and improves SpO2.",
    "incorrect": "While other actions are important, they are not the *first* priority. \n\n*   **Notifying the RRT:** Essential, but oxygenation is the immediate need. Delaying oxygen administration while waiting for the RRT could lead to rapid deterioration.\n*   **Administering Morphine:** Contraindicated at this stage. Morphine is a respiratory depressant and could worsen hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Pain management should be addressed *after* stabilizing the patient's respiratory status.\n*   **High-Fowler's Position:** Helpful for lung expansion, but does not directly address the hypoxemia. It's a supportive measure, not a primary intervention.",
    "clinicalPearls": "*   Sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain in a post-operative patient should always raise suspicion for PE.\n*   Always prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).\n*   Never administer respiratory depressants (e.g., opioids) to a patient with acute respiratory distress without addressing oxygenation first.\n*   Early recognition and intervention are crucial in managing PE to prevent complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death."

    "situation": "68-year-old female, 3 days post-total knee arthroplasty, reporting sudden onset of sharp, pleuritic chest pain and severe dyspnea at 1400.",
    "background": "Post-operative status increases risk for thromboembolic events. Patient has a history of osteoarthritis and underwent an uneventful total knee arthroplasty. Current medications include pain medications and prophylactic anticoagulation.",
    "assessment": "HR 128/min, BP 105/65 mmHg, RR 32/min, SpO2 89% on room air. Patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe.",
