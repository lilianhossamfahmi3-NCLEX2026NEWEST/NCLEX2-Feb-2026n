    "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder. The client was brought in by family due to increasing confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia over the past 48 hours. The client reports vomiting, diarrhea, and coarse hand tremors. A week ago, the client started a new medication for hypertension. Vital signs are BP 105/60 mmHg, HR 115 bpm, RR 20/min, Temp 98.9°F (37.2°C). Laboratory results show: Serum lithium 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), Sodium 132 mEq/L, BUN 30 mg/dL, and Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL. Based on these findings, which action should the nurse prioritize?",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The client is experiencing moderate to severe lithium toxicity, evidenced by the elevated serum level (2.1 mEq/L) and neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia, tremors). The client is also clinically dehydrated and hyponatremic, as indicated by vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and low sodium. Lithium is cleared by the kidneys, and its excretion is dependent on adequate renal perfusion and normal sodium levels. Dehydration and hyponatremia significantly decrease lithium clearance, creating a vicious cycle of worsening toxicity. The priority action is to initiate IV fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride to restore intravascular volume, improve renal perfusion, correct the hyponatremia, and promote the renal excretion of lithium.",
        "incorrect": "While the other options may be considered in the overall plan of care, they are not the immediate priority. Administering an antiemetic addresses a symptom but does not correct the underlying life-threatening toxicity or dehydration. Preparing for hemodialysis may be necessary for severe toxicity, but it is not the first action; fluid resuscitation is the initial step to stabilize the client and promote natural clearance. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate and unsafe given the client's confusion, ataxia, and vomiting, which pose a high risk for aspiration.",

While hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity (levels >2.5 mEq/L with severe neurologic symptoms or renal failure), the first step is always to stabilize the client hemodynamically. IV fluid resuscitation must be initiated first to address dehydration and promote renal clearance.",
