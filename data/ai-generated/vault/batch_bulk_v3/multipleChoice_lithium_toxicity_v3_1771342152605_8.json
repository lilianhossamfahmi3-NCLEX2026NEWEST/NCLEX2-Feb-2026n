  "question": "A nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder. The client was brought in by family due to increasing confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia over the past 48 hours. The client reports vomiting, diarrhea, and coarse hand tremors. A week ago, the client started a new medication for hypertension. Vital signs are BP 105/60 mmHg, HR 115 bpm, RR 20/min, Temp 98.9°F (37.2°C). Laboratory results show: Serum lithium 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), Sodium 132 mEq/L, BUN 30 mg/dL, and Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL. Based on these findings, which action should the nurse prioritize?",

  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The client is experiencing moderate to severe lithium toxicity, evidenced by the elevated serum level (2.1 mEq/L) and neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia, tremors). The client is also clinically dehydrated and hyponatremic, as indicated by vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN/Creatinine, and low sodium (132 mEq/L). Lithium is primarily cleared by the kidneys; its excretion is dependent on adequate renal perfusion and normal sodium levels. Dehydration and hyponatremia significantly decrease lithium clearance, creating a vicious cycle of worsening toxicity. The priority action is to initiate IV fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride to restore intravascular volume, improve renal perfusion, correct the hyponatremia, and promote the renal excretion of lithium. This addresses the underlying pathophysiology of lithium toxicity exacerbated by dehydration.",
    "incorrect": "While the other options may be considered in the overall plan of care, they are not the immediate priority. Administering an antiemetic addresses a symptom but does not correct the underlying life-threatening toxicity or dehydration. Preparing for hemodialysis may be necessary for severe toxicity, but it is not the first action; fluid resuscitation is the initial step to stabilize the client and promote natural clearance. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate and unsafe given the client's confusion, ataxia, and vomiting, which pose a high risk for aspiration. These actions fail to address the immediate threat of lithium toxicity and dehydration.",
    "answerBreakdown": [
      {
        "label": "A",
        "content": "Preparing for hemodialysis is incorrect as the initial priority. While hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for severe lithium toxicity (levels >2.5 mEq/L with severe neurologic symptoms or renal failure), the first step is always to stabilize the client hemodynamically. IV fluid resuscitation must be initiated first to address dehydration and promote renal clearance. Hemodialysis is a later consideration if the client does not respond to initial interventions.",

      },
      {
        "label": "B",
        "content": "Administering an antiemetic is incorrect as the priority. Although vomiting contributes to dehydration, it is a symptom of the underlying toxicity. The most critical intervention is to address the cause of the symptoms by restoring fluid volume and promoting lithium excretion. This action is secondary to hemodynamic stabilization. Treating the symptom without addressing the cause will not resolve the lithium toxicity.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "label": "C",
        "content": "This is the correct priority action. The client's tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN/Cr, and hyponatremia are classic signs of dehydration, which impairs renal clearance of lithium. Initiating 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously will restore volume, correct the sodium deficit, improve renal blood flow, and enhance lithium excretion, directly addressing the life-threatening condition. This action targets the pathophysiology of lithium toxicity and dehydration.",

      {
        "label": "D",
        "content": "Encouraging oral fluids is incorrect and potentially dangerous. The client's altered mental status (confusion) and ataxia increase the risk of aspiration. Furthermore, ongoing vomiting would make oral rehydration ineffective. Intravenous access is necessary for rapid and safe rehydration in this acute situation. This action could lead to aspiration pneumonia and further compromise the client's condition.",

    "situation": "At 1400, a 45-year-old client with a history of bipolar I disorder presented to the emergency department with increasing confusion, slurred speech, ataxia, vomiting, diarrhea, and tremors over the past 48 hours.",
    "background": "The client has a history of bipolar I disorder treated with lithium. The client started a new medication for hypertension one week ago. Current medications and dosages are not specified.",
    "assessment": "The client's vital signs are BP 105/60 mmHg, HR 115 bpm, RR 20/min, Temp 98.9°F (37.2°C). Laboratory results show: Serum lithium 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), Sodium 132 mEq/L, BUN 30 mg/dL, and Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL. These findings indicate moderate to severe lithium toxicity complicated by dehydration and hyponatremia. Neurological status is compromised.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately initiate intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride. Continuously monitor vital signs, neurological status, serum lithium levels, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine. Consult nephrology regarding the potential need for emergent hemodialysis if the client's condition does not improve with fluid resuscitation or if neurologic symptoms worsen. Review the client's hypertension medication for potential interactions with lithium or contributions to dehydration. Consider telemetry monitoring due to electrolyte imbalances and potential cardiac effects of lithium toxicity."
