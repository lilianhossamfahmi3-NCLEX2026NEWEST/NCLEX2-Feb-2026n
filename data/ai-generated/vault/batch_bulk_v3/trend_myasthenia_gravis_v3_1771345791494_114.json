    "correct": "[+] Decreasing vital capacity: The most concerning finding is the precipitous decline in vital capacity from 1800 mL at 14:00 to 950 mL at 16:00. This indicates rapidly worsening respiratory muscle weakness, a hallmark of myasthenic crisis and impending respiratory failure. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, impairing nerve impulse transmission to muscles. During a crisis, this weakness can severely affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to reduced lung expansion and decreased vital capacity. A vital capacity below 1000 mL (or <15 mL/kg) signifies a critical threshold for respiratory support. Immediate intervention, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or endotracheal intubation, is crucial to prevent respiratory arrest.\n[+] Development of drooling: The development of drooling by 16:00 signifies severe bulbar muscle weakness, affecting the muscles responsible for swallowing and managing oral secretions. This is a direct consequence of the acetylcholine receptor blockade in the bulbar muscles (facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and hypoglossal nerves). The inability to effectively clear secretions places the client at high risk for aspiration pneumonia and airway obstruction. This requires immediate intervention, including suctioning, positioning to protect the airway, and potentially intubation if the client cannot maintain airway patency.",
    "incorrect": "[-] Increasing heart rate: While the heart rate increased from 98/min to 118/min, this is a non-specific compensatory response to hypoxia and stress. It is less indicative of the primary problem (respiratory and bulbar muscle weakness) than the declining vital capacity or inability to manage secretions. Tachycardia in this setting is likely due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity in response to hypoxemia and anxiety.\n[-] Stable blood pressure: A stable blood pressure is a reassuring sign of adequate circulatory function at this time. It does not indicate immediate respiratory compromise or airway obstruction.\n[-] Worsening ptosis: While worsening ptosis (drooping eyelids) is a classic sign of Myasthenia Gravis, it primarily affects the oculomotor muscles and does not directly impact the client's airway, breathing, or circulation. It is a lower priority compared to signs of respiratory or bulbar muscle failure.\n[-] Client report of generalized fatigue: Generalized fatigue and weakness are hallmark symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis and are expected to worsen during an exacerbation. This subjective finding is less critical than objective data indicating respiratory collapse.",
