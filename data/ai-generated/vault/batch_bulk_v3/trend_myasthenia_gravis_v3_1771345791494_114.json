        "correct": "The most concerning findings indicate impending respiratory failure, a hallmark of myasthenic crisis. The rapid decline in vital capacity (from 1800 mL to 950 mL) is a critical objective measure of weakening respiratory muscles. A vital capacity below 1000 mL (or <15 mL/kg) signals imminent respiratory arrest. Concurrently, the development of drooling indicates severe bulbar muscle weakness, compromising the client's ability to protect their airway from secretions, which significantly increases the risk of aspiration and airway obstruction. These two findings together represent a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or endotracheal intubation, to support breathing and protect the airway.",
        "incorrect": "While worsening ptosis, fatigue, and tachycardia are all signs of a Myasthenia Gravis exacerbation, they do not pose the same immediate life-threatening risk as respiratory muscle failure and loss of airway protection. Ptosis affects vision but not vital functions. Fatigue is a subjective and expected symptom. Tachycardia is a non-specific compensatory sign of distress but is less indicative of the primary problem than direct measures of respiratory and bulbar function. A stable blood pressure is a reassuring sign and not a cause for concern.",
