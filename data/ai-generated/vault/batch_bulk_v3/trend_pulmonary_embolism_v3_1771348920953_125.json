Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place and functioning. Client is reluctant to ambulate, stating, \"My knee is just too sore to walk on today.\" Encouraged use of incentive spirometer.\n\n**1200:** Client used the call light. Found client to be extremely anxious, tachypneic, and reporting a sudden, sharp pain in his chest that is worse on inspiration. States, \"I can't catch my breath, something is very wrong.\""

        "opt_1": "Incorrect. While atelectasis is a common postoperative complication that can cause hypoxemia, the presentation is typically more gradual. The client's sudden onset of severe, pleuritic chest pain, extreme anxiety, and significant tachycardia and tachypnea are more indicative of a pulmonary embolism than simple lung collapse.",
        "opt_2": "Correct. The client has significant risk factors for a venous thromboembolism (VTE) leading to a pulmonary embolism (PE): major orthopedic surgery, immobility post-op, and obesity. The trend from 0800 to 1200 shows a classic, acute presentation of PE: sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (SpO2 89%). The ABG results showing respiratory alkalosis (high pH, low PaCO2) from hyperventilation and hypoxemia (low PaO2) further support this diagnosis.",
        "opt_3": "Incorrect. Attributing these findings solely to an anxiety attack is a dangerous misinterpretation. While the client is extremely anxious, this is a physiological response to acute hypoxia and the feeling of impending doom associated with a pulmonary embolism. The objective data (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia) point to a life-threatening medical emergency, not a primary psychiatric condition.",
        "opt_4": "Incorrect. Although a myocardial infarction (MI) presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, the pain is typically described as crushing or pressure-like, not sharp and pleuritic (worse on inspiration). The primary and most dramatic change is in the respiratory system (RR from 18 to 32, SpO2 from 97% to 89%), which, combined with the specific risk factors for VTE, makes PE the most likely diagnosis.",
        "opt_5": "Incorrect. Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is a risk after long bone fractures or orthopedic surgery, but it typically presents 24-72 hours post-injury. While the timing is plausible, the classic triad of FES includes respiratory distress, neurologic changes (e.g., confusion, restlessness), and a petechial rash. This client's presentation lacks the neurological and dermatological signs, making a pulmonary embolism from a deep vein thrombosis the more probable cause."
