Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place and functioning. Client is reluctant to ambulate, stating, \"My knee is just too sore to walk on today.\" Encouraged use of incentive spirometer.\n\n**1200:** Client used the call light.

      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. While atelectasis is a common postoperative complication that can cause hypoxemia, the presentation is typically more gradual. The client's sudden onset of severe, pleuritic chest pain, extreme anxiety, and significant tachycardia and tachypnea are more indicative of a pulmonary embolism than simple lung collapse. Atelectasis involves alveolar collapse, reducing gas exchange. This typically develops slowly due to factors like pain, anesthesia, and immobility post-surgery. The ABG in atelectasis would likely show hypoxemia and hypercapnia (increased PaCO2) if severe, not the respiratory alkalosis seen here.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Encourage early ambulation and incentive spirometry postoperatively to prevent atelectasis. Monitor breath sounds and oxygen saturation regularly."
    },
    "opt_2": {
      "correct": true,
      "rationale": "Correct. The client has significant risk factors for a venous thromboembolism (VTE) leading to a pulmonary embolism (PE): major orthopedic surgery, immobility post-op, and obesity. The trend from 0800 to 1200 shows a classic, acute presentation of PE: sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (SpO2 89%). The ABG results showing respiratory alkalosis (high pH, low PaCO2) from hyperventilation and hypoxemia (low PaO2) further support this diagnosis. A PE occurs when a thrombus, often from a DVT, dislodges and travels to the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow to the lungs. This leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, causing hypoxemia. The body compensates by increasing respiratory rate (tachypnea), leading to a decrease in PaCO2 and respiratory alkalosis. The sudden blockage increases pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to increased heart rate (tachycardia) as the heart tries to maintain cardiac output.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Early ambulation, prophylactic anticoagulation, and the use of SCDs are crucial in preventing VTE in high-risk postoperative patients. Be vigilant for signs of PE, especially sudden dyspnea and chest pain."
    },
    "opt_3": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Attributing these findings solely to an anxiety attack is a dangerous misinterpretation. While the client is extremely anxious, this is a physiological response to acute hypoxia and the feeling of impending doom associated with a pulmonary embolism. The objective data (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia) point to a life-threatening medical emergency, not a primary psychiatric condition. While anxiety can cause hyperventilation, it typically does not cause the degree of hypoxemia seen in this case. Furthermore, the sudden onset and pleuritic chest pain are not typical of an anxiety attack. It is critical to rule out life-threatening conditions before attributing symptoms to a psychiatric cause.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Always consider organic causes for sudden-onset anxiety, especially when accompanied by respiratory distress or other objective findings. Obtain a thorough history and physical assessment."
    },
    "opt_4": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Although a myocardial infarction (MI) presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, the pain is typically described as crushing or pressure-like, not sharp and pleuritic (worse on inspiration). The primary and most dramatic change is in the respiratory system (RR from 18 to 32, SpO2 from 97% to 89%), which, combined with the specific risk factors for VTE, makes PE the most likely diagnosis. An MI occurs due to a blockage in a coronary artery, leading to myocardial ischemia and potential infarction. While dyspnea can occur due to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary congestion, the chest pain is typically substernal, radiating, and not affected by breathing. ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes are also characteristic of MI.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Differentiate between cardiac and pulmonary causes of chest pain. Pleuritic chest pain is often associated with pulmonary conditions, while pressure-like chest pain is more indicative of cardiac ischemia."
    },
    "opt_5": {
      "correct": false,
      "rationale": "Incorrect. Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is a risk after long bone fractures or orthopedic surgery, but it typically presents 24-72 hours post-injury. While the timing is plausible, the classic triad of FES includes respiratory distress, neurologic changes (e.g., confusion, restlessness), and a petechial rash. This client's presentation lacks the neurological and dermatological signs, making a pulmonary embolism from a deep vein thrombosis the more probable cause. FES occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the circulation, leading to capillary blockage and inflammation in various organs, including the lungs and brain. While respiratory distress is a common feature, the presence of neurological symptoms and petechiae is crucial for diagnosis.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Monitor for signs of FES in patients with long bone fractures or orthopedic surgery, especially within the first 72 hours. Look for the classic triad of respiratory distress, neurological changes, and petechiae."
