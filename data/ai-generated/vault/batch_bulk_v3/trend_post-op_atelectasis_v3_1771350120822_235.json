Jackson-Pratt drain with minimal serosanguinous output. Pain rated 7/10 at incision site. Morphine PCA in use. Respirations 20/min and shallow. Reluctant to cough or deep breathe. Encouraged use of incentive spirometer (IS), achieved 500 mL x 5. Lung sounds diminished in bilateral bases.\n\n**Post-Op Day 2 - 0800**\nClient more alert today. Pain rated 4/10, reports PCA is effective. Abdominal distention noted. Reluctant to ambulate, states he is 'too tired'. Incentive spirometer use remains poor, achieving 450 mL x 4 despite encouragement. Fine crackles auscultated in bilateral lower lobes. Productive cough with small amount of thick, white sputum.\n\n**Post-Op Day 3 - 0800**\nClient reports feeling short of breath. Appears anxious. Using accessory muscles to breathe. Respirations 26/min. Crackles auscultated in bilateral lower lobes, more pronounced than yesterday. Client refused incentive spirometer use this morning, stating 'it hurts too much to breathe deep'."

        "correct": "The client's overall condition is worsening. The trend data shows a progressive decline in respiratory function, characterized by decreasing oxygen saturation despite increased oxygen support, rising temperature, increasing respiratory and heart rates, and worsening adventitious breath sounds. These findings strongly suggest that the initial post-operative atelectasis is progressing to pneumonia. The root cause is ineffective respiratory effort and poor lung expansion, as evidenced by the consistently poor use of the incentive spirometer. Although pain control has improved, it has not translated to improved respiratory mechanics, and the overall clinical picture is one of decompensation.",
        "incorrect": "The client's condition is not improving or unchanged. Selecting 'Improving' for respiratory parameters would be incorrect as all objective data (SpO2, temp, RR, breath sounds) show a negative trend. While pain is improving, this single parameter does not reflect the client's overall status. An 'Unchanged' status is also incorrect, as the clear progression of abnormal findings demonstrates a dynamic and deteriorating process, not a static one.",
