Jackson-Pratt drain with minimal serosanguinous output. Pain rated 7/10 at incision site. Morphine PCA in use. Respirations 20/min and shallow. Reluctant to cough or deep breathe. Encouraged use of incentive spirometer (IS), achieved 500 mL x 5. Lung sounds diminished in bilateral bases.\n\n**Post-Op Day 2 - 0800**\nClient more alert today. Pain rated 4/10, reports PCA is effective. Abdominal distention noted. Reluctant to ambulate, states he is 'too tired'. Incentive spirometer use remains poor, achieving 450 mL x 4 despite encouragement. Fine crackles auscultated in bilateral lower lobes. Productive cough with small amount of thick, white sputum.\n\n**Post-Op Day 3 - 0800**\nClient reports feeling short of breath. Appears anxious. Using accessory muscles to breathe. Respirations 26/min. Crackles auscultated in bilateral lower lobes, more pronounced than yesterday. Client refused incentive spirometer use this morning, stating 'it hurts too much to breathe deep'."

    "correct": "The client's overall condition is worsening, indicating a progression from post-operative atelectasis towards potential pneumonia. The trend data reveals a decline in respiratory function: decreasing oxygen saturation despite increased oxygen support, rising temperature, increasing respiratory and heart rates, and worsening adventitious breath sounds. The primary issue is ineffective respiratory effort and poor lung expansion, evidenced by consistently poor incentive spirometer use. While pain control has improved, it hasn't translated into improved respiratory mechanics. This clinical picture suggests decompensation. Atelectasis, alveolar collapse, reduces gas exchange surface. Trapped secretions become a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to pneumonia. Post-op pain, immobility, and anesthesia contribute to shallow breathing and ineffective cough, exacerbating atelectasis.",
    "incorrect": "Selecting 'Improving' or 'Unchanged' for respiratory parameters is incorrect. Objective data (SpO2, temperature, respiratory rate, breath sounds) show a negative trend. While pain is improving, this single parameter doesn't reflect the client's overall status. The progression of abnormal findings demonstrates a deteriorating process, not a static or improving one. Ignoring the worsening respiratory signs could lead to delayed intervention and further complications.",
