    "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic signs and symptoms of a pheochromocytoma crisis, a life-threatening condition caused by excessive release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from a tumor in the adrenal medulla. The hallmark features include paroxysmal hypertension (BP 240/130 mmHg), severe headache, tachycardia (HR 145 bpm), profuse diaphoresis, and a sense of impending doom. The surge of catecholamines leads to intense vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and contractility, and stimulation of sweat glands. Prompt recognition is crucial to initiate interventions such as administering alpha-adrenergic blockers (e.g., phentolamine) to counteract the effects of catecholamines and prevent end-organ damage (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction).",
    "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either normal, expected given the client's pre-operative status, or non-specific signs of distress. While tachypnea (RR 24 breaths/minute) can occur due to anxiety and pain, it is not a primary indicator of a pheochromocytoma crisis. Similarly, a normal temperature (37.1°C/98.8°F) and adequate oxygen saturation (SpO2 95%) do not suggest the underlying endocrine emergency. The client's NPO status is related to the scheduled surgery and is irrelevant to the acute presentation. Focusing on these findings could delay the diagnosis and treatment of the life-threatening pheochromocytoma crisis.",

Prepare to administer alpha-adrenergic blockers (e.g., phentolamine) as prescribed to control the severe hypertension. Continuously monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate. Prepare for potential complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Avoid palpating the abdomen as this can trigger further catecholamine release."
