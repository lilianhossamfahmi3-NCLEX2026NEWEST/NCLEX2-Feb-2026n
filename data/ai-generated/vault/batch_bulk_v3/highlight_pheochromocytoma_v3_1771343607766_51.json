        "correct": "The client is exhibiting the classic pentad of symptoms for a pheochromocytoma crisis: paroxysmal hypertension, pounding headache, palpitations (tachycardia), and profuse diaphoresis, along with a sense of impending doom. This is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by a surge of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from a tumor on the adrenal medulla. These specific cues must be recognized immediately to initiate life-saving interventions, such as administering an alpha-adrenergic blocker to control the severe hypertension.",
        "incorrect": "The unselected findings are either normal, expected for the situation (e.g., NPO status), or non-specific signs of distress (e.g., tachypnea) that are secondary to the primary crisis. While part of the overall clinical picture, they are not the hallmark indicators of a catecholamine surge characteristic of a pheochromocytoma crisis. Focusing on these less specific findings could delay recognition and treatment of the underlying cause.",
