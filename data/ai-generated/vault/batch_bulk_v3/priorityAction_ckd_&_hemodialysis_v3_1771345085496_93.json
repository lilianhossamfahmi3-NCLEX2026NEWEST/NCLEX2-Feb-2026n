    "correct": "Applying direct, firm pressure to the AVF dressing is the priority. The 4 cm area of bright red drainage indicates active arterial bleeding from the newly placed AVF. Due to the high-pressure arterial flow, significant blood loss can occur rapidly, leading to hypovolemic shock and potential loss of the AVF. Following the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), controlling the hemorrhage (Circulation) is paramount. This prevents further blood loss and stabilizes the client's hemodynamic status. Delaying this intervention can result in life-threatening complications.",
    "incorrect": "While notifying the nephrologist for neurological changes suggestive of Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS), obtaining a blood glucose level, administering an antiemetic, and preparing a normal saline bolus are all relevant actions, they are secondary to addressing the active arterial bleed. DDS is caused by rapid shifts in electrolytes and fluid during dialysis, leading to cerebral edema. Hypoglycemia can cause altered mental status. Nausea is a distressing symptom. Hypotension may require fluid resuscitation. However, none of these address the immediate threat of exsanguination from the AVF.",
