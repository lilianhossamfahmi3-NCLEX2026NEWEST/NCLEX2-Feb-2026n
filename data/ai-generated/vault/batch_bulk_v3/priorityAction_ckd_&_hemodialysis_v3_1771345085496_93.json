Due to the high pressure within an AVF, this bleeding can rapidly lead to significant blood loss, hemorrhagic shock, and loss of the access site. According to the Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) framework, addressing this active hemorrhage (Circulation) is the most immediate life-saving intervention. The nurse must control the bleeding first before addressing other concerns.",

Similarly, obtaining a blood glucose is a reasonable assessment for a confused client with diabetes, and administering an antiemetic addresses a symptom, but neither takes precedence over controlling an active bleed. Preparing an IV bolus may be needed if the client becomes hypotensive, but the priority action is to stop the source of the bleeding.",
