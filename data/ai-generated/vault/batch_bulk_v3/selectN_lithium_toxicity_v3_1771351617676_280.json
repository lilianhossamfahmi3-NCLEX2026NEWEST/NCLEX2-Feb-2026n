        "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of severe lithium toxicity (level 2.1 mEq/L), likely precipitated by dehydration from gastroenteritis and exacerbated by hyponatremia and concurrent lisinopril use. The priority actions are to stabilize the client and facilitate lithium excretion. Initiating IV 0.9% sodium chloride rehydrates the client and corrects the hyponatremia, which promotes renal excretion of lithium. Due to the severe neurological symptoms (confusion, ataxia), seizure precautions are a critical safety measure. With a lithium level above 2.0 mEq/L and significant neurologic impairment, hemodialysis is the definitive treatment, and the nurse must anticipate and prepare for it. An ECG is vital to assess for cardiotoxicity, a known complication of severe lithium toxicity.",
        "incorrect": "Administering lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, would be contraindicated as it can decrease renal clearance of lithium and worsen the toxicity. Encouraging oral fluids is inappropriate and unsafe given the client's altered mental status and ataxia, which pose a significant aspiration risk; IV rehydration is the required route. While other interventions might be considered later, these four actions are the immediate priorities for managing this life-threatening condition.",
