    "pathophysiologyRationale": "Magnesium sulfate acts as a central nervous system depressant, preventing seizures in preeclampsia. However, excessive magnesium levels can depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and potential respiratory arrest. Magnesium also blocks neuromuscular transmission, resulting in decreased deep tendon reflexes. Furthermore, magnesium can affect renal function, leading to decreased urine output. The combination of these effects indicates magnesium toxicity, requiring immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications."
