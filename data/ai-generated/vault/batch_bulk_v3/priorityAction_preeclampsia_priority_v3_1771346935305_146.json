Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant, and toxicity can rapidly progress to respiratory or cardiac arrest. According to safety protocols and the principles of Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC), the most critical and immediate action is to stop the source of the toxicity—the magnesium sulfate infusion—to prevent the client's condition from worsening.",

Administering hydralazine addresses the hypertension but not the impending respiratory depression.

Administering the antidote, calcium gluconate, is a necessary subsequent step, but the priority is to first stop the infusion causing the toxicity.",
