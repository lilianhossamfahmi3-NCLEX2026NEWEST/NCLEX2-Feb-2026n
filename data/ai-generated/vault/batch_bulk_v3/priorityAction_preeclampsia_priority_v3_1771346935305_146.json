Always prioritize stopping the infusion before administering the antidote. Monitor respiratory status closely after discontinuing the infusion. Remember the mnemonic: BURP (BP low, Urine decreased, RR decreased, Patellar reflexes absent).",
        "pathophysiologyRationale": "Magnesium sulfate acts as a central nervous system depressant, preventing seizures in preeclampsia. However, excessive magnesium levels can depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and potential respiratory arrest. Magnesium also blocks neuromuscular transmission, resulting in decreased deep tendon reflexes. Furthermore, magnesium can affect renal function, leading to decreased urine output. The combination of these effects indicates magnesium toxicity, requiring immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.",
        "questionTrap": "Many options may seem reasonable, but the key is to identify the immediate threat to the patient's life. While treating hypertension and preparing for delivery are important, they do not address the immediate respiratory depression caused by magnesium toxicity."

The client reports a worsening headache, blurry vision, and increasing lethargy.\nAssessment: Current vital signs: BP 168/112 mmHg, HR 88/min, RR 10/min, SpO2 93% on room air, Temp 37.1°C. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Urine output is 20 mL/hr via indwelling urinary catheter. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nRecommendation: Immediately stop the magnesium sulfate infusion due to suspected magnesium toxicity. Prepare to administer calcium gluconate 1 g IV. Notify the physician immediately. Closely monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and neurological status."
