A noxious stimulus below the injury triggers an exaggerated sympathetic response. The kinked catheter suggests bladder distention. Initial actions: elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees to lower BP via orthostatic hypotension and relieve the bladder distention by addressing the kinked catheter. Monitor BP every 2-5 minutes and urinary output to assess intervention effectiveness.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect selections are either contraindicated, not a priority, or unrelated to AD. Supine positioning worsens hypertension. Metoprolol is inappropriate for compensatory bradycardia. Stool softeners are not an immediate intervention. Spinal shock presents with hypotension. Malignant hyperthermia involves hyperthermia and muscle rigidity. Increased ICP lacks the specific SCI-related findings. Temperature, skin turgor, and neurological status are not primary parameters for AD resolution.",

  "clinicalPearls": "Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition in patients with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. Key signs include sudden, severe hypertension (often >200 mmHg systolic), bradycardia, headache, flushing above the level of injury, and sweating. Common triggers are bladder distention (e.g., blocked catheter), bowel impaction, and skin irritation. Immediate nursing actions include elevating the head of the bed, identifying and removing the trigger, and monitoring blood pressure closely. Untreated AD can lead to stroke, seizure, or death. Educate patients and caregivers on prevention and early recognition of AD symptoms.",
