        "condition": {
            "C1": "Incorrect. While a DVT can cause leg pain and swelling, the pain is not typically as severe or disproportionate as described. Key signs of compartment syndrome present here are the tense, firm compartment, pain unrelieved by opioids, and early neurologic changes (decreased sensation).",
            "C2": "Correct. The client's presentation is classic for acute compartment syndrome. He has a history of a crush injury, pain out of proportion to the injury that is not relieved by opioids, a tense and swollen muscle compartment, and early signs of neurovascular compromise (pallor, decreased sensation, weak pulse, delayed capillary refill).",
            "C3": "Incorrect. Rhabdomyolysis is a potential complication of crush injuries, leading to myoglobin release and kidney injury. While it can cause muscle pain, it is a systemic condition. The primary problem indicated by the localized, tense swelling and neurovascular signs is compartment syndrome.",
            "C4": "Incorrect. A nerve contusion could explain the decreased sensation. However, it would not account for the extreme pain, tense swelling of the entire compartment, and vascular signs (pallor, weak pulse). The findings are more extensive than isolated nerve damage.",
            "C5": "Incorrect. Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection causing redness, warmth, and swelling. This client's injury was only one hour ago, making an infection highly unlikely. Furthermore, the skin is described as cool and pale, not red and warm, and the swelling is deep and tense rather than superficial."
        },
        "actions": {
            "A1": "Incorrect. Elevating the limb is contraindicated in suspected compartment syndrome. Elevation decreases arterial blood flow into the already compromised compartment, which can worsen ischemia and hasten tissue death.",
            "A2": "Correct. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that can lead to permanent limb and nerve damage or loss of limb if not treated promptly. The nurse must notify the provider immediately for urgent intervention, which is typically a fasciotomy.",
            "A3": "Incorrect. The client's pain is ischemic, caused by nerve compression and muscle hypoxia, not just inflammation or trauma. Opioids are characteristically ineffective for this type of pain, and administering more can mask the progression of symptoms and delay diagnosis.",
            "A4": "Correct. The recommended positioning for a limb with suspected compartment syndrome is at the level of the heart (or slightly below). This position avoids the negative effects of both elevation (decreased arterial inflow) and dependency (increased edema).",
            "A5": "Incorrect. Applying an SCD or any external compression device is strictly contraindicated. This would further increase the pressure within the muscle compartment, worsening the condition and accelerating ischemic injury."
        },
        "parameters": {
            "P1": "Incorrect. Petechiae are small, pinpoint hemorrhages and are not a characteristic sign of compartment syndrome. They are more commonly associated with fat embolism syndrome (a complication of long bone fractures), thrombocytopenia, or vasculitis.",
            "P2": "Correct. A report of a 'pins-and-needles' sensation (paresthesia) is a key early indicator of nerve compression and ischemia in compartment syndrome. This symptom reflects increasing pressure on the sensory nerves within the compartment and is a sign of progression.",
            "P3": "Incorrect. A decrease in calf circumference would indicate a reduction in swelling and pressure, which would be a sign of improvement, not a parameter to monitor for worsening of compartment syndrome. The nurse would expect the circumference to increase as the condition worsens.",
            "P4": "Correct. Pain with passive stretching of the muscles in the affected compartment is a hallmark sign of compartment syndrome. For the lower leg, passively extending (dorsiflexing) the toes stretches the flexor muscles, causing exquisite pain due to ischemia. This is a very sensitive clinical indicator.",
            "P5": "Incorrect. Improvement in pain after opioid administration would be a sign that the condition is NOT compartment syndrome. The pain of compartment syndrome is famously refractory to standard analgesic doses because of its ischemic origin."
