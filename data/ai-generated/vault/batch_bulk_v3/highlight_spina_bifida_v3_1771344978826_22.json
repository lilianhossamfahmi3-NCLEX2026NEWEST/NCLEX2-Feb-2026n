  "stem": "A nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is assessing a newborn delivered 1 hour ago via cesarean section. The newborn was diagnosed prenatally with myelomeningocele. The nurse documents the findings in the electronic health record.",
  "prompt": "Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that require immediate follow-up.",
  "textToHighlight": "A full-term neonate is resting prone in a radiant warmer. Assessment findings include: an axillary temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F). The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat. Over the lumbosacral area, there is a 4 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, fragile membrane. Clear fluid is leaking from the base of the sac. There is flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities with no withdrawal to stimuli. A constant dribbling of urine is noted from the urethral meatus. Acrocyanosis is present on the hands and feet.",

  ],
  "answerBreakdown": {
    "axillary temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F)": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "The newborn's temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F) indicates hypothermia. While maintaining a stable temperature is important, the priority is addressing the myelomeningocele and potential CSF leak to prevent infection. Hypothermia can be addressed by adjusting the radiant warmer and monitoring the neonate's temperature closely.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Maintain a neutral thermal environment to minimize metabolic stress. Monitor temperature every 30 minutes until stable.",
      "pathophysiology": "Newborns, especially preterm infants, have limited ability to regulate their body temperature due to a higher surface area to body mass ratio and decreased subcutaneous fat. Hypothermia can lead to increased oxygen consumption, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia."
    },
    "The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "A soft and flat anterior fontanelle is a normal finding in a newborn. It indicates that the intracranial pressure is within normal limits. A bulging fontanelle would be a concerning sign of increased intracranial pressure, potentially due to hydrocephalus, a common complication of myelomeningocele.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Assess fontanelles regularly for signs of increased intracranial pressure. A sunken fontanelle can indicate dehydration.",
      "pathophysiology": "The fontanelles are soft spots on a newborn's skull that allow for brain growth. They typically close between 9 and 18 months of age. The anterior fontanelle is a valuable assessment tool for evaluating intracranial pressure and hydration status."
    },
    "a 4 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, fragile membrane": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "The 4 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, fragile membrane is the myelomeningocele, a neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through an opening in the vertebrae. This requires immediate protection to prevent rupture and infection. The priority is to keep the sac moist and sterile until surgical repair can be performed.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Position the newborn prone or side-lying to minimize pressure on the sac. Cover the sac with a sterile, non-adherent dressing moistened with sterile saline.",
      "pathophysiology": "Myelomeningocele occurs when the neural tube fails to close completely during fetal development. This results in a defect in the vertebral column and exposure of the spinal cord and meninges. The severity of the defect depends on the location and extent of the opening."
    },
    "Clear fluid is leaking from the base of the sac": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Clear fluid leaking from the base of the sac indicates a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. This is a critical finding because it creates a direct pathway for bacteria to enter the central nervous system, leading to meningitis. Immediate intervention is required to prevent infection and further neurological damage.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, irritability, and lethargy. Obtain a CSF sample for analysis if infection is suspected.",
      "pathophysiology": "CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and nutrients. A CSF leak disrupts the protective barrier and increases the risk of infection. Meningitis can cause severe neurological complications, including brain damage, seizures, and death."
    },
    "flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities with no withdrawal to stimuli": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities with no withdrawal to stimuli indicates significant neurological impairment below the level of the myelomeningocele. This finding suggests damage to the spinal cord and nerves, which can result in permanent motor and sensory deficits. Early intervention, including physical therapy and orthopedic management, is crucial to maximize function and prevent complications.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Assess motor and sensory function regularly to monitor for changes. Provide range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures.",
      "pathophysiology": "The spinal cord transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Damage to the spinal cord can disrupt these signals, leading to paralysis, weakness, and sensory loss. The level of impairment depends on the location and extent of the spinal cord injury."
    },
    "A constant dribbling of urine is noted from the urethral meatus": {
      "isCorrect": true,
      "rationale": "Constant dribbling of urine from the urethral meatus suggests neurogenic bladder, a common complication of myelomeningocele. This occurs due to nerve damage that affects bladder control. The newborn is unable to empty the bladder completely, leading to urinary retention and an increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and kidney damage. Intermittent catheterization may be necessary to ensure complete bladder emptying.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor urine output and assess for signs of urinary retention, such as a distended bladder. Teach parents how to perform intermittent catheterization, if necessary.",
      "pathophysiology": "Neurogenic bladder occurs when the nerves that control bladder function are damaged. This can result in either an overactive bladder (frequent urination) or an underactive bladder (urinary retention). In myelomeningocele, the nerves that control bladder function are often affected, leading to neurogenic bladder."
    },
    "Acrocyanosis is present on the hands and feet": {
      "isCorrect": false,
      "rationale": "Acrocyanosis, or bluish discoloration of the hands and feet, is a common and usually benign finding in newborns during the first 24-48 hours of life. It is caused by immature peripheral circulation and is not directly related to the myelomeningocele. It typically resolves on its own as the circulatory system matures.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Keep the newborn warm to improve circulation. Acrocyanosis should resolve within a few days.",
      "pathophysiology": "Newborns have immature peripheral circulation, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the extremities. This can cause the hands and feet to appear bluish. As the circulatory system matures, blood flow improves, and the acrocyanosis resolves."

    "assessment": "Significant findings include myelomeningocele with CSF leak, neurological deficits (flaccid paralysis, neurogenic bladder), and hypothermia. High risk for infection and neurological complications.",
