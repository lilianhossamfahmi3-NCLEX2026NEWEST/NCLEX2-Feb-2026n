    "stem": "A nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is assessing a newborn delivered 1 hour ago via cesarean section. The newborn was diagnosed prenatally with myelomeningocele. The nurse documents the findings in the electronic health record.",
    "prompt": "Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that require immediate follow-up.",
    "textToHighlight": "A full-term neonate is resting prone in a radiant warmer. Assessment findings include: an axillary temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F). The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat. Over the lumbosacral area, there is a 4 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, fragile membrane. Clear fluid is leaking from the base of the sac. There is flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities with no withdrawal to stimuli. A constant dribbling of urine is noted from the urethral meatus. Acrocyanosis is present on the hands and feet.",

        "axillary temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F)": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This temperature is on the low side of normal (hypothermia). While it requires intervention (e.g., adjusting the radiant warmer), it is a less immediate and critical threat compared to the risk of central nervous system infection from the open lesion."
        },
        "The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This is a normal finding in a newborn. A bulging fontanelle would be a significant cue for increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus, a common complication of myelomeningocele, but a soft, flat fontanelle is a reassuring finding."
        },
        "a 4 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, fragile membrane": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is the primary clinical manifestation of myelomeningocele. It requires immediate protection with a sterile, non-adherent, saline-soaked dressing to prevent rupture, drying, and infection until surgical closure can be performed."
        },
        "Clear fluid is leaking from the base of the sac": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is a critical finding indicating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. An open sac with leaking CSF provides a direct portal of entry for microorganisms into the central nervous system, posing an extremely high risk for meningitis. This requires immediate sterile intervention and notification of the surgical team."
        },
        "flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities with no withdrawal to stimuli": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This finding confirms a significant neurological deficit below the level of the spinal lesion. It is a crucial cue that establishes the baseline for motor function and indicates the severity of the condition, requiring immediate neurosurgical and orthopedic consultation."
        },
        "A constant dribbling of urine is noted from the urethral meatus": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "This is a classic sign of neurogenic bladder, a common complication resulting from nerve damage associated with myelomeningocele. This finding requires immediate follow-up to assess for urinary retention and prevent renal damage."
        },
        "Acrocyanosis is present on the hands and feet": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "This is a common and usually benign finding in a newborn during the first 24-48 hours of life, caused by immature peripheral circulation. It is not directly related to the myelomeningocele and is not considered a priority finding requiring immediate follow-up."
