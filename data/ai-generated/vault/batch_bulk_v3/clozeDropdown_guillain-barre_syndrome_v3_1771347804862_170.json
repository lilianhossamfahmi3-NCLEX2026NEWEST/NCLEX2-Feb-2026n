        "correct": "The correct plan of care for a client with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) prioritizes monitoring for respiratory failure, managing autonomic instability, preventing complications of immobility, and addressing cranial nerve deficits. Respiratory failure due to paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles is the most life-threatening complication. Serial measurement of vital capacity is the gold standard for monitoring the progression of respiratory muscle weakness. Autonomic dysfunction is common, causing labile blood pressure and cardiac dysrhythmias; therefore, continuous cardiac and frequent BP monitoring is essential for early detection and management. Profound paralysis creates a high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), making prophylactic anticoagulation and SCDs a critical intervention. Finally, cranial nerve involvement can lead to dysphagia and communication difficulties, necessitating a formal evaluation by a speech-language pathologist to ensure patient safety and effective communication.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect options represent interventions that are either less specific, not the priority, or potentially unsafe. Simply monitoring respiratory rate or auscultating lungs is insufficient as these are often late indicators of respiratory distress in GBS. Treating isolated episodes of hypertension or tachycardia without continuous monitoring is risky due to the labile nature of autonomic dysfunction. While preventing contractures (passive ROM, splints) and pressure injuries (turning) is important, preventing life-threatening VTE is a higher priority. Initiating a diet without a swallow evaluation is unsafe, and TPN is an invasive measure used only when the GI tract is not functional. A communication board is a good tool, but the comprehensive assessment by an SLP is the first necessary step.",
