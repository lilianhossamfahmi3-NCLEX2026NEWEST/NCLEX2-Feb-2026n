The client's blood pressure is 88/52 mmHg, heart rate is 112/min, and blood glucose is 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L). The client is drowsy but arousable and reports feeling dizzy. Complete the following sentences by choosing the most appropriate option from the dropdown lists.\n\nThe nurse determines the priority is to assess the client's {{blank1}}. Based on this assessment, the nurse should first {{blank2}}. The nurse should anticipate an order for a(n) {{blank3}} if the initial intervention is not effective. Following these interventions, it is most critical to monitor the client's {{blank4}} to evaluate the response to treatment.",

    "correct": "The client's presentation (BP 88/52 mmHg, HR 112/min) indicates hemodynamic instability likely due to abrupt catecholamine withdrawal post-adrenalectomy, leading to vasodilation and relative hypovolemia. Assessing hemodynamic status is paramount. Initial intervention involves a 0.9% sodium chloride bolus to restore intravascular volume. If hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation, a vasopressor infusion (e.g., norepinephrine) is indicated to increase systemic vascular resistance. Continuous monitoring of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is crucial to evaluate treatment effectiveness, aiming for a MAP >65 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion. Hypoglycemia (BG 65 mg/dL) should be addressed, but hypotension poses a more immediate threat.",
    "incorrect": "Assessing pain, surgical site, or neurological status are secondary to addressing the life-threatening hypotension. Administering antihypertensives or diuretics would exacerbate hypotension. While hypoglycemia requires attention, it's less immediately critical than restoring blood pressure. Beta-blockers are contraindicated as they can worsen hypotension. Corticosteroids are important but slower-acting than vasopressors in this acute situation. Urine output and potassium levels are important but provide delayed feedback compared to MAP.",
