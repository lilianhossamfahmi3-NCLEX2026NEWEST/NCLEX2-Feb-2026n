Based on this assessment, the nurse should first {{blank2}}. The nurse should anticipate an order for a(n) {{blank3}} if the initial intervention is not effective. Following these interventions, it is most critical to monitor the client's {{blank4}} to evaluate the response to treatment.",

        "correct": "The client is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, classic signs of cardiovascular instability following the removal of a pheochromocytoma. This occurs due to the abrupt withdrawal of catecholamines, leading to widespread vasodilation. The priority action is to restore intravascular volume with an isotonic fluid bolus (0.9% sodium chloride). If hypotension persists, a vasopressor infusion (e.g., norepinephrine) is necessary to induce vasoconstriction. The most direct and critical parameter to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions is the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), as it reflects systemic vascular resistance and organ perfusion.",
        "incorrect": "Interventions that would worsen hypotension, such as administering an antihypertensive or a diuretic, are contraindicated. While hypoglycemia is a risk and requires monitoring, the profound hypotension is the more immediate life-threatening condition. Standard post-operative care like assessing the surgical site or pain is secondary to managing hemodynamic collapse. Monitoring parameters like urine output and potassium are important but do not provide the immediate feedback on resuscitation efforts that MAP does.",
