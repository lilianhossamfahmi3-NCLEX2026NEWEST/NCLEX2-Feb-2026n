The client is receiving Lactated Ringer's solution at 540 mL/hr. At 1200, the nurse assesses the client and obtains the following data. Which interpretation of these findings is most accurate?",

      "Situation": "A 50-year-old male, weighing 80 kg, with full-thickness burns to the anterior torso and right arm, 4 hours post-burn at 0800.",
      "Background": "The client is receiving Lactated Ringer's solution at 540 mL/hr since the burn injury.",
      "Assessment": "At 1200, the client's vital signs are: HR 128/min, BP 92/58 mmHg, RR 24/min, Temp 36.1°C (97.0°F). Urine output is 20 mL in the last hour.",
      "Recommendation": "Increase the Lactated Ringer's infusion rate. Continuously monitor urine output hourly and titrate fluids to maintain a target urine output of 40-80 mL/hr. Consider central venous pressure monitoring to guide fluid management."

    "correctAnswerRationale": "The client's clinical presentation indicates inadequate fluid resuscitation. The target urine output for an adult burn client is 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr. For this 80 kg client, the target is 40-80 mL/hr. The current urine output of 20 mL/hr, coupled with tachycardia (128/min) and hypotension (92/58 mmHg), suggests hypovolemia. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* Burn injuries cause increased capillary permeability and fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, leading to hypovolemic shock. Inadequate fluid resuscitation results in decreased cardiac output and poor tissue perfusion. The kidneys respond by retaining sodium and water, leading to decreased urine output. Prolonged hypoperfusion can lead to acute kidney injury and multi-organ dysfunction.",
    "distractorRationale": {
      "A": "While prolonged hypoperfusion can lead to acute renal failure (acute kidney injury), the immediate concern is inadequate fluid resuscitation. The oliguria is likely pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia. Addressing the underlying cause of hypoperfusion is the priority. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* Pre-renal azotemia occurs when decreased blood flow to the kidneys impairs their ability to filter waste products. This leads to an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. However, the primary problem is not intrinsic kidney damage but rather inadequate perfusion.",
      "C": "A hypermetabolic state is an expected systemic response to a major burn injury, characterized by increased metabolic rate and catabolism. However, this does not directly explain the acute findings of hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria. These are classic signs of burn shock resulting from massive fluid shifts and intravascular volume depletion. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* The hypermetabolic response is mediated by the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and catecholamines. This leads to increased energy expenditure, protein breakdown, and glucose production. While important, it does not directly cause the acute hemodynamic instability observed in this client.",
      "D": "The client's clinical presentation is the opposite of fluid volume overload. Signs of overload would include hypertension, bounding pulses, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary crackles. The client's findings of hypotension, tachycardia, and low urine output are hallmark signs of hypovolemic shock. \n\n*Pathophysiology:* Fluid volume overload occurs when the body retains excessive fluid, leading to increased intravascular volume and hydrostatic pressure. This can result in pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, and heart failure. The client's current presentation indicates a deficit, not an excess, of intravascular volume."

    "Hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria in a burn patient are red flags for inadequate fluid resuscitation. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent burn shock and organ damage.",
