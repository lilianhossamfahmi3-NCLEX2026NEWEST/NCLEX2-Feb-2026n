    "questionText": "A nurse in the burn unit is caring for a 50-year-old male client who weighs 80 kg and sustained full-thickness burns to his entire anterior torso and right arm approximately 4 hours ago at 0800. The client is receiving Lactated Ringer's solution at 540 mL/hr. At 1200, the nurse assesses the client and obtains the following data. Which interpretation of these findings is most accurate?",

        "correctAnswerRationale": "The most sensitive non-invasive indicator of successful fluid resuscitation in a burn client is urine output. The target urine output for an adult with thermal burns is 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hr. For this 80 kg client, the target is 40-80 mL/hr. The client's current output of 20 mL/hr, combined with tachycardia (128/min) and hypotension (92/58 mmHg), strongly indicates that the intravascular volume is still insufficient to adequately perfuse the kidneys and other vital organs. Although the infusion rate was likely calculated correctly using a standard formula (e.g., Parkland), these formulas are only a starting point. The client's poor response indicates the current rate is inadequate to meet their specific physiological needs, and it must be titrated upwards.",
        "distractorRationale": {
            "A": "While prolonged hypoperfusion can lead to acute renal failure (acute kidney injury), the immediate problem indicated by the oliguria is pre-renal azotemia due to inadequate volume and perfusion. The priority is to correct the cause (under-resuscitation) before irreversible kidney damage occurs. The primary analysis is hypovolemia, not established renal failure.",
            "C": "A hypermetabolic state is an expected systemic response to a major burn injury, characterized by increased metabolic rate and catabolism. However, this response does not directly explain the acute findings of hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria. These are classic signs of burn shock resulting from massive fluid shifts and intravascular volume depletion.",
            "D": "The client's clinical presentation is the opposite of fluid volume overload. Signs of overload would include hypertension, bounding pulses, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary crackles. The client's findings of hypotension, tachycardia, and low urine output are hallmark signs of hypovolemic shock."
