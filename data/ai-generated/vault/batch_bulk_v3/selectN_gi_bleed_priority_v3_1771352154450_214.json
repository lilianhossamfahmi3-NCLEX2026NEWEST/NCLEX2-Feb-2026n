    "question": "The nurse is assessing a 58-year-old male client in the emergency department. The client has a known history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and esophageal varices. He presents with hematemesis of approximately 400 mL of bright red blood over the last hour. The client is pale, diaphoretic, and confused. Based on the assessment findings provided, which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

Establishing two large-bore (e.g., 16- or 18-gauge) IV catheters is essential for rapid administration of fluids and blood products to restore intravascular volume and hemodynamic stability."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This is an incorrect action at this immediate stage. While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like pantoprazole are used in upper GI bleeds, they are primarily for non-variceal bleeding. In a suspected variceal bleed, the priority is controlling hemorrhage with vasoactive drugs (octreotide) and restoring volume. This action is not as urgent as airway management and fluid resuscitation."

        "opt_3": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This is a correct action. The client's altered mental status (confusion) and active hematemesis place him at high risk for aspiration and airway compromise. According to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of resuscitation, ensuring a patent airway is the highest priority. Providing supplemental oxygen is also critical given the SpO2 of 91% and the increased metabolic demand of shock."

        "opt_4": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This is a correct action. The client's vital signs (BP 88/50 mmHg, HR 128 bpm) are indicative of significant hypovolemia. Immediate fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid, such as 0.9% sodium chloride, is crucial to expand intravascular volume, improve blood pressure, and maintain organ perfusion while awaiting blood products."

        "opt_5": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This is a correct action. Given the client's history of cirrhosis and esophageal varices, the bleeding is most likely variceal in origin. Octreotide is a vasoactive drug that reduces splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, thereby helping to control variceal bleeding. It is a first-line pharmacological intervention and should be prepared for immediate administration."

            "isCorrect": false,
            "rationale": "Point-to-Point Rationale: This is an incorrect and potentially harmful action. Inserting a nasogastric tube in a client with known esophageal varices can traumatize the varices and precipitate further, more severe hemorrhage. This procedure is generally contraindicated or performed with extreme caution by an experienced provider in this clinical situation."
