    "question": "The nurse is reviewing the most recent assessment findings for a 68-year-old client who received intravenous alteplase for an acute ischemic stroke 2 hours ago. **Click to highlight** the findings in the nurse's note that are most concerning for a developing complication and require immediate notification of the provider.",
    "prompt": "A 68-year-old client was admitted with left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. Alteplase infusion was completed 2 hours ago. The client is being monitored in the neurological intensive care unit.\n\n**Nurse's Note - 0900**\n**Vitals:** T 99.1°F (37.3°C), HR 88, RR 18. BP was 178/98 mmHg 30 minutes ago; BP is now 192/108 mmHg.\n\n**Neurological:** Client was initially alert and oriented to person and place. Now, the client is increasingly drowsy and difficult to arouse. Client is complaining of a sudden, severe headache, rating it an 8/10. He has had two episodes of projectile vomiting in the last 20 minutes. Moderate expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis persist from initial presentation. Moves left extremities purposefully. PERRLA noted on admission; now there is new onset of left pupil sluggishness to light.\n\n**Other:** Mild oozing of non-sanguineous fluid at the peripheral IV site on the right forearm, dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Cardiac monitor shows sinus rhythm.",
