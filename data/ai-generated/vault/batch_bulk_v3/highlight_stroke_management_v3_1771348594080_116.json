  "question": "The nurse is reviewing the most recent assessment findings for a 68-year-old client who received intravenous alteplase for an acute ischemic stroke 2 hours ago. **Click to highlight** the findings in the nurse's note that are most concerning for a developing complication and require immediate notification of the provider.",
  "prompt": "A 68-year-old client was admitted with left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. Alteplase infusion was completed 2 hours ago. The client is being monitored in the neurological intensive care unit.\n\n**Nurse's Note - 0900**\n**Vitals:** T 37.3°C (99.1°F), HR 88, RR 18. BP was 178/98 mmHg at 0830; BP is now 192/108 mmHg.\n\n**Neurological:** Client was initially alert and oriented to person and place. Now, the client is increasingly drowsy and difficult to arouse. Client is complaining of a sudden, severe headache, rating it an 8/10. He has had two episodes of projectile vomiting in the last 20 minutes. Moderate expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis persist from initial presentation. Moves left extremities purposefully. PERRLA noted on admission; now there is new onset of left pupil sluggishness to light.\n\n**Other:** Mild oozing of non-sanguineous fluid at the peripheral IV site on the right forearm, dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Cardiac monitor shows sinus rhythm.",

Uncontrolled hypertension further elevates this risk by increasing pressure on weakened blood vessels in the brain. The goal BP post-alteplase is generally <180/105 mmHg. Elevated BP can also indicate rising intracranial pressure (ICP).",

This is a significant neurological change that suggests worsening cerebral edema, expanding hemorrhage, or increased ICP. These conditions can lead to brainstem compression and respiratory arrest if not promptly addressed. The change in LOC is a critical indicator of neurological deterioration.",

        "rationale": "Rationale: A sudden, severe headache, especially after thrombolytic therapy, is a hallmark symptom of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The extravasation of blood into the brain tissue or subarachnoid space irritates the meninges, causing intense pain. This symptom requires immediate investigation with a CT scan to rule out bleeding.",

        "rationale": "Rationale: Projectile vomiting, particularly without nausea, is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The pressure stimulates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata, leading to forceful expulsion of stomach contents. This symptom, in conjunction with other neurological changes, warrants immediate intervention to reduce ICP.",

This can be caused by cerebral edema, hematoma formation, or herniation syndrome secondary to increased ICP. Uncal herniation, a life-threatening condition, can occur when the temporal lobe is forced through the tentorial notch, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves.",
