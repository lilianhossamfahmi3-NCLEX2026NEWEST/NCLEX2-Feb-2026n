  "stem": "The nurse in the emergency department is caring for a 68-year-old female client with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis who is diagnosed with myxedema coma. The client is obtunded with the following findings: Temperature 95.2°F (35.1°C), heart rate 52/min, respiratory rate 10/min and shallow, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, SpO2 89% on room air, and blood glucose 58 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L). In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? All actions are appropriate.",

    "Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.",

      {
        "option": "Apply a non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min.",
        "rationale": "The priority is addressing the client's hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) and respiratory depression (RR 10/min, shallow). Myxedema coma causes decreased respiratory drive and alveolar hypoventilation. This leads to CO2 retention and hypoxemia. Applying a non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min delivers a high concentration of oxygen (60-90%), improving oxygen saturation and tissue oxygenation. This intervention directly supports the 'Breathing' component of the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).",
        "clinicalPearls": "In myxedema coma, respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality. Prioritize oxygenation and ventilation support. Be prepared for possible intubation if the client's respiratory status deteriorates despite oxygen administration."
      },
      {
        "option": "Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.",
        "rationale": "After addressing oxygenation, the next priority is circulation. Myxedema coma causes severe bradycardia (52/min) and hypotension (88/50 mmHg) due to decreased cardiac contractility and vasodilation. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows for early detection of life-threatening dysrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, heart block) and assessment of the client's response to interventions. Hypothermia also contributes to cardiac instability.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Bradycardia in myxedema coma is often resistant to atropine. Focus on thyroid hormone replacement and supportive measures. Monitor for signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction, especially during thyroid hormone replacement, as it increases myocardial oxygen demand."
      },
      {
        "option": "Administer 50% dextrose IV as prescribed.",
        "rationale": "Hypoglycemia (58 mg/dL) is a common complication of myxedema coma due to decreased metabolic rate and impaired gluconeogenesis. The brain relies on glucose for energy, and hypoglycemia can worsen altered mental status and cause neuronal damage. Administering 50% dextrose IV rapidly increases blood glucose levels, providing the brain with necessary fuel. Follow agency protocol for managing hypoglycemia.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Always check blood glucose in patients with altered mental status. Myxedema coma can mask or exacerbate hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose frequently after dextrose administration to prevent rebound hypoglycemia."
      },
      {
        "option": "Administer IV levothyroxine as prescribed.",
        "rationale": "IV levothyroxine is the definitive treatment for myxedema coma, replacing the deficient thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) is converted to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, which increases metabolic rate, cardiac output, and respiratory drive. However, its effects are not immediate (takes several hours to days), and it can increase myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, it's administered after addressing immediate life-threatening issues like hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, and hypoglycemia.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Start with a loading dose of IV levothyroxine, followed by daily maintenance doses. Monitor for signs of thyrotoxicosis (e.g., tachycardia, anxiety, tremors) during thyroid hormone replacement. Consider hydrocortisone administration if adrenal insufficiency is suspected."
      },
      {
        "option": "Cover the client with warmed blankets.",
        "rationale": "Hypothermia (95.2°F/35.1°C) is a common finding in myxedema coma due to decreased metabolic rate and impaired thermoregulation. While addressing hypothermia is important, passive rewarming with warmed blankets is the preferred method to prevent rapid vasodilation and worsening hypotension. Active external rewarming (e.g., heating blankets) can cause rapid vasodilation, leading to a further drop in blood pressure and potential cardiovascular collapse.",
        "clinicalPearls": "Avoid active external rewarming in myxedema coma. Monitor core body temperature closely during rewarming. Provide supportive care to prevent shivering, which increases metabolic demand."
