The client is obtunded with the following findings: Temperature 95.2°F (35.1°C), heart rate 52/min, respiratory rate 10/min and shallow, blood pressure 88/50 mmHg, SpO2 89% on room air, and blood glucose 58 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L). In which order should the nurse perform the following actions? All actions are appropriate.",

                "rationale": "The highest priority is to address the client's hypoxemia (SpO2 89%) and respiratory depression (RR 10/min, shallow), which is a direct threat to life. Applying a non-rebreather mask provides the highest concentration of oxygen and is the first step in stabilizing the client's airway and breathing, following the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework."

                "option": "Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.",
                "rationale": "After addressing immediate oxygenation needs, the next priority is circulation. The client's severe bradycardia (52/min) and hypotension (88/50 mmHg) require close monitoring for life-threatening dysrhythmias and to evaluate the response to interventions. This is critical before and during thyroid hormone replacement."

                "option": "Administer 50% dextrose IV as prescribed.",
                "rationale": "Hypoglycemia (58 mg/dL) is a common and dangerous complication of myxedema coma that can exacerbate the client's altered mental status and lead to neuronal damage. Correcting this metabolic emergency is a high priority after stabilizing breathing and circulation."

                "option": "Administer IV levothyroxine as prescribed.",
                "rationale": "This is the definitive treatment to reverse the underlying pathophysiology of myxedema coma. However, it is administered only after life-threatening issues like hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, and hypoglycemia are addressed, as its effects are not immediate and can increase myocardial oxygen demand on an already stressed heart."

                "option": "Cover the client with warmed blankets.",
                "rationale": "While addressing hypothermia is important, passive rewarming with blankets is the appropriate method to prevent rapid vasodilation and worsening hypotension. This intervention is a lower priority than correcting immediate life-threats related to oxygenation, circulation, and glucose levels."
