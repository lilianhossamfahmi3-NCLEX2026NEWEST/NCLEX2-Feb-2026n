        "correct": "During a pheochromocytoma-induced hypertensive crisis, the nurse's priorities are to address the immediate life-threatening cardiovascular risks. This involves placing the client on a cardiac monitor to detect dysrhythmias, preparing to administer an IV alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) to rapidly lower blood pressure, and placing the client in a high-Fowler's position to help reduce BP and ease breathing. Once blood pressure is controlled with alpha-blockade, a beta-blocker is administered to control tachycardia.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect actions include palpating the abdomen (which can worsen the crisis), administering a beta-blocker before an alpha-blocker (which can cause a paradoxical BP spike), or prioritizing non-critical interventions like reducing stimuli over immediate physiological stabilization.
