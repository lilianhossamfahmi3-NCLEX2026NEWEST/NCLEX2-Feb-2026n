  "prompt": "A 45-year-old client is in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for a pituitary adenoma. The nurse's 0700 assessment reveals restlessness, a heart rate of 128/min, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and reports of extreme thirst. The client's urine output has been 8 liters over the past 12 hours. Laboratory results from 0600 show: serum sodium 158 mEq/L (14.8 g/L), serum osmolality 325 mOsm/kg H₂O, and urine specific gravity 1.002. The healthcare provider diagnoses central diabetes insipidus (DI) and provides a set of orders. Which actions should the nurse implement? (Select all that apply)",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs and symptoms of central diabetes insipidus (DI), a condition characterized by a deficiency in the secretion or action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. This deficiency leads to a decreased ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, resulting in massive polyuria (excessive urination), dehydration, hypernatremia (elevated serum sodium), and increased serum osmolality. The underlying pathophysiology involves damage or dysfunction of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which are responsible for ADH production and release. In this case, the recent craniotomy for a pituitary tumor is the likely cause. \n\nThe appropriate nursing actions are aimed at addressing the underlying ADH deficiency, correcting the dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, monitoring fluid status, and ensuring client safety. Administering desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analog of ADH, directly replaces the missing hormone, promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys and reducing urine output. Administering a hypotonic IV solution, such as 0.45% sodium chloride, helps to gradually correct the cellular dehydration and lower the dangerously high serum sodium level. Strict monitoring of intake and output is essential to evaluate the client's response to treatment and prevent fluid overload or persistent dehydration. Due to the severe hypernatremia (158 mEq/L), the client is at high risk for seizures, making seizure precautions a critical safety intervention to prevent injury.",
    "incorrect": "The incorrect options are contraindicated and would cause significant harm to the client. Restricting fluids would exacerbate the client's severe dehydration and worsen hypernatremia. Fluid restriction is an appropriate intervention for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), not DI. Administering hypertonic saline would further increase the already dangerously high serum sodium level, severely increasing the risk of neurological damage, such as central pontine myelinolysis, and seizures. Caffeinated beverages have a diuretic effect and would increase urine output, compounding the fluid volume deficit and worsening dehydration.",
