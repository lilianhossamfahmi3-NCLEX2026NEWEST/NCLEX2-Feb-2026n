    "prompt": "A 45-year-old client is in the intensive care unit following a craniotomy for a pituitary tumor. The nurse's assessment reveals restlessness, heart rate of 128/min, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and extreme thirst. The client's urine output has been 8 liters over the past 12 hours. Laboratory results show: serum sodium 158 mEq/L (14.8 g/L), serum osmolality 325 mOsm/kg H₂O, and urine specific gravity 1.002. The healthcare provider diagnoses central diabetes insipidus (DI) and provides a set of orders. Which actions should the nurse implement? (Select 4)",

        "correct": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of central diabetes insipidus (DI), characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This leads to massive polyuria, dehydration, hypernatremia, and increased serum osmolality. The appropriate nursing actions are to treat the underlying cause, correct the dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, monitor fluid status, and ensure client safety. Administering desmopressin (a synthetic ADH) directly addresses the hormone deficiency. Administering hypotonic IV fluids helps to correct the cellular dehydration and lower the dangerously high serum sodium. Strict monitoring of intake and output is essential to evaluate the client's response to treatment. Due to the severe hypernatremia (158 mEq/L), the client is at high risk for seizures, making seizure precautions a critical safety intervention.",
        "incorrect": "The incorrect options are contraindicated and would cause significant harm. Restricting fluids would exacerbate the client's severe dehydration and worsen hypernatremia. This intervention is appropriate for SIADH, not DI. Administering hypertonic saline would further increase the already dangerously high serum sodium level, severely increasing the risk of neurological damage and seizures. Caffeinated beverages have a diuretic effect and would increase urine output, compounding the fluid volume deficit.",
