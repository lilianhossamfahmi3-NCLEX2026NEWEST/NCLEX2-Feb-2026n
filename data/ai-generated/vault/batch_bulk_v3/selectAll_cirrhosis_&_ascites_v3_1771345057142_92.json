The client presents with tense ascites, 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and shortness of breath. Vital signs are: BP 102/68 mmHg, HR 108/min, RR 24/min, SpO2 91% on room air. Laboratory results show serum albumin 2.5 g/dL, INR 1.8, and ammonia 75 mcg/dL. Which nursing interventions should the nurse prioritize in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

    "rationale": {
        "correct": "The appropriate plan of care for a client with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites focuses on managing fluid volume, monitoring for complications, and preventing secondary issues. This includes administering spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic that is first-line for ascites because it counteracts the hyperaldosteronism seen in cirrhosis. Implementing strict sodium and fluid restrictions is crucial to reduce fluid retention. Daily measurement of abdominal girth and weight provides objective data to track the effectiveness of interventions. Due to massive edema, poor nutrition (hypoalbuminemia), and immobility, the client is at extremely high risk for skin breakdown, making frequent repositioning and skin assessment a priority.",
        "incorrect": "Placing the client in a supine position is contraindicated as the large volume of ascitic fluid will press on the diaphragm, compromising respiratory effort and worsening the client's shortness of breath; a semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position is indicated. Encouraging a high-protein diet is dangerous in this client. The elevated ammonia level (75 mcg/dL) indicates impending or existing hepatic encephalopathy. The damaged liver cannot metabolize protein adequately, and a high-protein load would increase ammonia levels, worsening the client's neurological status.",

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is a correct intervention. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist. In cirrhosis, secondary hyperaldosteronism is a primary driver of sodium and water retention leading to ascites. Spironolactone directly counteracts this mechanism and is the cornerstone of diuretic therapy for ascites."

                "isCorrect": false,
                "explanation": "This is an incorrect and potentially harmful intervention. The client's tense ascites and shortness of breath indicate compromised respiratory function. A supine position increases intra-abdominal pressure against the diaphragm, further limiting lung expansion and exacerbating dyspnea. The client should be positioned in semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position to facilitate breathing."

                "explanation": "This is a correct intervention. Daily measurement of abdominal girth, along with daily weights, is a critical nursing assessment to objectively monitor the accumulation of ascitic fluid and evaluate the client's response to diuretics and dietary restrictions."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is a correct intervention. Sodium restriction is essential to decrease fluid retention, as sodium is a primary driver of fluid shifts into the peritoneal cavity. Fluid restriction is also often necessary, especially in the presence of hyponatremia, to manage total body fluid volume."

                "explanation": "This is an incorrect and dangerous intervention for this specific client. The client's elevated ammonia level (75 mcg/dL) signals impaired hepatic function and risk for hepatic encephalopathy. The liver cannot effectively metabolize protein, leading to the buildup of neurotoxic ammonia. Protein intake must be carefully controlled or restricted, not increased, to prevent worsening mental status."

                "isCorrect": true,
                "explanation": "This is a correct intervention. The client has significant peripheral edema (3+) and low serum albumin (2.5 g/dL), which impairs tissue integrity and healing. These factors, combined with potential immobility, place the client at an extremely high risk for developing pressure injuries. Meticulous skin care and pressure redistribution are essential."
