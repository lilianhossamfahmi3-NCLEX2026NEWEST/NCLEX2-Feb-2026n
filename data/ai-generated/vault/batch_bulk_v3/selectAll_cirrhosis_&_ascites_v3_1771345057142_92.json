  "stem": "The nurse is caring for a 58-year-old client admitted at 1400 with decompensated cirrhosis. The client exhibits tense ascites, 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and shortness of breath. Vital signs at 1415: BP 102/68 mmHg, HR 108/min, RR 24/min, SpO2 91% on room air. Laboratory results: serum albumin 2.5 g/dL, INR 1.8, and ammonia 75 mcg/dL. Which nursing interventions should the nurse prioritize in the plan of care? Select all that apply.",

  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The priority for a client with decompensated cirrhosis, ascites, and shortness of breath is managing fluid overload and preventing complications. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is crucial as it antagonizes aldosterone, which is elevated in cirrhosis, leading to sodium and water retention. Sodium and fluid restrictions are essential to reduce ascites formation. Daily abdominal girth measurements monitor fluid accumulation. Frequent repositioning prevents skin breakdown due to edema and impaired tissue perfusion.",
    "incorrect": "Supine positioning exacerbates respiratory distress by increasing pressure on the diaphragm from ascites. A high-protein diet is contraindicated due to the elevated ammonia level, increasing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. The failing liver cannot effectively metabolize protein, leading to ammonia buildup.",

        "label": "A",
        "content": "Administer spironolactone 100 mg orally as prescribed.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist. In cirrhosis, the failing liver leads to secondary hyperaldosteronism, causing sodium and water retention and ascites. Spironolactone blocks aldosterone's effects in the kidneys, promoting sodium and water excretion. Clinical Pearl: Monitor potassium levels closely, as hyperkalemia is a potential side effect. Pathophysiology: Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilation, decreasing effective circulating volume. This triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in sodium and water retention by the kidneys."

        "label": "B",
        "content": "Place the client in a supine position with legs elevated.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. Supine positioning with leg elevation can worsen respiratory distress. The ascites increases intra-abdominal pressure, which, combined with a supine position, further restricts diaphragmatic excursion and lung expansion. Clinical Pearl: Elevating the legs can increase venous return, potentially worsening fluid overload in a client with compromised cardiac function. Pathophysiology: Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to increased hydrostatic pressure (portal hypertension) and decreased oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia). This fluid pushes against the diaphragm, impairing ventilation."

        "label": "C",
        "content": "Measure abdominal girth daily at the level of the umbilicus.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Daily abdominal girth measurements provide objective data to monitor ascites progression or resolution. Consistent measurement technique is crucial for accurate tracking. Clinical Pearl: Mark the measurement site with a skin marker to ensure consistency. Pathophysiology: Ascites develops due to a combination of factors, including portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and sodium and water retention. Monitoring abdominal girth helps assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing fluid accumulation."

        "content": "Implement a 2-gram sodium and 1.5-liter fluid restriction.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Sodium restriction reduces fluid retention, decreasing ascites and edema. Fluid restriction is often necessary, especially if hyponatremia is present. Clinical Pearl: Educate the client and family about hidden sources of sodium in food. Pathophysiology: Sodium is a major determinant of extracellular fluid volume. Restricting sodium intake reduces the osmotic drive for water retention, decreasing fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity and peripheral tissues."

        "label": "E",
        "content": "Encourage a high-protein, high-calorie diet.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Incorrect. A high-protein diet is contraindicated in the presence of elevated ammonia levels, as it can precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy. The liver's inability to metabolize protein leads to ammonia buildup. Clinical Pearl: Protein intake should be carefully controlled and often restricted in clients with hepatic encephalopathy. Pathophysiology: In liver failure, the liver cannot convert ammonia (a byproduct of protein metabolism) into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Elevated ammonia levels are neurotoxic and contribute to altered mental status and encephalopathy."

        "content": "Reposition the client every 2 hours and assess for skin breakdown.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Correct. Edema, poor nutritional status (low albumin), and immobility increase the risk of skin breakdown. Frequent repositioning and meticulous skin care are essential to prevent pressure injuries. Clinical Pearl: Use pressure-redistributing devices, such as air mattresses, to minimize pressure on bony prominences. Pathophysiology: Edema impairs tissue perfusion, making the skin more vulnerable to breakdown. Hypoalbuminemia reduces oncotic pressure, exacerbating edema and hindering tissue repair."
