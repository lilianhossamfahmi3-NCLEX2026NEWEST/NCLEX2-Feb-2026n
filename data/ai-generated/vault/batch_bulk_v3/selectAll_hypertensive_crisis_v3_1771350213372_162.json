  "question": "A 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to the emergency department by his family due to a sudden onset of a severe, throbbing headache, blurred vision, and increasing confusion over the past two hours. The client reports he ran out of his lisinopril one week ago. The nurse assesses the client and obtains the following vital signs: Blood pressure 234/138 mmHg, Heart rate 112/min, Respiratory rate 22/min, SpO2 95% on room air, Temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F). The healthcare provider prescribes an IV infusion of nitroprusside. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Continuous cardiac and blood pressure monitoring is paramount in hypertensive crisis. Nitroprusside, a potent vasodilator, can cause rapid and unpredictable blood pressure changes. Continuous monitoring, ideally via an arterial line, allows for immediate detection of hypotension or rebound hypertension, enabling prompt adjustments to the infusion rate. The pathophysiology involves the drug's direct action on vascular smooth muscle, reducing systemic vascular resistance and preload. Without close monitoring, critical organ hypoperfusion can occur. Clinical Pearl: Expect orders for arterial line insertion. Titrate nitroprusside per protocol, typically starting at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.",

      {
        "optionId": "opt_2",
        "rationale": "Correct. Nitroprusside must be administered via an infusion pump due to its rapid onset and short half-life. Precise control over the infusion rate is essential to prevent drastic blood pressure fluctuations. The pump ensures a consistent and accurate delivery, minimizing the risk of iatrogenic hypotension or hypertension. The drug's mechanism involves the release of nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation. An uncontrolled infusion can lead to severe complications. Clinical Pearl: Double-check the concentration and infusion rate with another nurse before initiating the infusion.",

        "rationale": "Correct. Frequent neurological assessments are crucial to monitor for signs of hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke, potential complications of hypertensive crisis. The elevated blood pressure can disrupt cerebral autoregulation, leading to cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or ischemia. Neurological assessments, including level of consciousness, pupillary response, and motor function, help detect early changes indicative of neurological deterioration. Clinical Pearl: Document neurological findings meticulously, noting any subtle changes. Prepare for potential interventions such as CT scan of the head.",

      {
        "optionId": "opt_5",
        "rationale": "Correct. Nitroprusside is photosensitive and degrades upon exposure to light, producing cyanide. Protecting the infusion bag from light with an opaque cover is essential to maintain the drug's efficacy and prevent cyanide toxicity. Cyanide inhibits cellular respiration, leading to tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis. Clinical Pearl: Use the manufacturer-provided opaque cover or wrap the bag in aluminum foil. Monitor for signs of cyanide toxicity, such as metabolic acidosis and altered mental status.",

    "incorrect": [
      {
        "optionId": "opt_4",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Rapidly decreasing the MAP by 50% within the first hour is dangerous and can lead to cerebral, coronary, and renal hypoperfusion. The goal is to reduce MAP gradually, typically by no more than 20-25% within the first hour, to avoid ischemic complications. The body's autoregulatory mechanisms are impaired in hypertensive crisis, making it vulnerable to sudden drops in perfusion pressure. Clinical Pearl: Aim for a controlled reduction in blood pressure, balancing the need to lower the pressure with the risk of hypoperfusion.",

        "optionId": "opt_6",
        "rationale": "Incorrect. Encouraging ambulation is contraindicated in this client due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension and falls. The client is hemodynamically unstable and neurologically compromised, making ambulation unsafe. Nitroprusside further increases the risk of hypotension. Clinical Pearl: Maintain strict bed rest and implement fall precautions. Address the client's elimination needs with a bedpan or urinal.",
