    "question": "A 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to the emergency department by his family due to a sudden onset of a severe, throbbing headache, blurred vision, and increasing confusion over the past two hours. The client reports he ran out of his lisinopril one week ago. The nurse assesses the client and obtains the following vital signs: Blood pressure 234/138 mmHg, Heart rate 112/min, Respiratory rate 22/min, SpO2 95% on room air, Temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F). The healthcare provider prescribes an IV infusion of nitroprusside. Which actions should the nurse take immediately? Select all that apply.",

                "rationale": "Correct. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring if available, is essential. Potent IV vasodilators like nitroprusside require frequent, accurate blood pressure readings to allow for precise titration and to prevent precipitous drops in blood pressure, which could lead to hypoperfusion of vital organs."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_2",
                "rationale": "Correct. Nitroprusside is a high-alert medication with a rapid onset and short half-life. An infusion pump is mandatory to deliver the medication at a controlled, precise rate. This prevents accidental bolusing, which could cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_3",
                "rationale": "Correct. The client's presentation with headache, blurred vision, and confusion indicates end-organ damage, specifically hypertensive encephalopathy. Frequent neurological checks (e.g., level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor function) are critical to monitor for improvement or deterioration, such as a stroke."
            },
            {
                "optionId": "opt_5",
                "rationale": "Correct. Sodium nitroprusside is photosensitive and degrades when exposed to light. This degradation can lead to the formation of cyanide, a highly toxic substance. The infusion bag and tubing must be covered with an opaque material, typically provided by the pharmacy, to maintain the drug's efficacy and prevent toxicity."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_4",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The goal in a hypertensive emergency is to lower the mean arterial pressure (MAP) cautiously, typically by no more than 20-25% within the first hour. A rapid 50% decrease would be dangerous, risking cerebral, coronary, and renal hypoperfusion and ischemia due to the body's altered autoregulation."

            {
                "optionId": "opt_6",
                "rationale": "Incorrect. The client is neurologically compromised, hemodynamically unstable, and receiving potent vasodilators. Strict bed rest is required to ensure safety. Ambulation is contraindicated due to the high risk of orthostatic hypotension, syncope, falls, and potential worsening of the neurological status."
