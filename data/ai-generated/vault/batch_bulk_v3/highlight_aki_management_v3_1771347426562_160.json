The client is being treated for acute kidney injury (AKI). Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that require immediate follow-up.",

    "text": "1000: Client is alert but slow to respond to questions. Reports feeling 'more tired than yesterday'. New onset of mild confusion noted. Sternal incision is clean, dry, and intact. Reports incisional pain of 3/10. Apical heart rate is 92 bpm and regular. Blood pressure 138/88 mmHg. Respiratory rate 24/min and slightly labored. Fine crackles auscultated in bilateral lung bases. SpO2 is 93% on 2 L nasal cannula. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds. Last dose of furosemide administered 6 hours ago. Urine output 60 mL over the past 4 hours via indwelling catheter. Morning laboratory results received: Serum potassium 6.2 mEq/L, BUN 58 mg/dL, Creatinine 3.1 mg/dL.",

        "correct": "The nurse should immediately follow up on the new onset of mild confusion, fine crackles in the lung bases, oliguria (60 mL in 4 hours), and hyperkalemia (potassium 6.2 mEq/L). These findings collectively indicate worsening acute kidney injury with life-threatening complications. The confusion may signal uremic encephalopathy, the crackles indicate fluid volume overload and impending pulmonary edema, the oliguria confirms renal failure, and the severe hyperkalemia places the client at high risk for fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.",
        "incorrect": "While the blood pressure needs continued monitoring, 138/88 mmHg is not an emergent finding for a client with a history of hypertension. A clean, dry, and intact incision and a pain level of 3/10 are expected, positive findings that do not require immediate action. These non-critical findings can be addressed after the life-threatening issues have been managed.",
