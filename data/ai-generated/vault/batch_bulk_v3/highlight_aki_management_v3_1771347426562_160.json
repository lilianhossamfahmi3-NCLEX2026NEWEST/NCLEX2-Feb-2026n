  "question": "The nurse is reviewing the electronic health record for a 68-year-old male client on postoperative day 3 following coronary artery bypass grafting. The client is being treated for acute kidney injury (AKI). Click to highlight the findings in the nurse's note that require immediate follow-up.",
  "prompt": "Highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up.",
  "text": "1000: Client is alert but slow to respond to questions. Reports feeling 'more tired than yesterday'. New onset of mild confusion noted. Sternal incision is clean, dry, and intact. Reports incisional pain of 3/10. Apical heart rate is 92 bpm and regular. Blood pressure 138/88 mmHg. Respiratory rate 24/min and slightly labored. Fine crackles auscultated in bilateral lung bases. SpO2 is 93% on 2 L nasal cannula. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds. Last dose of furosemide administered 6 hours ago. Urine output 60 mL over the past 4 hours via indwelling catheter. Morning laboratory results received: Serum potassium 6.2 mEq/L, BUN 58 mg/dL, Creatinine 3.1 mg/dL.",

    "correct": "The nurse must immediately address new confusion, crackles, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. Confusion may indicate uremic encephalopathy from nitrogenous waste buildup due to AKI. Crackles suggest fluid overload and potential pulmonary edema. Oliguria (60 mL/4 hours) confirms worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L) poses a high risk for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent severe complications.",
    "incorrect": "While BP needs monitoring, 138/88 mmHg isn't immediately critical, especially with a history of hypertension. A clean incision and pain of 3/10 are expected post-op and not the priority. These are stable findings that can be addressed after the critical issues.",

        "label": "New onset of mild confusion noted",

Assessment: Confusion, crackles, oliguria, hyperkalemia. Recommendation: Notify provider immediately, anticipate orders for ECG, potassium-lowering medications (e.g., Kayexalate), possible dialysis.",
