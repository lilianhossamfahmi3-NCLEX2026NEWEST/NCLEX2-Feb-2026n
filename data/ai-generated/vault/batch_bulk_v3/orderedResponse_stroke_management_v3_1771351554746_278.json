    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes patient safety and effective alteplase administration. First, confirm the client meets all inclusion criteria and has no contraindications (e.g., active bleeding, recent surgery) to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage. Next, establish a second IV line *before* alteplase administration, as subsequent IV attempts increase bleeding risk. Administer 10% of the calculated alteplase dose as an IV bolus over 1 minute to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels. Then, infuse the remaining 90% over 60 minutes via an infusion pump for precise drug delivery. Finally, perform neurological assessments and vital sign checks every 15 minutes to monitor for complications like intracerebral hemorrhage or angioedema. This sequence ensures timely intervention and minimizes potential harm.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect sequencing can lead to adverse outcomes. Administering alteplase before confirming eligibility risks hemorrhage. Delaying the second IV line increases bleeding risk if needed later. Altering the bolus/infusion sequence affects drug pharmacokinetics and efficacy.
