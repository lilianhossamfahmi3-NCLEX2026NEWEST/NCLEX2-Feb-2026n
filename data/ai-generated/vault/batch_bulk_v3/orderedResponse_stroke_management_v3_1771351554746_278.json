        "correct": "The correct sequence for administering alteplase begins with the most critical safety check: confirming eligibility and absence of contraindications. This prevents catastrophic bleeding in a client who should not receive the drug. Next, peripheral IV access must be secured *before* drug administration, as any invasive procedures (like starting another IV) are contraindicated after alteplase is initiated due to the high risk of bleeding. The administration protocol follows a specific sequence: a 10% bolus over 1 minute to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels, followed by the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes. Finally, vigilant and frequent monitoring (neuro checks and vital signs) must occur concurrently with and after the infusion to rapidly detect any complications, such as intracerebral hemorrhage or angioedema.",
        "incorrect": "Any other sequence introduces significant risk to the client. Administering the drug before confirming eligibility could be fatal if a contraindication like recent major surgery or active bleeding exists. Failing to establish a second IV line beforehand limits the ability to administer other emergency medications or fluids without interrupting the time-sensitive alteplase infusion. Incorrect sequencing of the bolus and infusion alters the drug's pharmacokinetics, potentially reducing efficacy or increasing adverse effects. Delaying frequent monitoring until after the infusion is complete could lead to a missed opportunity to intervene early for life-threatening complications like a brain bleed.",
