    "passage": "An 8-year-old male with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD presents for a scheduled follow-up. The mother reports the client has had a persistent, weak cough for the past week. He tires easily during conversations and seems more fatigued than usual. He uses a wheelchair for long distances but can ambulate short distances with a waddling gait. He continues to exhibit a positive Gower's sign when rising from the floor. His calf muscles appear large and firm. Current medications include daily corticosteroid therapy. Vital signs taken today are: T 98.8°F (37.1°C), P 125/min at rest, R 24/min, SpO2 94% on room air. Physical exam reveals diminished breath sounds in the lung bases bilaterally.",

          "phrase": "persistent, weak cough for the past week",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct. A persistent, weak cough in a client with DMD indicates respiratory muscle weakness and an inability to effectively clear secretions. This increases the risk of pneumonia, atelectasis, and respiratory failure. DMD progressively weakens respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm and intercostals, leading to a reduced ability to generate an effective cough. This can lead to mucus plugging and subsequent infection.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Monitor cough effectiveness and teach assisted cough techniques. Prophylactic antibiotics or airway clearance devices may be needed. Report any changes in sputum color or amount immediately."
        },
        {
          "phrase": "tires easily during conversations",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct. Increased fatigue, especially during minimal exertion like conversation, suggests worsening cardiopulmonary function. This could indicate decreased respiratory reserve or the onset of cardiomyopathy, both life-threatening complications of DMD. DMD affects cardiac muscle, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and decreased cardiac output. Respiratory muscle weakness also contributes to increased work of breathing and fatigue.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Assess for signs of heart failure (edema, jugular venous distension). Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory rate closely. Plan activities with rest periods to conserve energy."
        },
        {
          "phrase": "uses a wheelchair for long distances",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. Wheelchair use for long distances is an expected finding in an 8-year-old with DMD. Loss of ambulation typically occurs between ages 7 and 13 due to progressive muscle weakness. While it indicates disease progression, it is not an acute finding requiring immediate intervention.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Ensure proper wheelchair fit and support. Encourage participation in activities to maintain social interaction and quality of life."
        },
        {
          "phrase": "exhibit a positive Gower's sign",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. Gower's sign (using hands to 'walk' up the legs to stand) is a classic sign of DMD related to pelvic and proximal muscle weakness. In a client with an established diagnosis, this is an expected, chronic finding and does not require immediate follow-up. The weakness in the hip and thigh muscles makes it difficult to rise from the floor without using the arms for assistance.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Educate the family on safe transfer techniques. Encourage range-of-motion exercises to maintain joint flexibility."

        {
          "phrase": "calf muscles appear large and firm",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. This describes pseudohypertrophy, where muscle tissue is replaced by fat and fibrous connective tissue. It is a characteristic and expected physical finding in clients with DMD and does not indicate an acute problem. The muscle fibers are gradually replaced by non-functional tissue, giving the appearance of enlarged muscles.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Explain the nature of pseudohypertrophy to the family. Monitor muscle strength and function regularly."
        },
        {
          "phrase": "daily corticosteroid therapy",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, deflazacort) are the standard of care for DMD to slow the progression of muscle weakness. This is an expected part of the client's treatment plan, not a finding that requires immediate follow-up. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and slow muscle degeneration, improving muscle strength and function.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Monitor for side effects of corticosteroid therapy (weight gain, mood changes, increased risk of infection). Ensure regular bone density screenings."

        {
          "phrase": "P 125/min at rest",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct. Sinus tachycardia is an early sign of cardiomyopathy, a common and fatal complication of DMD. A resting heart rate of 125/min is significantly elevated for an 8-year-old (normal is ~70-110/min) and warrants immediate cardiac evaluation. DMD affects the cardiac muscle, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Tachycardia can be a compensatory mechanism for decreased cardiac output.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Obtain an ECG to assess for arrhythmias. Monitor blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Refer to cardiology for further evaluation and management."
        },
        {
          "phrase": "diminished breath sounds in the lung bases",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct. Diminished breath sounds in the lung bases suggest poor gas exchange and atelectasis, likely due to weakened diaphragm and intercostal muscles. It is a significant indicator of impending respiratory compromise and requires urgent intervention. Weakness of the respiratory muscles leads to shallow breathing and ineffective cough, resulting in mucus plugging and decreased ventilation in the lower lung fields.",
          "clinicalPearls": "Encourage deep breathing and coughing exercises. Consider chest physiotherapy to mobilize secretions. Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory effort closely."
