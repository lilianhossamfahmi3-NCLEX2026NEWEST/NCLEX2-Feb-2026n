        "passage": "An 8-year-old male with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD presents for a scheduled follow-up. The mother reports the client has had a persistent, weak cough for the past week. He tires easily during conversations and seems more fatigued than usual. He uses a wheelchair for long distances but can ambulate short distances with a waddling gait. He continues to exhibit a positive Gower's sign when rising from the floor. His calf muscles appear large and firm. Current medications include daily corticosteroid therapy. Vital signs taken today are: T 98.8°F (37.1°C), P 125/min at rest, R 24/min, SpO2 94% on room air. Physical exam reveals diminished breath sounds in the lung bases bilaterally.",

This involves differentiating between expected findings of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and signs of acute cardiopulmonary decompensation."

                    "isCorrect": true,
                    "explanation": "This is a critical finding. A weak, ineffective cough indicates progressive respiratory muscle weakness, which impairs the client's ability to clear secretions. This significantly increases the risk for atelectasis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure."

                    "explanation": "Increased fatigue, especially with minimal exertion like talking, is a sign of worsening cardiopulmonary function. It can indicate decreased respiratory reserve or the onset of cardiomyopathy, both of which are life-threatening complications of DMD."

                    "explanation": "This is an expected finding for an 8-year-old with DMD. Loss of ambulation typically occurs between ages 7 and 13. While it indicates disease progression, it is not an acute finding requiring immediate follow-up."

                    "explanation": "Gower's sign (using hands to 'walk' up the legs to stand) is a classic, hallmark sign of DMD related to pelvic and proximal muscle weakness. In a client with an established diagnosis, this is an expected, chronic finding."

                    "explanation": "This describes pseudohypertrophy, where muscle tissue is replaced by fat and fibrous connective tissue. It is a characteristic and expected physical finding in clients with DMD and does not indicate an acute problem."

                    "explanation": "Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, deflazacort) are the standard of care for DMD to slow the progression of muscle weakness. This is an expected part of the client's treatment plan, not a finding that requires immediate follow-up."

                    "isCorrect": true,
                    "explanation": "Sinus tachycardia is an early sign of cardiomyopathy, a common and fatal complication of DMD. A resting heart rate of 125/min is significantly elevated for an 8-year-old (normal is ~70-110/min) and warrants immediate cardiac evaluation."

                    "explanation": "This physical exam finding suggests poor gas exchange and atelectasis, likely due to weakened diaphragm and intercostal muscles. It is a significant indicator of impending respiratory compromise and requires urgent intervention."
