The first priority is to correct the life-threatening hypoxemia (SpO2 87%) by applying oxygen. The second step is to obtain baseline coagulation studies (aPTT) before initiating anticoagulation, which is a critical safety measure to guide therapy. The third step is to start the heparin infusion, the primary treatment to prevent further clot growth. Fourth, preparing for the CT angiogram is necessary for definitive diagnosis but occurs after initial stabilization and treatment initiation. The final step is to manage the client's pain with morphine, which is important for comfort but is the lowest priority among these life-saving interventions.",

For example, initiating heparin before drawing a baseline aPTT is unsafe and deviates from standard protocols. Delaying oxygen administration would fail to address the immediate life-threatening hypoxemia. Prioritizing the CT scan or pain management over oxygenation and anticoagulation would delay critical, time-sensitive interventions and could lead to rapid clinical deterioration.",
