    "correct": "The correct sequence prioritizes immediate life-saving interventions for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). First, address the critical hypoxemia (SpO2 87%) by administering oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. This ensures adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs. Second, draw blood for coagulation studies (aPTT) to establish a baseline before initiating anticoagulation therapy. This baseline is crucial for monitoring and adjusting heparin dosage. Third, initiate a continuous intravenous heparin infusion per protocol to prevent further clot formation and embolization. Heparin inhibits thrombin and other clotting factors, preventing the PE from worsening. Fourth, prepare the client for a CT angiogram of the chest to confirm the diagnosis of PE. While important, this is done after initial stabilization. Finally, administer morphine sulfate 2 mg IV for chest pain to improve comfort and reduce anxiety, which can exacerbate respiratory distress.",
