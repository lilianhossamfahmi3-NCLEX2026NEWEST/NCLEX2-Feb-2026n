  "scenario": "A 75-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer is admitted for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) management. He is lethargic and confused.\n\n**Provider's Orders:**\n- Fluid restriction: 800 mL/24 hr\n- Seizure precautions\n- 3% Sodium Chloride at 30 mL/hr via central line\n- Furosemide 20 mg IV now\n\n**Initial Assessment Findings:**\n- Serum Sodium: 114 mEq/L\n- Blood Pressure: 148/92 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 98/min\n- Respiratory Rate: 18/min\n- SpO2: 95% on room air\n- Lungs: Crackles bilaterally at bases\n\nAt 1400, two hours post 3% saline initiation, the nurse finds the client agitated, gasping, with a wet, productive cough of pink, frothy sputum. Respiratory rate is 32/min.",

    "correctRationale": "The client exhibits acute pulmonary edema signs (agitation, dyspnea, tachypnea, pink frothy sputum), a life-threatening hypertonic saline complication. The infusion causes rapid intravascular fluid shifts, overwhelming the heart and causing pulmonary congestion. The priority is stopping the 3% saline to prevent further deterioration. Pulmonary edema occurs when the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries exceeds the oncotic pressure, leading to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space and alveoli. In SIADH, hypertonic saline is used to correct hyponatremia, but rapid correction can lead to osmotic shifts and fluid overload, especially in patients with compromised cardiac function.",
    "distractorRationale": {
      "OPT_A": "Furosemide is appropriate for fluid overload but takes time to act. The immediate action is stopping the causative infusion. While assessing oxygen saturation is important, the client's clinical presentation already indicates severe respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention. Delaying action to obtain a specific SpO2 value is inappropriate when a clear, life-threatening problem is occurring.",
      "OPT_C": "High-Fowler's improves gas exchange and reduces venous return, aiding pulmonary congestion. However, it's supportive. The primary action is eliminating the cause – the ongoing infusion. This should be done immediately after stopping the infusion.",
      "OPT_D": "Activating the RRT is essential for additional resources. However, the nurse must first take the immediate, independent action of stopping the infusion. This directly addresses the cause of deterioration.",
      "OPT_E": "While assessing oxygen saturation is important, the client's clinical presentation (gasping, tachypnea, pink frothy sputum) already provides sufficient data to indicate severe respiratory distress and hypoxia requiring immediate intervention. Delaying action to obtain a specific SpO2 value is inappropriate when a clear, life-threatening problem is occurring. The priority is to intervene to stop the cause."
