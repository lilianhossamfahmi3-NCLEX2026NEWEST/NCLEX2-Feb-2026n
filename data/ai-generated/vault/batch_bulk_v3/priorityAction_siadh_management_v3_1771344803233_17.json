    "scenario": "A 75-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer is admitted to the medical-surgical unit for management of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). The client has been lethargic and confused.\n\n**Provider's Orders:**\n- Fluid restriction of 800 mL/24 hr\n- Seizure precautions\n- Infuse 3% Sodium Chloride at 30 mL/hr via central line\n- Furosemide 20 mg IV now\n\n**Initial Assessment Findings:**\n- Serum Sodium: 114 mEq/L\n- Blood Pressure: 148/92 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 98/min\n- Respiratory Rate: 18/min\n- SpO2: 95% on room air\n- Lungs: Crackles in bilateral bases\n\nTwo hours after the 3% saline infusion is initiated, the nurse enters the room and finds the client is agitated and gasping for breath. The client has a wet, productive cough with pink, frothy sputum. The respiratory rate is now 32/min.",

    },
    "answerBreakdown": {
        "correctRationale": "The client is exhibiting classic signs of acute pulmonary edema (agitation, dyspnea, tachypnea, pink frothy sputum), a life-threatening complication of treatment with hypertonic saline. The infusion is rapidly pulling fluid into the intravascular space, overwhelming the heart's ability to pump and causing fluid to back up into the lungs. The absolute priority is to stop the causative agent, the 3% saline infusion, to prevent the condition from worsening.",
        "distractorRationale": {
            "OPT_A": "Administering furosemide, a loop diuretic, is an appropriate intervention for fluid overload and pulmonary edema. However, it will take time to have a therapeutic effect. The immediate, first action must be to stop the infusion that is causing the acute problem.",
            "OPT_C": "Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position is a critical intervention that will help improve gas exchange and decrease venous return to the heart, thereby reducing pulmonary congestion. However, it is a supportive measure. The primary action is to eliminate the cause of the problem, which is the ongoing infusion. This action should be performed immediately after stopping the infusion.",
            "OPT_D": "Activating the RRT is essential and should be done very quickly to bring additional resources and expertise to the bedside. However, the nurse can and must take the immediate, independent, life-saving action of stopping the infusion first. This takes only a second and directly addresses the cause of the client's deterioration.",
            "OPT_E": "While assessing oxygen saturation is important, the client's clinical presentation (gasping, tachypnea, pink frothy sputum) already provides sufficient data to indicate severe respiratory distress and hypoxia requiring immediate intervention. Delaying action to obtain a specific SpO2 value is inappropriate when a clear, life-threatening problem is occurring. The priority is to intervene to stop the cause."
