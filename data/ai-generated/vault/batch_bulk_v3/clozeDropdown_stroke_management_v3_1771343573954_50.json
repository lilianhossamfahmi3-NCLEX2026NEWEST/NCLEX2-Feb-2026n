The client received intravenous alteplase (tPA) 30 minutes ago. The nurse is performing a neurological assessment and notes the client is now drowsy, complains of a severe headache, and has one episode of vomiting. Vital signs are: BP 200/110 mmHg, HR 58 bpm, RR 14/min, SpO2 95% on room air. The nurse must act immediately. The nurse should first {{blank_1}}, then prepare to administer {{blank_2}}, and position the client by {{blank_3}}.",

The correct sequence of actions is to first stop the offending agent (the alteplase infusion), then manage the severely elevated blood pressure to prevent further bleeding (prepare labetalol), and finally position the client to optimize cerebral venous outflow and decrease intracranial pressure (elevate HOB to 30 degrees). This combination of interventions addresses the root cause, mitigates ongoing damage, and supports physiological stability.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect combinations fail to prioritize the most critical interventions. Obtaining a CT scan before stopping the infusion allows more of the harmful medication to be administered. Choosing medications like mannitol or cryoprecipitate before managing the acute, severe hypertension is not the immediate priority. Incorrect positioning, such as supine or Trendelenburg, can worsen intracranial pressure and is contraindicated.",
