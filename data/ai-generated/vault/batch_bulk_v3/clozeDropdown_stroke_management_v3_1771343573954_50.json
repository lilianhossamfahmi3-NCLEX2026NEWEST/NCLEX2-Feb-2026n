The client received intravenous alteplase (tPA) 30 minutes ago. The nurse is performing a neurological assessment and notes the client is now drowsy, complains of a severe headache, and has one episode of vomiting. Vital signs are: BP 200/110 mmHg, HR 58 bpm, RR 14/min, SpO2 95% on room air. The nurse must act immediately. The nurse should first {{blank_1}}, then prepare to administer {{blank_2}}, and position the client by {{blank_3}}.",

    "correct": "The client is exhibiting signs of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a major complication of alteplase therapy. The sudden onset of drowsiness, severe headache, and vomiting, along with bradycardia and hypertension (Cushing's triad), strongly suggests increased intracranial pressure due to bleeding. The priority is to stop the alteplase infusion immediately to prevent further bleeding. Labetalol is then prepared to aggressively manage the severely elevated blood pressure, aiming for a controlled reduction to prevent hematoma expansion. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees with the head midline promotes venous outflow from the brain, reducing intracranial pressure.",
    "incorrect": "Incorrect combinations fail to prioritize the most critical interventions in the setting of suspected ICH. Delaying the cessation of alteplase or failing to address the hypertension can lead to irreversible neurological damage or death. Incorrect positioning can further exacerbate intracranial pressure.",
