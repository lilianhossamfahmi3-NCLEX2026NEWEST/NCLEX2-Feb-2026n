Started on magnesium sulfate at 2 g/hr per protocol. Assessment: Currently, BP 150/100, HR 88, RR 12, O2 sat 99% on room air. Patient reports feeling 'very tired'. Fetal heart rate 140s, reactive. 07:30 Noted patient somnolent. RR now 10. Urine output decreased to 20 mL/hr since last check. Reflexes absent. Magnesium level pending. Recommendation: STAT magnesium level. Consider holding or decreasing magnesium sulfate infusion. Assess respiratory status closely. Possible need for calcium gluconate if magnesium toxicity is confirmed. Notify physician immediately. Have calcium gluconate at bedside."

  "rationale": {
    "option_1": "Correct. A respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min is a sign of magnesium toxicity, as magnesium sulfate can depress the central nervous system and respiratory function. Immediate intervention is required, potentially including discontinuation of the magnesium sulfate and administration of calcium gluconate.",
    "option_2": "Incorrect. Deep tendon reflexes of 2+ are normal and do not indicate magnesium toxicity. Decreased or absent reflexes are a sign of toxicity.",
    "option_3": "Correct. Urine output of 20 mL/hour is a sign of magnesium toxicity. Magnesium is excreted renally, and decreased urine output can lead to accumulation of the drug and increased toxicity. Normal urine output should be at least 30 mL/hour.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/dL is within the therapeutic range (4-7 mg/dL) for preeclampsia. However, given the patient's other symptoms, this result should be confirmed and the trend monitored closely.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. Blurred vision can be a symptom of preeclampsia itself, but it is not a primary indicator of magnesium toxicity. While it should be noted, it's less immediately concerning than respiratory depression or decreased urine output.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is within normal limits and does not indicate magnesium toxicity.",
    "option_7": "Correct. Absent deep tendon reflexes are a sign of magnesium toxicity. Magnesium sulfate acts as a central nervous system depressant, and loss of reflexes indicates an excessive level of CNS depression."
