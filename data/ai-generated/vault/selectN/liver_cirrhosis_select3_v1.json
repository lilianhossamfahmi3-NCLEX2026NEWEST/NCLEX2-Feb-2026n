Therefore, a high-protein diet is contraindicated as it would precipitate or worsen HE.",

      "optionId": "a",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. In cirrhosis, portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, reducing effective arterial blood volume. This triggers the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), causing the adrenal glands to release aldosterone. Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to promote reabsorption of sodium and water. This pathological fluid retention is the primary driver of ascites. Restricting dietary sodium to ≤2 g/day is a cornerstone of management because it directly counteracts this mechanism, reducing the osmotic pull that retains fluid in the intravascular and interstitial spaces, thereby limiting fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor serum sodium levels closely, as aggressive sodium restriction can lead to hyponatremia. Educate the client on hidden sources of sodium in processed foods."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "b",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Ascites is the accumulation of a large volume of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which significantly increases intra-abdominal pressure. This pressure exerts an upward force on the diaphragm, physically restricting its downward movement during inspiration. This leads to decreased lung expansion, reduced tidal volume, a restrictive breathing pattern, dyspnea, and an increased risk of atelectasis. Placing the client in a semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position utilizes gravity to allow the ascitic fluid and abdominal contents to settle lower in the abdomen, away from the diaphragm. This maximizes diaphragmatic excursion and thoracic capacity, thereby improving ventilation and alleviating the work of breathing. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and breath sounds frequently. Provide supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "c",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. In end-stage cirrhosis, the liver's ability to convert ammonia (a neurotoxin produced by gut bacteria during protein digestion) into urea is severely impaired. Elevated ammonia levels cross the blood-brain barrier, causing hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, works via two mechanisms: 1) It acidifies the colon, which ionically 'traps' ammonia by converting it from absorbable ammonia (NH3) to non-absorbable ammonium (NH4+). 2) Its osmotic effect increases water content in the stool, promoting peristalsis and rapid expulsion of the trapped ammonium. The therapeutic goal of 2-3 soft stools per day indicates effective dosing to prevent the buildup of ammonia without causing excessive fluid and electrolyte loss. **Clinical Pearl:** Monitor for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia) due to excessive lactulose-induced diarrhea. Assess mental status frequently for signs of hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., confusion, asterixis)."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "d",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. This intervention is dangerous for a client with end-stage cirrhosis. The client's failing liver cannot metabolize protein byproducts, specifically ammonia, through the urea cycle. A high-protein diet would lead to an increased production of ammonia by intestinal bacteria, overwhelming the liver's detoxification capacity. The resulting hyperammonemia is directly neurotoxic, leading to the development or worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, a life-threatening complication characterized by confusion, asterixis, and potential coma. Protein intake must be carefully controlled, not maximized, in this client population. **Clinical Pearl:** Collaborate with a registered dietitian to determine the appropriate protein intake based on the client's individual needs and liver function. Monitor serum ammonia levels regularly."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "e",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. This intervention is contraindicated and harmful. Ascites is fluid within the peritoneal cavity, not in the subcutaneous tissue, and cannot be mobilized by external massage. Furthermore, portal hypertension causes the development of fragile, engorged collateral veins in the abdominal wall (caput medusae). Vigorous massage creates a significant risk of rupturing these vessels, leading to severe bleeding. It is also ineffective and can cause significant pain and discomfort to the client whose abdomen is already tense and distended. **Clinical Pearl:** Handle the client's abdomen gently during assessments. Monitor for signs of bleeding, such as bruising or petechiae."
    },
    {
      "optionId": "f",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. While clients with end-stage cirrhosis require rest to conserve energy and reduce metabolic demands on the liver, strict bedrest is not indicated and promotes serious complications. Immobility leads to venous stasis, significantly increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. It also causes muscle atrophy, deconditioning, and increases the risk for pressure injuries, particularly in a client who is often malnourished and edematous. The appropriate intervention is to balance rest with activity as tolerated, such as ambulating to a chair or performing active range-of-motion exercises, to mitigate these hazards. **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage the client to participate in activities as tolerated. Implement measures to prevent skin breakdown, such as frequent repositioning and pressure-reducing surfaces."
