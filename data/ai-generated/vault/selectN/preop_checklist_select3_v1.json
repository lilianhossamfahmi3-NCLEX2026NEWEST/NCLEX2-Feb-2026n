It confirms the client has received information about the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives, and has voluntarily agreed. Proceeding without valid consent constitutes medical battery. Anesthesia induction renders the client incapable of providing consent, so it must be confirmed while they are still competent. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Informed consent is rooted in the ethical principle of autonomy.

A full bladder is displaced superiorly and anteriorly, placing it at high risk for iatrogenic perforation by surgical instruments (trocars, scalpels). Anesthesia-induced muscle relaxation and subsequent urinary retention can exacerbate bladder distention, increasing this risk. A bladder injury can lead to urine leakage into the peritoneum, causing chemical peritonitis and sepsis. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Anesthesia often impairs bladder function, leading to urinary retention. A distended bladder increases the risk of intraoperative injury, especially during procedures involving the lower abdomen or pelvis. Perforation can result in peritonitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the peritoneum.",

Confirming the surgical site has been marked by the licensed independent practitioner performing the procedure is a core component of The Joint Commission's Universal Protocol to prevent wrong-site surgery, a 'never event.' The marking must be unambiguous (e.g., 'YES' or the surgeon's initials), visible after prepping and draping, and done with the client's involvement while awake and alert if possible. This mitigates the risk of human error during complex patient handoffs from the pre-op unit to the surgical team. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Wrong-site surgery is a preventable medical error with devastating consequences. Marking the surgical site provides a visual cue that helps the entire surgical team confirm the correct location before the incision is made. This reduces the likelihood of operating on the wrong body part or performing the wrong procedure.",

A client's cardiopulmonary status can change significantly in a short period. For example, a client could have developed an arrhythmia, new-onset crackles indicating fluid volume excess, or a fever indicating an active infection. Anesthesia induction can have profound hypotensive and respiratory depressant effects, and proceeding without a current baseline assessment (typically within hours of surgery) poses a significant risk of intraoperative cardiovascular collapse or respiratory failure. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** A recent physical assessment is crucial to identify any changes in the patient's condition that could affect their response to anesthesia or surgery.

General anesthesia suppresses the body's protective airway reflexes, such as the gag and cough reflexes. If the client has food or liquid in their stomach, it can be regurgitated and aspirated into the trachea and lungs. This leads to aspiration pneumonitis, a severe chemical inflammation of the lungs, which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has a high mortality rate. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Aspiration pneumonitis occurs when gastric contents enter the lungs, causing inflammation and damage to the lung tissue. The acidic nature of stomach acid can lead to severe chemical burns and impair gas exchange.
