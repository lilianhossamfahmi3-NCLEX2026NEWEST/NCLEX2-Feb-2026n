It confirms the client has received information about the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives, and has voluntarily agreed. Proceeding without valid consent constitutes medical battery. Anesthesia induction renders the client incapable of providing consent, so it must be confirmed while they are still competent."

A full bladder is displaced superiorly and anteriorly, placing it at high risk for iatrogenic perforation by surgical instruments (trocars, scalpels). Anesthesia-induced muscle relaxation and subsequent urinary retention can exacerbate bladder distention, increasing this risk. A bladder injury can lead to urine leakage into the peritoneum, causing chemical peritonitis and sepsis."

Confirming the surgical site has been marked by the licensed independent practitioner performing the procedure is a core component of The Joint Commission's Universal Protocol to prevent wrong-site surgery, a 'never event.' The marking must be unambiguous (e.g., 'YES' or the surgeon's initials), visible after prepping and draping, and done with the client's involvement while awake and alert if possible. This mitigates the risk of human error during complex patient handoffs from the pre-op unit to the surgical team."

While updating the family is an important aspect of family-centered care and communication, it is not a direct patient safety requirement that must be completed on the checklist before transport to the OR.

A client's cardiopulmonary status can change significantly in a short period. For example, a client could have developed an arrhythmia, new-onset crackles indicating fluid volume excess, or a fever indicating an active infection. Anesthesia induction can have profound hypotensive and respiratory depressant effects, and proceeding without a current baseline assessment (typically within hours of surgery) poses a significant risk of intraoperative cardiovascular collapse or respiratory failure."

General anesthesia suppresses the body's protective airway reflexes, such as the gag and cough reflexes. If the client has food or liquid in their stomach, it can be regurgitated and aspirated into the trachea and lungs. This leads to aspiration pneumonitis, a severe chemical inflammation of the lungs, which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has a high mortality rate."
