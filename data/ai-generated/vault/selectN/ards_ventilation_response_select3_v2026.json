Patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. 07:15: Initial settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 10 cm H2O, Tidal Volume 450 mL, RR 28. 08:00: Noted increased work of breathing, decreased SpO2. 08:15: Increased FiO2 to 70%. 08:30: ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 65 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L. 08:45: Chest X-ray reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Static compliance is trending down. Current vent settings: FiO2 70%, PEEP 10, TV 450, RR 28. Patient is on continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl. BP 110/70, HR 110, Temp 38.5 C. Concerns: Worsening respiratory status despite increased FiO2. Requesting evaluation for further ventilator adjustments and consideration of alternative strategies. 09:00: Will check ABG in 30 mins after any vent changes."
