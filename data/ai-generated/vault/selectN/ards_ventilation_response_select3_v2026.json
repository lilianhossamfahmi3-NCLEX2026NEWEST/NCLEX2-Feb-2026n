        "option_1": "Correct: Increased PaCO2 (hypercapnia) indicates inadequate alveolar ventilation. In ARDS, this often results from increased dead space and impaired gas exchange, requiring immediate intervention such as adjusting ventilator settings to increase minute ventilation (e.g., increasing respiratory rate or tidal volume, if appropriate) or addressing underlying causes of increased CO2 production.",
        "option_2": "Incorrect: A decrease in respiratory rate from 28 to 22 breaths/min, while potentially concerning, does not automatically indicate a need for immediate intervention to improve ventilation. It depends on the overall clinical picture and other parameters. If the PaCO2 is rising or remains elevated, then this decrease could be contributing to hypoventilation. However, if the PaCO2 is stable or decreasing, this change may be acceptable. Further assessment is needed to determine the impact on ventilation.",
        "option_3": "Incorrect: An increased PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates improved oxygenation, suggesting that the current FiO2 is effectively delivering oxygen to the alveoli. This finding does not indicate a need for immediate intervention to improve ventilation. Ventilation focuses on CO2 removal, while oxygenation focuses on O2 delivery.",
        "option_4": "Correct: The presence of diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray confirms the diagnosis of ARDS and indicates significant lung injury and inflammation. These infiltrates impair gas exchange and reduce lung compliance, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Immediate intervention is needed to address the underlying inflammation and support ventilation, such as optimizing PEEP, considering prone positioning, or administering medications to reduce inflammation.",
        "option_5": "Correct: Decreased static lung compliance indicates worsening lung stiffness and reduced lung volume, making it more difficult to ventilate the patient. This can result from alveolar edema, atelectasis, or fibrosis, all of which are common in ARDS. Immediate intervention is needed to improve lung mechanics and reduce the work of breathing, such as adjusting ventilator settings to optimize tidal volume and PEEP, considering recruitment maneuvers, or addressing underlying causes of decreased compliance.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect: Increased tidal volume with stable PaCO2 suggests that ventilation is adequate, and CO2 removal is being maintained. This finding does not indicate a need for immediate intervention to improve ventilation. However, it is important to monitor for signs of overdistension or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).",
        "option_7": "Incorrect: SpO2 consistently 88-90%, while suboptimal, primarily reflects an oxygenation issue rather than a ventilation problem. While improving oxygenation is important, the question specifically asks about interventions to improve ventilation. Interventions to improve oxygenation would include increasing FiO2 or PEEP, but these are not directly related to improving ventilation (CO2 removal).",

Test-takers may also be drawn to options that seem generally concerning but do not directly address the immediate need to improve ventilation."
