The pain started approximately 12 hours ago around the umbilicus and has since localized to the right lower quadrant. He also reports nausea and has had one episode of vomiting. 07:05 - B: The client has no significant past medical history. He denies any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors. He reports being in good health prior to the onset of these symptoms. 07:10 - A: The client appears to be in moderate distress due to pain. Physical examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Vital signs are as follows: Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F), HR 110 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, BP 130/80 mmHg, SpO2 98% on room air. Pain is rated as 7/10. 07:15 - R: Suspect possible appendicitis based on the client's presentation and physical exam findings. Recommend immediate surgical consult and further diagnostic testing, including a complete blood count (CBC) and abdominal CT scan. Administer pain medication as prescribed. Monitor vital signs closely and assess the client's pain level frequently."

    "option_1": "CORRECT: Rebound tenderness at McBurney's point is a classic sign of appendicitis due to peritoneal inflammation.",
    "option_2": "INCORRECT: Relief after rupture can occur, but indicates a serious complication requiring immediate intervention to prevent peritonitis.",
    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Generalized abdominal pain may be present early, but the pain localizing to the RLQ is more indicative of appendicitis.",
    "option_4": "CORRECT: An elevated white blood cell count of 15,000/mm³ indicates an inflammatory response, consistent with appendicitis.",
    "option_5": "CORRECT: Pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) is a hallmark symptom of appendicitis as the inflammation becomes localized.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Constipation can be a symptom, but it is not as specific or critical as the other findings."
