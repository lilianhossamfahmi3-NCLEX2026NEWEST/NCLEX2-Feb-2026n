The pain started approximately 12 hours ago around the umbilicus and has since localized to the right lower quadrant. He also reports nausea and has had one episode of vomiting. 07:05 - B: The client has no significant past medical history. He denies any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors. He reports being in good health prior to the onset of these symptoms. 07:10 - A: The client appears to be in moderate distress due to pain. Physical examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Vital signs are as follows: Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F), HR 110 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, BP 130/80 mmHg, SpO2 98% on room air. Pain is rated as 7/10. 07:15 - R: Suspect possible appendicitis based on the client's presentation and physical exam findings. Recommend immediate surgical consult and further diagnostic testing, including a complete blood count (CBC) and abdominal CT scan. Administer pain medication as prescribed. Monitor vital signs closely and assess the client's pain level frequently."

        "option_4": "CORRECT: An elevated white blood cell count of 15,000/mm³ indicates an inflammatory response, consistent with appendicitis and the need for immediate medical evaluation and intervention.",

        "option_6": "INCORRECT: Constipation can be a symptom associated with abdominal issues, but it is not as specific or critical as the other findings related to appendicitis and does not warrant the same level of immediate attention.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: The client presents with signs and symptoms indicative of appendicitis, including right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness at McBurney's point, and an elevated white blood cell count. These findings require immediate attention to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis. Generalized abdominal pain and constipation are less specific and do not warrant the same level of immediate concern. Relief after rupture, while serious, is a later stage complication.",
