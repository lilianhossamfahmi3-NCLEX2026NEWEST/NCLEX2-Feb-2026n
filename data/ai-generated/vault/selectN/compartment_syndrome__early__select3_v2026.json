He had an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery last night. \n\nHis pain is currently rated as an 8 out of 10 despite receiving IV morphine 4mg at 06:00. He states the pain is much worse than before the morphine. He is increasingly restless. \n\nHis vital signs are stable. I'm concerned about possible compartment syndrome. He is complaining of a tight cast. \n\nI recommend the surgical team evaluate him urgently for possible compartment syndrome and consider cast loosening or fasciotomy. I will continue to monitor his pain and neurovascular status closely. I will also elevate the leg and apply ice."

        "option_1": "CORRECT: Pain out of proportion to the injury, especially pain that is not relieved by analgesics, is a classic early sign of compartment syndrome. The increasing pressure within the muscle compartment causes intense pain.",
        "option_2": "CORRECT: Paresthesia (numbness and tingling) is another early sign of nerve compression within the affected compartment. This indicates that the nerves are being affected by the increasing pressure.",
        "option_3": "INCORRECT: Palpable distal pulses are typically present in early compartment syndrome. The absence of pulses is a late sign, indicating severe arterial compression.",
        "option_4": "INCORRECT: A capillary refill of less than 3 seconds is a normal finding and does not suggest compartment syndrome.",
        "option_5": "CORRECT: Passive pain with dorsiflexion (or plantar flexion, depending on the compartment affected) is a key indicator. This maneuver stretches the muscles within the compartment, exacerbating the pain.",
        "option_6": "INCORRECT: Edema is expected after surgery and trauma, but the key is to assess the degree of pain associated with it. While edema can contribute to compartment syndrome, it's not a specific early finding on its own.",
        "option_7": "INCORRECT: Warmth is a normal finding after surgery. The extremity will feel warm. Coolness is a late sign of compartment syndrome.",
        "correct": "The three most likely findings that require immediate intervention are pain out of proportion to the injury, paresthesia in the affected extremity, and passive pain with dorsiflexion. These are early signs of compartment syndrome, indicating increased pressure within the muscle compartment that requires prompt assessment and intervention to prevent irreversible damage.",

The '6 Ps' (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Pressure) are often taught, but pulselessness and paralysis are late signs. Pain out of proportion to the injury and pain with passive stretching are the most sensitive early indicators."
