        "opt_1": "Correct. A systolic blood pressure of 210 mmHg is a hallmark sign of autonomic dysreflexia and requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as stroke or seizure. The elevated blood pressure is a direct result of the uninhibited sympathetic response below the level of the spinal cord injury.",
        "opt_2": "Correct. Bradycardia (heart rate of 52 bpm) is a common finding in autonomic dysreflexia due to the baroreceptor reflex attempting to lower blood pressure. The body is trying to compensate for the dangerously high blood pressure.",
        "opt_3": "Correct. Flushed face and upper chest are indicative of vasodilation above the level of the spinal cord injury, a characteristic sign of autonomic dysreflexia. This is due to the body's attempt to dissipate heat and lower blood pressure above the level of the lesion.",
        "opt_4": "Correct. Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) above the level of the spinal cord injury is another key sign of autonomic dysreflexia due to the uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response. The body is attempting to regulate temperature and blood pressure.",
        "opt_5": "Incorrect. Feeling cold and clammy is not typically associated with autonomic dysreflexia, which usually presents with flushing and sweating above the level of injury. Cold and clammy skin suggests hypoperfusion or shock, which are not primary features of autonomic dysreflexia.",
        "opt_6": "Incorrect. An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is within normal limits and does not indicate autonomic dysreflexia. While maintaining adequate oxygenation is important, it is not a primary concern in the immediate management of autonomic dysreflexia.",
        "opt_7": "Incorrect. While a headache is a symptom of autonomic dysreflexia, it is not as immediately critical as the vital sign abnormalities and other physical findings. Addressing the underlying cause of the autonomic dysreflexia is the priority.",
        "correct": "The correct findings indicate the presence of autonomic dysreflexia, a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. The combination of severe hypertension, bradycardia, flushing, and diaphoresis above the level of injury are classic signs. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent severe complications.",
