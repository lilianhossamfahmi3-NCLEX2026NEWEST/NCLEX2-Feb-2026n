        "content": "Situation: 62-year-old male, Mr. Jones, admitted for altered mental status. He has a history of seizures, but is not compliant with medications. Background: Per EMS, patient was found unresponsive at home, with witnessed tonic-clonic seizure activity lasting approximately 5 minutes prior to their arrival. Assessment: On arrival to ED at 14:15, patient is postictal, drowsy but arousable to painful stimuli. GCS is 10. Vitals: HR 120, BP 180/100, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity noted. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to stop the seizures, including IV access, administration of benzodiazepines, and preparation for possible intubation. Continuous EEG monitoring should be initiated as soon as possible to assess seizure burden. The patient's medication history indicates non-compliance with anti-epileptic drugs. Family reports he stopped taking his medication because he felt 'fine'. Repeat doses of lorazepam may be required. Notify neurology and critical care. Ensure airway patency and protect from injury. Consider loading dose of fosphenytoin or valproic acid after the seizures stop. Check labs, especially electrolytes, glucose, and anticonvulsant levels. Review code status with family once patient is stable."

    "option_1": "CORRECT: Lorazepam is a first-line benzodiazepine used to rapidly stop seizure activity in status epilepticus. It enhances GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: Inserting an oropharyngeal airway will maintain airway patency during seizure activity, preventing hypoxia and aspiration. DO NOT insert anything into the mouth if the jaw is clenched.",
    "option_3": "CORRECT: Preparing for endotracheal intubation is crucial, as the patient may require respiratory support due to depressed level of consciousness or persistent seizure activity. The priority is always ABCs.",
    "option_4": "INCORRECT: Obtaining a STAT serum phenytoin level is important, but is not an immediate action. The priority is to stop the seizures first.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: Continuous EEG monitoring is essential for assessing seizure burden and response to treatment, but is not an immediate action in the initial management.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Assessing pupillary response is part of the neurological assessment, but is not the priority during active seizure activity.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Restraints are contraindicated during a seizure, as they can cause injury. The focus should be on protecting the patient from injury."
