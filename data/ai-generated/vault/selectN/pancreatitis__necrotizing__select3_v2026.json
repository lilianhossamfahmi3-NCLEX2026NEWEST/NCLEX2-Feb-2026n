Blood pressure is trending downward, currently 88/50 mmHg. 07:20 Physical exam reveals new onset of ecchymosis on the flanks. Oxygen saturation is 92% on 2L nasal cannula. 07:30 Pain level remains at 6/10 despite ordered analgesics. Labs are pending. 07:40 Orders include continuous cardiac monitoring, IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. 07:50 He is at high risk for septic shock. 08:00 Continue to monitor vital signs closely and assess for further deterioration. Contact provider with any significant changes. Be prepared to administer vasopressors if needed. Anticipate transfer to ICU. Closely monitor respiratory status and be prepared to assist with intubation if needed. Consider central line placement. Monitor urine output hourly. Ensure all medications are administered as prescribed. Strict NPO status. Monitor lab results closely."
