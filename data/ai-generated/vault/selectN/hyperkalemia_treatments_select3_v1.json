      "content": "CORRECT: Calcium gluconate is administered IV at 1405 to immediately counteract the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia reduces the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes, increasing excitability and the risk of arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate increases the threshold potential, stabilizing the cardiac membrane. Clinical Pearl: Monitor EKG continuously during administration. Rapid administration can cause hypotension. Pathophysiology: Hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization of the cell membrane, making it more excitable. Calcium increases the threshold potential, requiring a larger stimulus to depolarize the cell, thus stabilizing the membrane and preventing arrhythmias.",

      "content": "CORRECT: Intravenous insulin with dextrose 50% is administered IV at 1410 to shift potassium into cells, temporarily lowering serum levels. Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, moving potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space. Dextrose 50% prevents hypoglycemia. Clinical Pearl: Monitor blood glucose levels closely. Pathophysiology: Insulin binds to receptors on skeletal muscle cells, activating the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This pump actively transports potassium into the cell, decreasing serum potassium. Dextrose is co-administered to prevent hypoglycemia, a common side effect of insulin administration.",

It exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the colon, which is then excreted in feces. Clinical Pearl: Monitor for constipation and bowel function. Pathophysiology: Kayexalate is a cation-exchange resin. In the colon, it binds to potassium, exchanging it for sodium. The potassium-bound resin is then excreted, effectively removing potassium from the body. This process is slower than other treatments but essential for long-term potassium control.",

Clinical Pearl: Never administer potassium to a hyperkalemic patient unless severe hypokalemia is present and carefully monitored.

Clinical Pearl: Avoid potassium-sparing diuretics in hyperkalemic patients.

      "content": "INCORRECT: Magnesium sulfate is not a primary treatment for hyperkalemia. While magnesium is important for cardiac function, it does not directly address the elevated potassium level or stabilize the cardiac membrane in the same way as calcium. Clinical Pearl: Magnesium is used for specific arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes or confirmed hypomagnesemia, not hyperkalemia. Pathophysiology: Magnesium primarily affects cardiac cell excitability and contractility but does not directly lower serum potassium levels or counteract the effects of hyperkalemia on the cardiac membrane potential.",

    "title": "The 'Stabilize, Shift, & Shed' Trap",
    "content": "The critical error in managing severe hyperkalemia is failing to address the three distinct therapeutic goals in the correct order of priority: 1) Stabilize the heart, 2) Shift potassium into cells, and 3) Shed (remove) potassium from the body. Candidates often incorrectly select only a removal agent (like Kayexalate) or confuse the roles of calcium and magnesium. The EKG changes (peaked T-waves) signify imminent cardiac arrest, making cardiac membrane stabilization with calcium gluconate the absolute first priority, even before lowering the potassium level. The trap is selecting interventions that don't match the urgency of the cardiac threat."
