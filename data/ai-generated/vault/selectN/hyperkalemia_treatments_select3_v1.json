The priority is to stabilize the cardiac membrane with intravenous calcium gluconate to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. Next, intravenous insulin with dextrose 50% is administered to shift potassium into cells, temporarily lowering serum levels. Finally, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is administered to remove potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract.
