History of hypertension and cataract surgery 5 years ago. No known allergies. ASSESSMENT: Patient complains of flashes of light and floaters, followed by a gradual loss of peripheral vision in the right eye. Reports seeing a 'curtain' obstructing his vision. Visual acuity significantly decreased in the right eye. Vitals: BP 160/90, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 95% on room air. No pain reported. Pupils are equal and reactive, but right pupil reacts sluggishly. Patient is anxious about vision loss. 08:00 Labs pending. 08:05 Ophthal consult pended. RECOMMENDATION: Stat ophthalmology consult for possible retinal detachment. Prepare patient for potential surgical intervention. Keep NPO after midnight. Administer antiemetic as needed. Provide emotional support."

    "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden flashes of light or floaters are indicative of vitreous traction on the retina, which can precede retinal detachment and requires immediate attention.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: Gradual loss of peripheral vision is a classic sign of retinal detachment as the retina separates from the choroid. This requires immediate intervention to prevent further vision loss.",
    "option_3": "CORRECT: The sensation of a 'curtain' or 'veil' obstructing vision is a hallmark symptom of retinal detachment and necessitates immediate ophthalmological evaluation.",
    "option_4": "INCORRECT: Mild eye discomfort is not a primary symptom of retinal detachment. While some discomfort may be present, it is not the most concerning finding.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: Increased tearing and redness are not specific to retinal detachment and may indicate other conditions such as conjunctivitis or dry eye.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: PERRLA indicates normal pupillary function and does not suggest retinal detachment. A sluggish pupillary response in the affected eye would be more concerning.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Difficulty focusing on near objects is more indicative of presbyopia or other refractive errors and is not directly related to retinal detachment.",
