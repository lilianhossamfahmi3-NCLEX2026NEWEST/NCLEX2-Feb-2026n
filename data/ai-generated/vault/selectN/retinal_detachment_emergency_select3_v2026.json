History of hypertension and cataract surgery 5 years ago. No known allergies. ASSESSMENT: Patient complains of flashes of light and floaters, followed by a gradual loss of peripheral vision in the right eye. Reports seeing a 'curtain' obstructing his vision. Visual acuity significantly decreased in the right eye. Vitals: BP 160/90, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 95% on room air. No pain reported. Pupils are equal and reactive, but right pupil reacts sluggishly. Patient is anxious about vision loss. 08:00 Labs pending. 08:05 Ophthal consult pended. RECOMMENDATION: Stat ophthalmology consult for possible retinal detachment. Prepare patient for potential surgical intervention. Keep NPO after midnight. Administer antiemetic as needed. Provide emotional support."

  "rationale": {
    "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden flashes of light or floaters can indicate vitreous traction on the retina, a common precursor to retinal detachment.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: Gradual loss of peripheral vision is a classic symptom of retinal detachment as the retina progressively separates from the choroid.",
    "option_3": "CORRECT: The sensation of a 'curtain' or 'veil' being drawn over the field of vision is a hallmark sign of retinal detachment.",
    "option_4": "INCORRECT: Eye pain is not typically associated with retinal detachment. Pain might suggest other conditions like angle-closure glaucoma or iritis.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: While increased tearing can occur with various eye irritations, it is not a primary symptom of retinal detachment.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: PERRLA indicates normal pupillary function. While the affected eye might show a sluggish response, PERRLA itself is not indicative of retinal detachment.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Difficulty reading small print is more indicative of presbyopia or other refractive errors and is not directly related to retinal detachment.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
