He has a history of hypertension and underwent cataract surgery 5 years ago. No known allergies. ASSESSMENT: The patient describes flashes of light and floaters, followed by a gradual loss of peripheral vision in the right eye. He reports seeing a 'curtain' obstructing his vision. Visual acuity is significantly decreased in the right eye. Vitals at 07:30: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 95% on room air. He denies pain. Pupils are equal and reactive, but the right pupil reacts sluggishly. The patient expresses anxiety about potential vision loss. Labs were drawn at 08:00 and are pending. An ophthalmology consult was requested at 08:05. RECOMMENDATION: Request stat ophthalmology consult for possible retinal detachment. Prepare the patient for potential surgical intervention. Maintain NPO status after midnight. Administer antiemetics as needed. Provide emotional support and reassurance."

    "rationale": {
        "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden flashes of light or floaters are indicative of vitreous traction on the retina, a common precursor to retinal detachment. As the vitreous pulls on the retina, it can cause these symptoms. Immediate attention is needed to assess the risk of detachment. ClinicalPearl: Patients often describe floaters as small specks or clouds moving in their field of vision. QuestionTrap: These symptoms can be transient and benign, leading to a delay in seeking care. Mnemonic: Imagine 'FLASHing' lights and 'FLOATing' objects as warning signs.",
        "option_2": "CORRECT: Gradual loss of peripheral vision, often described as a curtain or shadow spreading across the visual field, is a classic sign of retinal detachment. This occurs as the retina separates from the underlying choroid, disrupting blood supply and function. ClinicalPearl: The visual field defect corresponds to the area of detachment. QuestionTrap: Patients may attribute this to fatigue or eye strain, delaying treatment. Mnemonic: Think of a 'CURTAIN' slowly closing as vision fades.",
        "option_3": "CORRECT: The sensation of a 'curtain' or 'veil' obstructing vision is a hallmark symptom of retinal detachment. It signifies a significant portion of the retina has detached, blocking the transmission of visual information to the brain. ClinicalPearl: This symptom is often painless but profoundly alarming to the patient. QuestionTrap: Patients may describe this symptom vaguely, so probing questions are essential. Mnemonic: Picture a 'VEIL' descending over the eye, obscuring sight.",
        "option_4": "INCORRECT: Mild eye discomfort is not a primary symptom of retinal detachment. While some discomfort may be present, it is usually overshadowed by the more dramatic visual disturbances. ClinicalPearl: Pain is more common in other eye conditions, such as glaucoma or uveitis. QuestionTrap: Focusing on pain can distract from the critical visual symptoms. Mnemonic: Retinal detachment is more about 'SIGHT' than 'FIGHT' (pain).",
        "option_5": "INCORRECT: Increased tearing and redness are not specific to retinal detachment and may indicate other conditions such as conjunctivitis or dry eye. These symptoms are related to surface irritation or inflammation, not the deeper retinal pathology. ClinicalPearl: Rule out other common causes of red eye before considering retinal detachment. QuestionTrap: These symptoms are common and can mislead the nurse away from the correct diagnosis. Mnemonic: Tearing and redness are more likely 'INFLAMED' than 'DETACHED'.",
        "option_6": "INCORRECT: PERRLA indicates normal pupillary function and does not suggest retinal detachment. While a sluggish pupillary response in the affected eye might be concerning, PERRLA is a normal finding. ClinicalPearl: Pupillary response is more affected by neurological issues or direct trauma. QuestionTrap: A normal finding can create false reassurance. Mnemonic: 'PERRLA' is 'PERFECT', not problematic.",
        "option_7": "INCORRECT: Difficulty focusing on near objects is more indicative of presbyopia or other refractive errors and is not directly related to retinal detachment. This is a common age-related change in vision. ClinicalPearl: Presbyopia affects near vision, while retinal detachment affects overall visual field. QuestionTrap: This symptom is common and can distract from the critical symptoms. Mnemonic: 'NEAR' vision problems are usually 'NORMAL' with age.",
        "correct": "Retinal detachment is a medical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. The classic symptoms include sudden flashes of light, floaters, and a curtain-like loss of vision. These symptoms result from the separation of the retina from the underlying choroid, disrupting the blood supply and neural connections necessary for sight. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to reattach the retina and restore vision.",

Focus on the hallmark symptoms of flashes, floaters, and curtain-like vision. Remember that retinal detachment is often painless but causes significant visual disturbances."
