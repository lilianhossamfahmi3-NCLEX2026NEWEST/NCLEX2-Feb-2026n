Background: The patient's pre-operative hemoglobin was 12.8 g/dL. He has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Allergy to sulfa drugs. Assessment: At 14:15, approximately 15 minutes after the transfusion started, the patient reports sudden onset of lower back pain and chills. His vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, Temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). The patient appears anxious and is flushed. Recommendation: The nurse suspects a hemolytic transfusion reaction and needs immediate orders."

    "a": "Correct: Hypotension is a key sign of hemolytic transfusion reaction due to vasodilation and shock.",
    "b": "Incorrect: Tachycardia, not bradycardia, is associated with hemolytic reactions as the body attempts to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery.",
    "c": "Correct: Back pain is a classic symptom of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in the kidneys.",
    "d": "Incorrect: Hypotension, not hypertension, is expected in hemolytic reactions due to vasodilation and shock.",
    "e": "Correct: Fever and chills are common early signs of hemolytic transfusion reactions, indicating an immune response.",
    "f": "Incorrect: Anxiety is a non-specific symptom. While the patient may feel anxious, this is not a primary indicator of a hemolytic transfusion reaction and other signs should be prioritized.",
    "g": "Incorrect: Flushing is a non-specific symptom. While the patient may appear flushed, this is not a primary indicator of a hemolytic transfusion reaction and other signs should be prioritized.",
