He has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Allergy to sulfa drugs.\nAssessment: At 14:15, approximately 15 minutes after the transfusion started, the patient reports sudden onset of lower back pain and chills. His vital signs are: BP 90/50 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on 2L nasal cannula, Temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). The patient appears anxious and is flushed.\nRecommendation: The nurse suspects a hemolytic transfusion reaction and needs immediate orders."

        "c": "Correct: Back pain is a classic symptom of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in the kidneys. The patient's report of sudden onset of lower back pain is a critical finding.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Hypotension, not hypertension, is expected in hemolytic reactions due to vasodilation and shock. The patient's BP decreased.",
        "e": "Correct: Fever and chills are common early signs of hemolytic transfusion reactions, indicating an immune response. The patient's temperature increased from 37.0°C (98.6°F) to 38.5°C (101.3°F).",
        "f": "Incorrect: Anxiety is a non-specific symptom. While the patient may feel anxious, this is not a primary indicator of a hemolytic transfusion reaction and other signs should be prioritized. Other findings are more specific to a hemolytic reaction.",
