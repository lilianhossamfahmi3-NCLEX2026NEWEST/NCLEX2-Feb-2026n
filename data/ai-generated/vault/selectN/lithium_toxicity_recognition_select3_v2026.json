She has been on lithium for several years. 07:00 B: Patient presented with increased manic symptoms including racing thoughts, pressured speech, and decreased need for sleep. Lithium dose was adjusted yesterday. Baseline serum lithium level yesterday at 17:00 was 0.8 mEq/L. Patient also takes lisinopril for hypertension. 07:00 A: Patient appears increasingly confused this morning. She is experiencing some mild nausea. Noted a new onset of tremors. Vital signs are stable. 07:00 R: Recommend checking a current serum lithium level immediately and notifying the physician of these changes. Assess neurological status frequently. Consider holding the next dose of lithium pending lab results. Monitor for worsening symptoms. Maintain hydration."
