    "option_3": "Correct. Irregular respiratory patterns, such as Cheyne-Stokes respirations, are indicative of pressure on the brainstem and are a component of Cushing's triad.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. Pupils equal and reactive to light are normal findings and do not indicate increased ICP. Sluggish or non-reactive pupils are more concerning.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. Increased body temperature is not typically associated with Cushing's triad. It may indicate infection or other systemic issues, but it's not a primary sign of increasing ICP.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. Decreased diastolic blood pressure, along with increased systolic pressure, leads to a widened pulse pressure, but diastolic pressure alone decreasing is not indicative of Cushing's triad.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. A mild headache is a common symptom, but in the context of potential increased ICP, the vital sign changes are more indicative of the emergent situation."
