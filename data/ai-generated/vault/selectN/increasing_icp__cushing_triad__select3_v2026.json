        "option_4": "Incorrect. While the left pupil is sluggish, pupils that are equal and reactive to light (PERRLA) are normal findings and do not indicate increased ICP. Sluggish or non-reactive pupils are more concerning, but the question asks for the MOST LIKELY findings requiring immediate intervention based on the client's presentation, and the vital signs are more indicative of immediate danger.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect. Increased body temperature is not typically associated with Cushing's triad. It may indicate infection or other systemic issues, but it's not a primary sign of increasing ICP. The vital signs are more indicative of immediate danger.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect. Decreased diastolic blood pressure, while contributing to a widened pulse pressure when the systolic pressure is elevated, is not independently the most concerning finding. The combination of increased systolic pressure and decreased heart rate and irregular respirations are more indicative of Cushing's triad.",
