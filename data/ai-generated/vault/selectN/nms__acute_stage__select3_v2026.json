Background: He was started on haloperidol 5mg PO BID on admission. He has a history of medication non-compliance. Assessment: This morning, the patient's temperature is 104°F (40°C). He is diaphoretic and exhibits significant muscle rigidity. His blood pressure is fluctuating between 160/100 and 120/80. He is less responsive than usual. Labs are pending. Recommendation: I am concerned about possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). I recommend immediate discontinuation of haloperidol, stat labs including CPK, and transfer to ICU for close monitoring and management. Consider dantrolene or bromocriptine administration. Hydration and cooling measures should be initiated immediately. Notify the attending physician STAT. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and cardiac rhythm is essential. The patient's mental status should be frequently assessed and documented. Further neurological evaluation may be warranted. Investigate any recent changes in medication or dosage. Review the patient's history for previous episodes of similar symptoms. Ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation support. Prepare for potential complications such as rhabdomyolysis or renal failure. Psych consult recommended post stabilization. 07:15 - Attending notified."

    "opt1": "Correct: Hyperthermia is a key diagnostic criterion for NMS, often presenting with temperatures above 104°F (40°C). Immediate intervention is required to prevent complications.",
    "opt2": "Incorrect: While diaphoresis can occur, pallor is less specific and less critical than other findings in NMS. These findings alone do not necessitate immediate intervention.",
    "opt3": "Correct: Muscle rigidity, particularly 'lead-pipe' rigidity, is a hallmark sign of NMS. This requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as rhabdomyolysis.",
    "opt4": "Incorrect: A normal heart rate is not consistent with NMS. Tachycardia is more commonly observed. This finding does not require immediate intervention in the context of suspected NMS.",
    "opt5": "Correct: Fluctuating or labile blood pressure is a common autonomic dysfunction observed in NMS. This instability requires immediate intervention to stabilize the patient.",
    "opt6": "Incorrect: This is a non-specific symptom and not a key indicator of NMS. It does not require immediate intervention.",
    "opt7": "Incorrect: Elevated CPK is a consequence of muscle damage and supports the diagnosis of NMS, but it is not a primary diagnostic finding that necessitates IMMEDIATE intervention. Hyperthermia, rigidity, and labile BP require more immediate action.",
    "correct": "The most likely findings requiring immediate intervention in Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) are sudden onset of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and fluctuating blood pressure. These symptoms indicate a critical state requiring immediate medical attention to prevent severe complications and potential mortality. While elevated CPK is an important diagnostic marker, it is a result of the underlying pathophysiology and not a primary target for immediate intervention."
