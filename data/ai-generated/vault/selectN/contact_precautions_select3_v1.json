    "pathophysiology": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exhibits resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics due to the *mecA* gene, which encodes a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a). This altered protein has a low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. MRSA's ability to colonize the skin and nares, coupled with its prolonged survival on surfaces (fomites), facilitates its transmission via direct and indirect contact. Virulence factors, such as toxins and biofilm formation, contribute to its persistence in healthcare settings. Contact precautions are crucial to create physical barriers (gloves, gowns) and contain the organism within a defined space (private room), thereby preventing its spread.",

These measures are consistent with contact precautions for MRSA. Placing the client in a private room minimizes the risk of transmission to other clients. A gown protects the nurse's uniform and skin from contamination. Hand hygiene is the most critical measure to prevent the spread of pathogens.",

Candidates may incorrectly select 'surgical mask' (droplet precautions) or 'sterile gloves' (sterile procedure). Another trap is choosing the most restrictive option, 'restrict all visitors,' believing it is the safest, when educating visitors on PPE is the standard of care."
