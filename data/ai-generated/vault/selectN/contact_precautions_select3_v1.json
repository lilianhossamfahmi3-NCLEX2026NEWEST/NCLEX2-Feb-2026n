            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a correct action. MRSA is transmitted via direct and indirect contact. The organism readily colonizes skin and can be shed into the client's immediate environment, contaminating bed rails, tables, and equipment. A private room physically contains this colonized environment, preventing fomite (inanimate object) transmission to other clients, who may be immunocompromised or have invasive devices that would serve as portals of entry."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect action. MRSA transmission from a wound is through contact, not via the respiratory droplet route. A surgical mask is designed to block large particle droplets expelled during coughing or sneezing (e.g., influenza). Its use for a client with a MRSA wound is an unnecessary consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE) and does not address the primary mechanism of transmission."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect action. Sterile gloves are required only for aseptic procedures that breach sterile body cavities (e.g., urinary catheterization, central line care). For routine contact with a client's intact skin or their environment under contact precautions, clean (non-sterile) gloves provide a sufficient barrier to prevent hand contamination. Using sterile gloves is cost-prohibitive, wasteful, and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the principles of medical asepsis versus surgical asepsis."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a correct action. A gown serves as an impermeable barrier protecting the nurse's uniform and skin from contact with the MRSA organism. As the nurse provides care, their clothing can easily brush against contaminated linens or surfaces. Without a gown, the nurse's uniform becomes a fomite, facilitating the transport of MRSA out of the client's room and posing a risk of cross-contamination to other clients."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a correct action. Hand hygiene is the single most critical measure to prevent the transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Even with proper glove use, hands can become contaminated during glove removal or through undetected micro-perforations. Alcohol-based hand rubs rapidly kill MRSA by denaturing its proteins and disrupting the lipid cell membrane. Performing hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves eliminates any transient bacteria, breaking the chain of infection."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This is an incorrect action. Completely restricting visitors is an extreme measure that can cause psychosocial distress and is not standard protocol. The goal is to contain the pathogen, not isolate the person. Visitors should be educated on performing hand hygiene and donning a gown and gloves if they anticipate direct contact with the client or contaminated surfaces. This approach balances infection control with the client's need for social support."
        }
    },
    "pathophysiology": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Its resistance is primarily due to the mecA gene, which codes for a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a). This altered protein has a low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. MRSA is highly transmissible via contact because it effectively colonizes the skin and nares and can survive on dry surfaces (fomites) for extended periods. Its virulence factors, including toxins and the ability to form biofilms on surfaces and medical devices, contribute to its persistence in the healthcare environment. Therefore, contact precautions are essential to create physical barriers (gloves, gowns) and contain the organism within a defined space (private room) to prevent its spread.",
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap in this question is confusing the different types of transmission-based precautions. Candidates may incorrectly select 'surgical mask,' which is for droplet precautions, or 'sterile gloves,' which confuses the requirements of routine care with those of a sterile procedure. Another trap is choosing the most restrictive option, 'restrict all visitors,' believing it is the safest, when in fact, educating visitors on proper PPE use is the standard of care that supports both safety and patient well-being.",
    "mnemonics": "For Contact Precautions, remember 'MRS. WEE':\n\n*   **M** - Multidrug-resistant organisms (MRSA, VRE)\n*   **R** - Respiratory infections (RSV - transmitted by contact with secretions)\n*   **S** - Skin infections (Scabies, Shingles, Impetigo)\n*   **W** - Wound infections (with uncontained drainage)\n*   **E** - Enteric infections (C. difficile, Norovirus)\n*   **E** - Eye infections (Conjunctivitis)\n\nRequired PPE: Private room, Gown, and Gloves. Hand hygiene is always required."
