    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "This is a correct action. Placing the client in a private room minimizes the risk of MRSA transmission to other clients and healthcare personnel. MRSA is spread through direct and indirect contact. A private room contains the organism, preventing fomite transmission. (+1 point)"
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect action. MRSA is primarily transmitted through direct contact, not respiratory droplets. A surgical mask is unnecessary and does not address the primary transmission route. (-1 point)"
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect action. Sterile gloves are only required for sterile procedures. Clean gloves are sufficient for routine contact with a client under contact precautions. Using sterile gloves is wasteful and demonstrates a misunderstanding of medical asepsis. (-1 point)"
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "This is a correct action. A gown protects the nurse's uniform and skin from contact with MRSA. Without a gown, the nurse's uniform can become a fomite, facilitating the spread of MRSA. (+1 point)"

    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "This is a correct action. Hand hygiene is the most critical measure to prevent the transmission of pathogens. Alcohol-based hand rubs rapidly kill MRSA. Performing hand hygiene after removing gloves eliminates transient bacteria. (+1 point)"

      "correct": false,
      "content": "This is an incorrect action. Restricting all visitors is an extreme measure. Visitors should be educated on hand hygiene and PPE use. This balances infection control with the client's need for social support. (-1 point)"

  "pathophysiology": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exhibits resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics due to the *mecA* gene, which encodes a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a). This altered protein has a low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. MRSA's ability to colonize the skin and nares, coupled with its prolonged survival on surfaces (fomites), facilitates its transmission via direct and indirect contact. Virulence factors, such as toxins and biofilm formation, contribute to its persistence in healthcare settings. Contact precautions are crucial to create physical barriers (gloves, gowns) and contain the organism within a defined space (private room), thereby preventing its spread.",
  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is confusing transmission-based precautions. Candidates may incorrectly select 'surgical mask' (droplet precautions) or 'sterile gloves' (sterile procedure). Another trap is choosing the most restrictive option, 'restrict all visitors,' believing it is the safest, when educating visitors on PPE is the standard of care.",
  "mnemonics": "For Contact Precautions, remember 'MRS. WEE':\n\n*   **M** - Multidrug-resistant organisms (MRSA, VRE)\n*   **R** - Respiratory infections (RSV - transmitted by contact with secretions)\n*   **S** - Skin infections (Scabies, Shingles, Impetigo)\n*   **W** - Wound infections (with uncontained drainage)\n*   **E** - Enteric infections (C. difficile, Norovirus)\n*   **E** - Eye infections (Conjunctivitis)\n\nRequired PPE: Private room, Gown, and Gloves. Hand hygiene is always required.",
  "clinicalPearls": "*   Always perform hand hygiene before and after patient contact, even when wearing gloves.\n*   Ensure proper donning and doffing of PPE to prevent self-contamination.\n*   Educate patients and visitors on the importance of contact precautions and proper hand hygiene.\n*   Monitor for signs and symptoms of MRSA infection, such as localized redness, swelling, and purulent drainage.\n*   Implement environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols to minimize MRSA contamination on surfaces.",
