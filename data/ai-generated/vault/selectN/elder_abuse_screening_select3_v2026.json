Noted multiple bruises on upper arms and torso in various stages of healing. Weight loss of 10 lbs in the last month, poor skin turgor. Patient hesitant to speak when daughter is present. Daughter states patient is 'just getting old'. Denies any falls or injuries. \nRecommendation: Recommend further evaluation for possible elder abuse and neglect. Consider social work consult and a safe discharge plan. Current orders include a CBC, CMP, UA, and a geriatric assessment consult. Daughter is resistant to the consult."

The question asks for findings that require *further investigation*, and this statement alone is not sufficient without other supporting evidence.",

        "option_4": "Correct. Unexplained weight loss and signs of malnutrition can indicate neglect, which is a form of elder abuse. This requires further investigation to determine the cause and ensure the patient's well-being.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect. Orientation to person, place, and time indicates intact cognitive function and does not suggest elder abuse. This is a normal finding.",
        "option_6": "Correct. Hesitancy to speak openly in the presence of the caregiver can be a sign that the elder is afraid or intimidated by the caregiver, suggesting possible abuse. This behavior warrants further investigation.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect. Clear speech and appropriate affect are normal findings and not indicative of elder abuse. This does not warrant further investigation for abuse.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: The scenario presents an elderly patient with several findings suggestive of elder abuse, including physical injuries (bruises), signs of neglect (weight loss, malnutrition), and behavioral indicators (hesitancy to speak in front of the caregiver). These findings warrant immediate further investigation to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
