He has a history of COPD and hypertension.\nAssessment: Patient is increasingly lethargic. Temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, and systolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. He is now confused and disoriented, which is a new finding. White blood cell count is 9,000/μL. Urine output has decreased significantly over the past 6 hours. The patient is currently on IV fluids and antibiotics (ceftriaxone).\nRecommendation: I am concerned about possible sepsis. I recommend ordering a lactate level, blood cultures, and considering a fluid bolus. Would also like orders for vasopressors if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation. Please advise urgently."
