He underwent ORIF at 06:30. \n\nPatient is now reporting increased shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air, down from 98% pre-op. A new petechial rash is noted on his chest and axillae. Patient is increasingly confused and disoriented; he is unable to state his name. \n\nRelevant history includes no known allergies. He is currently on IV fluids at 100 mL/hr and morphine 2mg IV every 2 hours PRN for pain. Pain level is currently reported as 7/10. \n\nI am concerned about possible fat embolism syndrome given the recent fracture and the sudden onset of respiratory distress, petechiae, and altered mental status. I recommend immediate arterial blood gas analysis and consideration for increased oxygen support, possibly intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory status deteriorates. STAT consult with pulmonology is recommended. I will continue to monitor vital signs and neurological status closely. Physician Smith notified at 07:05."

        "option_1": "CORRECT: Dyspnea is a key respiratory manifestation of fat embolism syndrome due to fat globules obstructing pulmonary capillaries, leading to impaired gas exchange. The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate support this finding.",
        "option_2": "CORRECT: Petechial rash is a classic dermatological sign of fat embolism syndrome, caused by fat emboli and thrombocytopenia. This rash typically appears on the chest, axillae, and conjunctiva. The SBAR and Physical Exam tabs confirm the presence of this rash.",
        "option_3": "INCORRECT: Increased urine output is not typically associated with fat embolism syndrome. Oliguria or normal urine output is more common due to hypovolemia and decreased renal perfusion. The provided data does not indicate increased urine output.",
        "option_4": "CORRECT: Altered mental status and confusion occur due to cerebral fat emboli, leading to neurological dysfunction and impaired cognitive function. The SBAR and Physical Exam tabs indicate the patient is confused and disoriented.",
        "option_5": "INCORRECT: Tachycardia, not bradycardia, is commonly seen in fat embolism syndrome as a compensatory mechanism for hypoxemia and hypovolemia. The Vitals tab shows the patient has a heart rate of 110 bpm, indicating tachycardia.",
        "option_6": "INCORRECT: While stress hyperglycemia can occur in trauma, it is not a primary diagnostic criterion for fat embolism syndrome. There is no data provided to indicate elevated blood glucose.",
        "option_7": "INCORRECT: Fever can occur due to the inflammatory response, but it is not part of the classic triad. Respiratory distress, neurological dysfunction, and petechiae are the hallmark signs. While the patient has a fever, it is less specific than the other findings.",
        "correct": "The classic triad of fat embolism syndrome includes respiratory distress (dyspnea), neurological dysfunction (altered mental status), and petechial rash. The patient's presentation in the provided data strongly suggests fat embolism syndrome, necessitating immediate notification of the physician.",
