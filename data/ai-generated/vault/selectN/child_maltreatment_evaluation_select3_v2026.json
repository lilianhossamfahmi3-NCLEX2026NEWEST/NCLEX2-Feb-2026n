He lives at home with his parents and a 4-year-old sibling. The family has no known social services involvement. The caregiver is anxious and gives conflicting information about the fall. 08:00: Initial assessment reveals a spiral fracture of the femur. Bruising is noted on his back and buttocks. Caregiver states that the bruising occurred a few days ago when he was playing outside. 12:00: Labs are pending. Vitals are stable. 16:00: Radiology confirms a spiral fracture. 18:00: The care team is concerned about the mechanism of injury and the presence of multiple bruises. 20:00: Social work has been consulted. \n**A**ssessment: Possible non-accidental trauma is suspected due to the inconsistent history and the nature of the injuries.

        "option_1": "Correct. Spiral fractures in non-ambulatory infants are highly suspicious for child maltreatment due to the force required to cause such a fracture. The SBAR indicates a spiral fracture of the femur in an 18-month-old, and the caregiver's explanation of a fall from the couch is inconsistent with the injury.",
        "option_2": "Incorrect. Bruising on the shins is common in toddlers who are learning to walk and explore their environment. It is often accidental and not typically indicative of abuse. The physical exam notes bruising on the back and buttocks, which are more concerning.",
        "option_3": "Correct. Multiple bruises of varying ages, especially on the back and buttocks, are red flags for potential abuse as they are not typical locations for accidental injuries. The physical exam confirms these findings, raising suspicion for non-accidental trauma.",
        "option_4": "Incorrect. While concerning, reports of being left unsupervised are related to neglect, which is another form of child maltreatment, but not directly related to physical injury patterns. The question asks about findings that require investigation for potential child maltreatment based on the clinical data provided.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect. A radial fracture from a fall from playground equipment is a common accidental injury in children. The SBAR indicates the caregiver's explanation of the injury is inconsistent with the findings.",
        "option_6": "Correct. Delay in seeking medical care for a significant injury is a concerning sign, as it may indicate an attempt to conceal the injury or a lack of concern for the child's well-being. The SBAR indicates the patient presented to the ED at 23:30 with a reported leg injury, and the care team is concerned about the mechanism of injury.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect. Sibling rivalry is a common occurrence and, while it can sometimes lead to minor injuries, it is not typically indicative of child maltreatment. The focus should be on the physical findings and inconsistencies in the caregiver's story.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: The clinical data presents several red flags for potential child maltreatment, including a spiral fracture in a non-ambulatory infant, multiple bruises of varying ages on the back and buttocks, and a delay in seeking medical care for a significant injury. These findings, combined with the inconsistent history provided by the caregiver, warrant further investigation and evaluation for child maltreatment.",
