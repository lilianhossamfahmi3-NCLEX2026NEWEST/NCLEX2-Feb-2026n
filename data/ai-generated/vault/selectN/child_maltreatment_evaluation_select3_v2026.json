Caregiver states he 'fell off the couch'.\n**B**ackground: Liam has no significant past medical history. He is up-to-date on his immunizations. He lives at home with his parents and a 4-year-old sibling. The family has no known social services involvement. The caregiver is anxious and gives conflicting information about the fall. 08:00: Initial assessment reveals a spiral fracture of the femur. Bruising is noted on his back and buttocks. Caregiver states that the bruising occurred a few days ago when he was playing outside. 12:00: Labs are pending. Vitals are stable. 16:00: Radiology confirms a spiral fracture. 18:00: The care team is concerned about the mechanism of injury and the presence of multiple bruises. 20:00: Social work has been consulted. \n**A**ssessment: Possible non-accidental trauma is suspected due to the inconsistent history and the nature of the injuries. The injuries are inconsistent with the reported mechanism.\n**R**ecommendation: I recommend a thorough child maltreatment evaluation, including skeletal survey and further social work assessment. Ensure patient safety and consider protective custody if necessary."

    "option_3": "Correct. Multiple bruises of varying ages, especially on the back and buttocks, are red flags for potential abuse as they are not typical locations for accidental injuries.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. While concerning, reports of being left unsupervised are related to neglect, which is another form of child maltreatment, but not directly related to physical injury patterns.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. A radial fracture from a fall from playground equipment is a common accidental injury in children.",
    "option_6": "Correct. Delay in seeking medical care for a significant injury is a concerning sign, as it may indicate an attempt to conceal the injury or a lack of concern for the child's well-being.",
