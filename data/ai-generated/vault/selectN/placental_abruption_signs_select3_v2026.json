Minimal fetal movement noted.\n14:05: B: Patient has a history of controlled gestational hypertension. Previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. Denies trauma.\n14:10: A: Patient appears pale, anxious, and reports pain level of 8/10. Abdomen is rigid and tender to palpation. Continuous fetal monitoring in place. FHR showing late decelerations. Moderate dark red vaginal bleeding noted. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air.\n14:15: R: Notify physician immediately. Prepare for possible emergency cesarean section. Administer oxygen via face mask. Initiate IV fluid bolus."

    "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden onset of intense abdominal pain is a hallmark symptom of placental abruption due to the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, causing significant discomfort and indicating a potential emergency.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: A rigid, board-like abdomen indicates uterine irritability and concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption. The rigidity is a result of blood accumulating within the uterine muscle.",
    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Painless vaginal bleeding is more characteristic of placenta previa, not placental abruption. Placental abruption typically presents with painful bleeding due to the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall.",
    "option_4": "CORRECT: Fetal heart rate decelerations indicate fetal distress due to decreased oxygen supply resulting from placental separation. This is a critical finding that requires immediate intervention to prevent fetal hypoxia.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: While elevated blood pressure can be a contributing factor to placental abruption, it is not a direct finding that requires immediate intervention in the context of an acute abruption. The patient already has a history of hypertension, and the other findings are more indicative of the acute event.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Fundal height being consistent with gestational age does not directly indicate placental abruption. It is a normal finding and does not contribute to the immediate assessment of the patient's condition.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Dark red vaginal bleeding is a finding in placental abruption; however, the intense abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, and fetal heart rate decelerations are the PRIORITY findings that indicate the severity of the abruption and fetal compromise.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale: Placental abruption is a life-threatening condition for both the mother and fetus. The priority findings that require immediate intervention are sudden onset of intense abdominal pain, a rigid, board-like abdomen, and fetal heart rate decelerations. These findings indicate the severity of the abruption and the potential for fetal hypoxia. While dark red vaginal bleeding is also a sign of placental abruption, it is not as critical as the other three findings."
