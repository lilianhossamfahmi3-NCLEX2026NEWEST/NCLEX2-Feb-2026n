Minimal fetal movement noted. 14:05: B: Patient has a history of controlled gestational hypertension. Previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. Denies trauma. 14:10: A: Patient appears pale, anxious, and reports pain level of 8/10. Abdomen is rigid and tender to palpation. Continuous fetal monitoring in place. FHR showing late decelerations. Moderate dark red vaginal bleeding noted. Vital signs: BP 160/100 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 96% on room air. 14:15: R: Notify physician immediately. Prepare for possible emergency cesarean section. Administer oxygen via face mask. Initiate IV fluid bolus."

    "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden onset of intense abdominal pain is a hallmark symptom of placental abruption due to the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: A rigid, board-like abdomen indicates uterine irritability and concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption.",
    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Painless vaginal bleeding is more characteristic of placenta previa, not placental abruption. Placental abruption typically presents with painful bleeding.",
    "option_4": "CORRECT: Fetal heart rate decelerations indicate fetal distress due to decreased oxygen supply resulting from placental separation.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: While elevated blood pressure can be a contributing factor to placental abruption, it is not a direct finding that requires immediate intervention in the context of an acute abruption. The patient already has a history of hypertension.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Fundal height being consistent with gestational age does not directly indicate placental abruption. It is a normal finding.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Dark red vaginal bleeding is a finding in placental abruption; however, the intense abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, and fetal heart rate decelerations are the PRIORITY findings."
