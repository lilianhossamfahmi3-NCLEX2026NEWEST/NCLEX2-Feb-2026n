B: Patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension. Admitted yesterday for workup, including 24-hour urine catecholamines. A: Possible pheochromocytoma crisis. Currently symptomatic with elevated blood pressure and heart rate. R: Requesting immediate orders for IV antihypertensives (phentolamine), continuous cardiac monitoring, and frequent vital sign checks. Rule out other causes of hypertensive crisis. Consider labetalol if phentolamine unavailable. Monitor closely for hypotension following medication administration. Needs quiet environment. Neurovascular checks q1h. Maintain strict I/O. Notify provider of any significant changes. Continue to assess pain level and administer pain medication as prescribed. 07:15 MD notified. Orders received and implemented. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Phentolamine IV bolus administered."

  "rationale": {
    "opt1": "Correct: A blood pressure of 220/130 mmHg indicates severe hypertension, a hallmark of pheochromocytoma crisis, requiring immediate intervention to prevent end-organ damage such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or kidney failure. The priority is to rapidly lower the blood pressure with appropriate medications like phentolamine or labetalol.",
    "opt2": "Correct: A heart rate of 140 bpm signifies tachycardia, driven by excessive catecholamine release in a pheochromocytoma crisis. This increased heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and can lead to arrhythmias. Immediate management with medications to control heart rate and blood pressure is crucial.",
    "opt3": "Incorrect: A serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L is within the normal range (3.5-5.0 mEq/L) and does not require immediate intervention in the context of a pheochromocytoma crisis. While electrolyte imbalances can occur, this value is not critical.",
    "opt4": "Correct: Severe headache is a common symptom of pheochromocytoma crisis due to the rapid and extreme elevation in blood pressure. While pain management is important, addressing the underlying cause of the headache (hypertension) is the priority. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to hemorrhagic stroke.",
    "opt5": "Incorrect: A blood glucose of 110 mg/dL is within normal limits (70-110 mg/dL) and not directly indicative of a pheochromocytoma crisis. While hyperglycemia can sometimes be associated with pheochromocytoma, this value is not critical and does not require immediate intervention.",
    "opt6": "Incorrect: While anxiety and restlessness are common symptoms of pheochromocytoma crisis due to the surge of catecholamines, they are less specific and less immediately life-threatening than severely elevated blood pressure or tachycardia. Addressing the physiological symptoms is the priority.",
    "opt7": "Incorrect: Urine output of 50 mL/hr is generally within the normal range (30-60 mL/hr) and does not indicate immediate kidney dysfunction in this context. While monitoring urine output is important, it is not the priority in this acute crisis.",
    "correct": "The patient is experiencing a pheochromocytoma crisis, characterized by a sudden release of catecholamines, leading to severe hypertension, tachycardia, and headache. The priority is to address the elevated blood pressure and heart rate to prevent end-organ damage. While anxiety and headache are important symptoms, they are secondary to the life-threatening vital sign abnormalities."

  "clinicalPearls": "Pheochromocytoma crisis presents with hyperadrenergic symptoms. Prioritize assessing and managing severely elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Remember the '5 Ps' of pheochromocytoma: Pressure (high BP), Pain (headache), Perspiration, Palpitations, and Pallor. Alpha-adrenergic blockade (e.g., phentolamine) is the first-line treatment.",
  "questionTrap": "Students may focus on anxiety or headache and miss the critical vital sign abnormalities that require immediate action. The question tests the ability to prioritize interventions in a crisis situation. Students may also confuse the symptoms of pheochromocytoma crisis with other conditions, such as anxiety disorders or migraine headaches.",
