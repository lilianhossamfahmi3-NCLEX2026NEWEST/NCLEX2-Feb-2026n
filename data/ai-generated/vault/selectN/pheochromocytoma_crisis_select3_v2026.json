B: Patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension. Admitted yesterday for workup, including 24-hour urine catecholamines. A: Possible pheochromocytoma crisis. Currently symptomatic with elevated blood pressure and heart rate. R: Requesting immediate orders for IV antihypertensives (phentolamine), continuous cardiac monitoring, and frequent vital sign checks. Rule out other causes of hypertensive crisis. Consider labetalol if phentolamine unavailable. Monitor closely for hypotension following medication administration. Needs quiet environment. Neurovascular checks q1h. Maintain strict I/O. Notify provider of any significant changes. Continue to assess pain level and administer pain medication as prescribed. 07:15 MD notified. Orders received and implemented. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Phentolamine IV bolus administered."

    "opt3": "Incorrect: A serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L is within the normal range and does not require immediate intervention in the context of a pheochromocytoma crisis.",
