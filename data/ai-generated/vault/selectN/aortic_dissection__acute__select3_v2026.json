Pain started abruptly 30 min ago. 07:10 A: Pt is restless, anxious, diaphoretic. Reports pain 10/10. BP 190/110 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 94% on RA. Unequal BP in arms noted. 07:15 R: STAT CT angiogram ordered. Anticipate need for BP control. Possible aortic dissection. Notify cardiac surgery team. Monitor VS q5 min. Administer pain meds as ordered. Patient education regarding condition and treatment plan required. Family at bedside, anxious for updates. Continue to assess neurological status. 07:20 S: Patient denies prior episodes. No recent trauma. Taking medications for HTN and cholesterol but not consistently. States he felt a 'tearing' sensation in his chest. 07:25 B: Father died of 'heart attack' at age 70. Mother has HTN. 07:30 A: ECG shows sinus tachycardia, no ST elevation. Continuous cardiac monitoring initiated. Peripheral pulses palpable, but weaker in left arm. 07:35 R: Prepare for potential transfer to OR. Keep NPO. Monitor urine output. Provide emotional support. Update family regularly. Patient is asking for more information about what is happening. 07:40 S: Patient states pain is radiating to his back. 07:45 B: No known allergies. 07:50 A: Current medications: Lisinopril 20mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily (pt reports inconsistent adherence). 07:55 R: Continue to monitor and manage pain. Anticipate orders for IV antihypertensives. Prepare for potential complications."

    "opt1": "CORRECT: Sudden, severe chest pain is a hallmark symptom of aortic dissection and requires immediate intervention to manage pain and prevent further complications.",
    "opt2": "INCORRECT: Aortic dissection typically presents with sudden, not gradual, onset of severe pain. This finding would not require immediate intervention in the context of aortic dissection.",
    "opt3": "CORRECT: A difference in blood pressure between arms is a key indicator of aortic dissection due to involvement of the subclavian artery. This requires immediate intervention to stabilize blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage.",
    "opt4": "INCORRECT: Diminished or absent pulses are more commonly associated with aortic dissection due to arterial blockage. Bounding pulses are not typically associated with this condition.",
    "opt5": "CORRECT: A new aortic regurgitation murmur can occur due to dissection extending into the aortic valve annulus. This requires immediate intervention as it indicates significant cardiac compromise.",
    "opt6": "INCORRECT: Absence of fever is a non-specific finding and does not directly relate to aortic dissection or require immediate intervention.",
    "opt7": "INCORRECT: Widened mediastinum on chest X-ray supports the diagnosis, but is not as time-sensitive as immediate assessment and management of pain, blood pressure discrepancies, and new murmurs. While important, it does not require the MOST immediate intervention.",
