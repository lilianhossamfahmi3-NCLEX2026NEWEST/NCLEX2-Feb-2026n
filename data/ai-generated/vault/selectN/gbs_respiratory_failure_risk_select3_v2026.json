  "rationale": {
    "option_1": "Correct. A decreased tidal volume (300 mL) indicates weakening respiratory muscles and an inability to move adequate air, signaling impending respiratory failure. Normal tidal volume is 6-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight.",
    "option_2": "Incorrect. While an oxygen saturation of 94% is acceptable on 2L nasal cannula, it doesn't negate the need for intervention if other signs of respiratory compromise are present. This indicates compensated respiratory distress, not yet respiratory failure. Further assessment and intervention are needed to prevent deterioration.",
    "option_3": "Correct. Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and further respiratory compromise. Immediate intervention is needed to protect the airway and prevent aspiration.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 92 bpm is within normal limits and does not directly indicate respiratory failure. While tachycardia can be a sign of respiratory distress, the client's heart rate is currently stable.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. Rapidly ascending paralysis is a characteristic of GBS, but in isolation, it does not require immediate intervention *specifically due to respiratory failure risk*. The paralysis contributes to respiratory muscle weakness, but the *manifestations* of that paralysis on airway/breathing (e.g., decreased tidal volume, weak cough) are the critical cues requiring immediate intervention.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. A blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg is slightly elevated but not immediately life-threatening in this context. Focus should be on the respiratory compromise.",
    "option_7": "Correct. A weak cough effort indicates an inability to clear secretions, increasing the risk of airway obstruction and pneumonia. This requires immediate intervention to assist with secretion clearance and prevent respiratory complications.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale: The client with GBS is at high risk for respiratory failure due to ascending paralysis affecting respiratory muscles and bulbar function. Decreased tidal volume, difficulty swallowing, and a weak cough are key indicators of impending respiratory failure and require immediate intervention to support ventilation, protect the airway, and prevent complications."
