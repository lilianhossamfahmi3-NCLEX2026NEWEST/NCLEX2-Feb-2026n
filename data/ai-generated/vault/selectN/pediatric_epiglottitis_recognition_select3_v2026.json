Initial symptoms included sore throat and fever (39.1°C). Patient now exhibiting increased work of breathing, drooling, and anxiety. No known allergies. Immunizations are up to date. 10:05, Vitals: HR 140, RR 40, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 39.3°C. 10:10, Assessment: Patient appears anxious and is sitting upright, leaning forward. Audible stridor present. Drooling noted. Unable to visualize pharynx due to patient distress. 10:15, Recommendation: Suspect epiglottitis. Request immediate ENT consult and preparation for potential intubation. Avoid agitating patient further. Transfer to ICU if airway compromise worsens. Keep NPO. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is critical."

These findings indicate significant airway compromise and the need for immediate intervention to secure the airway and prevent respiratory arrest.
