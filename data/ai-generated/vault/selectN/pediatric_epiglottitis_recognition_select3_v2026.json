Initial symptoms included sore throat and fever (39.1°C). Patient now exhibiting increased work of breathing, drooling, and anxiety. No known allergies. Immunizations are up to date. 10:05, Vitals: HR 140, RR 40, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 39.3°C. 10:10, Assessment: Patient appears anxious and is sitting upright, leaning forward. Audible stridor present. Drooling noted. Unable to visualize pharynx due to patient distress. 10:15, Recommendation: Suspect epiglottitis. Request immediate ENT consult and preparation for potential intubation. Avoid agitating patient further. Transfer to ICU if airway compromise worsens. Keep NPO. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is critical."

    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Hypertension is not a typical finding in epiglottitis. Hypotension might occur later due to respiratory failure and shock, but hypertension is not a primary indicator.",
    "option_4": "CORRECT: Tripod positioning (leaning forward, supporting oneself with arms) is a compensatory mechanism to maximize airway diameter in respiratory distress.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: Bradycardia is an ominous sign and typically a late finding, suggesting severe hypoxia and impending respiratory arrest. Tachycardia is more common initially.",

    "option_7": "INCORRECT: Stridor is a key sign of epiglottitis, BUT is not present as an option. Therefore, the next best correct options must be chosen based on the data given. Although stridor is a high priority finding, it is not included in the correct answer set.",
