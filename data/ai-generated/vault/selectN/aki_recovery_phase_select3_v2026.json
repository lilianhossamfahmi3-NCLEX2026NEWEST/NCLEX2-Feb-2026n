He received IV fluids and was monitored closely. Over the past 24 hours, urine output has gradually increased. Creatinine and BUN levels are trending downward but remain elevated. Electrolytes are within normal limits. He is alert and oriented. No complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath. Vitals stable. Encourage oral fluids and monitor I&O. Contact provider if urine output decreases significantly or creatinine increases. 07:15 Update: Patient reports mild nausea. Administered PRN ondansetron 4mg IV. 07:30 Noted increased urine output to 75 mL/hr. Continue to monitor. 08:00 Patient resting comfortably. Continue current plan. 08:30 Patient denies nausea. Tolerating oral fluids well. 09:00 Urine output 80 mL/hr. Labs pending. 09:30 Patient reports feeling better. Denies any new complaints."
