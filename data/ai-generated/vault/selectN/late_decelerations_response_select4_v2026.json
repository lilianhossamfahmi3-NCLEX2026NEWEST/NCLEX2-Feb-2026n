Started on Pitocin at 2 mU/min at 08:00, currently at 16 mU/min. Membranes ruptured spontaneously at 09:30 with clear fluid. Assessment: Currently 4 cm dilated, 80% effaced, and -2 station. Maternal vital signs are stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 98.8°F. Fetal heart rate baseline is 130 bpm with moderate variability. Late decelerations noted starting at 10:15, coinciding with contractions. Pain level is reported as 7/10. Recommendation: Requesting orders for intrauterine resuscitation measures and evaluation by the provider. Consider decreasing or discontinuing Pitocin. Continuous fetal monitoring in place. Last dose of pain medication (IV fentanyl) was at 09:00. Patient denies any allergies. 10:30"

        "option_1": "Correct: Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 10 L/min increases the oxygen available to the fetus, which can help improve fetal oxygenation during late decelerations.",
        "option_2": "Correct: Increasing the rate of the maintenance IV fluid infusion can improve maternal blood volume and placental perfusion, which can help address the underlying cause of late decelerations.",
        "option_3": "Incorrect: Placing the client in a supine position can compress the vena cava, reducing blood flow to the uterus and potentially worsening late decelerations. The client should be placed in a lateral position to optimize blood flow.",
        "option_4": "Correct: Discontinuing oxytocin, if being administered, reduces uterine contractions, which can decrease fetal stress and improve fetal oxygenation during late decelerations. Oxytocin-induced tachysystole can cause late decelerations.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect: Preparing for immediate delivery may be necessary if other interventions are ineffective, but it is not the first action. Intrauterine resuscitation should be attempted first to improve fetal status.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect: Notifying the healthcare provider is important and should be done concurrently, but it is not the immediate first action. Intrauterine resuscitation should be initiated while simultaneously notifying the provider.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect: While documentation and monitoring are important, they are not the priority actions when late decelerations are present. Immediate interventions are needed to improve fetal oxygenation and address the underlying cause.",

        "correct": "Clinical rationale: Late decelerations indicate uteroplacental insufficiency. The priority is to improve fetal oxygenation through intrauterine resuscitation measures: administering oxygen, increasing IV fluids, discontinuing oxytocin (if applicable), and repositioning the mother to a lateral position.
