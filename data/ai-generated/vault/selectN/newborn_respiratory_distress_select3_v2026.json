B: Mother is G1P1, GBS positive, received antibiotics during labor. Amniotic fluid was clear. Infant initially cried well. A: Noted increased work of breathing. R: Request evaluation for respiratory distress and orders for possible interventions. 20:05. Noted nasal flaring, grunting, and intercostal retractions. Color is pink centrally, but circumoral cyanosis is present. Auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, but respiratory effort is increased. 20:10. Vital signs: HR 160, RR 64, SpO2 92% on room air. Temperature 36.8°C axillary. 20:15. Mother resting comfortably, vital signs stable. Lactation consultant notified for breastfeeding support. 20:20. Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Consider oxygen supplementation if SpO2 drops below 90%. 20:25. Notify provider of any significant changes. Continue routine newborn care. 20:30. Documented findings and interventions in EHR. Will reassess in 30 minutes. Provider notified at 20:35. Orders received and implemented. 20:40. Oxygen per nasal cannula initiated at 1 L/min. SpO2 now 96%. 20:45. Continue to monitor closely and document."

    "option_3": "Correct. Grunting is a sign of respiratory distress, caused by the newborn trying to keep alveoli open.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. A respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min can be normal for a newborn. Normal range is 30-60 breaths/min.",
    "option_5": "Correct. Intercostal retractions indicate increased work of breathing as the newborn uses accessory muscles to breathe.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. Regular bowel sounds are a normal finding and unrelated to respiratory distress.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 140 bpm is within the normal range for a newborn (110-160 bpm)."
