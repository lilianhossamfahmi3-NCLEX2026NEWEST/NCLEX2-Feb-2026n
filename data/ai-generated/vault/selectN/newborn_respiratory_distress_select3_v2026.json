B: Mother is G1P1, GBS positive, received antibiotics during labor. Amniotic fluid was clear. Infant initially cried well. A: Noted increased work of breathing. R: Request evaluation for respiratory distress and orders for possible interventions. 20:05. Noted nasal flaring, grunting, and intercostal retractions. Color is pink centrally, but circumoral cyanosis is present. Auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, but respiratory effort is increased. 20:10. Vital signs: HR 160, RR 64, SpO2 92% on room air. Temperature 36.8°C axillary. 20:15. Mother resting comfortably, vital signs stable. Lactation consultant notified for breastfeeding support. 20:20. Continue to monitor respiratory status closely. Consider oxygen supplementation if SpO2 drops below 90%. 20:25. Notify provider of any significant changes. Continue routine newborn care. 20:30. Documented findings and interventions in EHR. Will reassess in 30 minutes. Provider notified at 20:35. Orders received and implemented. 20:40. Oxygen per nasal cannula initiated at 1 L/min. SpO2 now 96%. 20:45. Continue to monitor closely and document."

It does not typically require immediate intervention unless accompanied by central cyanosis or other signs of respiratory distress.",
        "option_3": "Correct. Grunting is an audible expiratory sound that indicates the newborn is trying to maintain alveolar expansion and prevent collapse. It is a significant sign of respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention.",
        "option_4": "Incorrect. A respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min is within the normal range (30-60 breaths/min) for a newborn. While the newborn's respiratory rate should be monitored, it does not require immediate intervention in isolation.",
        "option_5": "Correct. Intercostal retractions occur when the muscles between the ribs are pulled inward during inspiration, indicating increased effort to breathe. This is a sign of respiratory distress that requires immediate intervention.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect. Regular bowel sounds are a normal finding and are not related to respiratory distress.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 140 bpm is within the normal range (110-160 bpm) for a newborn and does not require immediate intervention.",
        "correct": "The newborn exhibits signs of respiratory distress, including nasal flaring, grunting, and intercostal retractions. These findings indicate increased work of breathing and require immediate intervention to support the newborn's respiratory function. Acrocyanosis, normal heart rate, respiratory rate within normal limits, and regular bowel sounds do not require immediate intervention in this context.",
