BACKGROUND: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, otherwise healthy. Heparin was initiated per protocol for DVT. No known allergies. ASSESSMENT: Patient reports new onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at 07:30. Noted new petechiae on chest and abdomen during morning assessment at 08:00. Vitals: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. Labs from 06:00: Platelets 150,000/μL. New lab order at 08:15. Orders for stat chest CT. RECOMMENDATION: STAT evaluation for possible pulmonary embolism and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consider stopping heparin and initiating alternative anticoagulation. Notify hematology consult. Monitor platelet counts closely. Anticipate potential need for argatroban or other direct thrombin inhibitor. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status. 08:30 RN Smith"

    "opt_2": "CORRECT: Petechiae are small, pinpoint hemorrhages that can indicate thrombocytopenia and impaired clotting function, suggesting a bleeding risk associated with HIT.",
    "opt_3": "INCORRECT: In HIT, the aPTT is typically prolonged or normal, but it may shorten as the prothrombotic state develops. PT is not as directly affected in HIT.",
    "opt_4": "CORRECT: Despite the name, HIT is a prothrombotic condition. The development of a new thrombus, such as in the femoral vein, is a serious complication of HIT.",
    "opt_5": "INCORRECT: While headache and blurred vision can be symptoms of various conditions, they are not specific indicators of HIT. Other causes should be investigated.",
    "opt_6": "INCORRECT: Presence of D-dimer indicates a clot is present somewhere in the body, but is not specific to HIT.",
