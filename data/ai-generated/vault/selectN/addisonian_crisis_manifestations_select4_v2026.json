Background: He usually takes hydrocortisone 20mg PO every morning and 10mg PO every evening. He missed his morning dose today due to the procedure prep. Assessment: The patient is complaining of weakness, dizziness, and abdominal pain. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 110 bpm, and temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C). Recommendation: I am concerned about a possible Addisonian crisis given his missed medication and current symptoms. I recommend stat labs, including serum electrolytes and glucose, and immediate administration of IV fluids and hydrocortisone per protocol. Please evaluate urgently. The colonoscopy was canceled at 06:00 due to patient instability. Patient alert and oriented to person only at 07:15."

        "option_1": "Correct. Hyponatremia (sodium 128 mEq/L) is a common finding in Addisonian crisis due to aldosterone deficiency, leading to increased sodium excretion. This requires immediate intervention to restore fluid and electrolyte balance.",
        "option_2": "Correct. Hypotension (BP 80/50 mm Hg) is a hallmark of Addisonian crisis resulting from decreased cortisol and aldosterone levels, leading to fluid and sodium loss and reduced vascular tone. This requires immediate intervention to improve perfusion.",
        "option_3": "Correct. Hyperkalemia (potassium 6.2 mEq/L) occurs due to aldosterone deficiency, which impairs potassium excretion by the kidneys. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and requires immediate intervention.",
        "option_4": "Incorrect. While tachycardia can occur as a compensatory mechanism for hypotension, it is not as specific to Addisonian crisis as other electrolyte and fluid imbalances. Addressing the underlying hypotension and electrolyte imbalances is the priority.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect. A slightly elevated temperature is not a primary indicator of Addisonian crisis. Fever is not typically associated, and this finding is less critical than the electrolyte and blood pressure abnormalities.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect. While hypoglycemia can occur in Addisonian crisis, a blood glucose of 150 mg/dL is not indicative of this. This value is within a normal range and does not require immediate intervention.",
        "option_7": "Correct. Abdominal pain and nausea are common gastrointestinal symptoms in Addisonian crisis, often related to decreased cortisol levels and resulting stress response. These symptoms contribute to the patient's overall instability and require intervention.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: The patient's presentation, including hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and gastrointestinal distress, strongly suggests Addisonian crisis. These findings require immediate intervention to stabilize the patient's condition and prevent further deterioration. The missed hydrocortisone dose is a significant contributing factor.",
