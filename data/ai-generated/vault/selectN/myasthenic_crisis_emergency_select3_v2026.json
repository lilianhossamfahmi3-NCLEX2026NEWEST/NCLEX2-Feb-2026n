He reports taking his prescribed pyridostigmine, but feels it is no longer effective. 07:05 B: He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis 5 years ago. He has been managed with pyridostigmine. No recent changes in medication. He has had several exacerbations in the past, requiring hospitalization. 07:10 A: Patient is exhibiting signs of a myasthenic crisis. He has significant facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and his oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Respiratory rate is 24 and shallow. He is having difficulty clearing secretions. 07:15 R: I recommend immediate intervention including possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. Stat ABGs and electrolyte panel. Hold pyridostigmine. Consider plasmapheresis or IVIG. Prepare for transfer to ICU."

    "option_1": "Incorrect: Increased hand grip strength is not consistent with myasthenic crisis, which is characterized by muscle weakness. The patient's physical exam notes decreased hand grip strength.",
    "option_2": "Correct: Facial muscle weakness is a key sign of myasthenic crisis, indicating worsening muscle fatigue and potential respiratory compromise. The SBAR and physical exam both highlight significant facial weakness.",
    "option_3": "Incorrect: While elevated, a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is not the most critical finding in the context of a myasthenic crisis where airway and breathing are the priority. The vitals tab shows this reading.",
    "option_4": "Correct: Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) indicates bulbar muscle weakness, increasing the risk of aspiration and respiratory complications. This is noted in the SBAR and physical exam.",
    "option_5": "Correct: An oxygen saturation of 88% on room air indicates hypoxemia and respiratory insufficiency, requiring immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation. This is noted in the SBAR and vitals.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect: Bowel sounds being present in all quadrants is a normal finding and not indicative of myasthenic crisis. This information is not present in the provided tabs.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect: A diminished cough reflex increases the risk for aspiration and ineffective airway clearance, but is less immediately life-threatening than the other correct options. The physical exam notes a weak cough reflex.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale: Myasthenic crisis is a medical emergency characterized by severe muscle weakness, leading to respiratory failure. The priority findings are those that directly impact airway, breathing, and swallowing function. Facial muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, and low oxygen saturation all indicate a compromised airway and respiratory status, requiring immediate intervention."
