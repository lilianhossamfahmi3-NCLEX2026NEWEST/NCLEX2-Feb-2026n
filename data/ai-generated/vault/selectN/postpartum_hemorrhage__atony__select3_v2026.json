    "option_4": "While severe perineal pain should be addressed, it is not the most immediate concern in the context of potential postpartum hemorrhage. Pain could be related to episiotomy or lacerations, but the bleeding is the priority.",
    "option_5": "A heart rate of 120 bpm is elevated and could be a compensatory mechanism for blood loss. This indicates hypovolemia and the need for intervention.",
    "option_6": "A blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg is hypotensive and suggests significant blood loss, requiring immediate intervention to stabilize the patient.",
