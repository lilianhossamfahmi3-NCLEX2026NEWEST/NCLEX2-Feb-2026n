        "option_4": "Incorrect. While severe perineal pain should be addressed, it is not the MOST immediate concern in the context of potential postpartum hemorrhage. Pain could be related to episiotomy or lacerations, but the bleeding is the priority.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 120 bpm is elevated and could be a compensatory mechanism for blood loss. While concerning, it is not as immediately critical as the boggy uterus, saturated pad, and low blood pressure.",
        "option_6": "Correct. A blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg is hypotensive and suggests significant blood loss, requiring immediate intervention to stabilize the patient.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect. Scant lochia rubra is a normal finding in the later postpartum period (days 3-4) and does not indicate postpartum hemorrhage in the immediate postpartum period (first 24 hours).",
