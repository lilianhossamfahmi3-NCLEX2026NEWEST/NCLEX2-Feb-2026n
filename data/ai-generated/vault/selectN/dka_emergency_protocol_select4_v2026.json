Background: Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, but reports non-compliance with insulin regimen for the past month. She presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Assessment: Patient is lethargic and confused. Vitals: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 (Kussmaul respirations), Temp 36.7°C (98.0°F), SpO2 96% on room air. Glucose 580 mg/dL. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but tender to palpation. Capillary refill is delayed. 18:00: Noted fruity odor to breath. 18:05: Alerted charge nurse to patient's condition. 18:10: Started IV access. 18:15: Labs drawn. 18:20: Awaiting provider orders. Recommendation: Patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation, insulin administration, and electrolyte management to correct DKA. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and blood glucose is essential. Consider arterial blood gas to assess acid-base balance. Patient education regarding insulin adherence is crucial upon stabilization."

    "opt_2": "Correct: Once blood glucose reaches 250 mg/dL, adding dextrose to the IV fluids prevents hypoglycemia during insulin administration.",
    "opt_3": "Correct: Potassium replacement is crucial because insulin administration shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially causing life-threatening hypokalemia.",
    "opt_4": "Incorrect: An IV bolus of regular insulin is not the initial treatment. A continuous infusion is preferred to avoid rapid drops in blood glucose.",
    "opt_5": "Correct: A continuous regular insulin infusion is the standard for gradually correcting hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis in DKA.",
    "opt_6": "Incorrect: Sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended unless the pH is less than 7.0 because of the risk of rebound alkalosis and other complications.",
    "opt_7": "Incorrect: Blood glucose should be monitored hourly (or even more frequently) during the acute phase of DKA management."
