Background: Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, but reports non-compliance with insulin regimen for the past month. She presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Assessment: Patient is lethargic and confused. Vitals: HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 32 (Kussmaul respirations), Temp 36.7°C (98.0°F), SpO2 96% on room air. Glucose 580 mg/dL. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but tender to palpation. Capillary refill is delayed. 18:00: Noted fruity odor to breath. 18:05: Alerted charge nurse to patient's condition. 18:10: Started IV access. 18:15: Labs drawn. 18:20: Awaiting provider orders. Recommendation: Patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation, insulin administration, and electrolyte management to correct DKA. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and blood glucose is essential. Consider arterial blood gas to assess acid-base balance. Patient education regarding insulin adherence is crucial upon stabilization."

        "opt_3": "Correct: Potassium replacement is essential because insulin administration shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially leading to life-threatening hypokalemia. The patient's potassium is already low at 3.0 mEq/L.",
        "opt_4": "Incorrect: While insulin is necessary, a continuous infusion is preferred over an IV bolus to avoid rapid drops in blood glucose and prevent complications like cerebral edema.",
        "opt_5": "Correct: A continuous regular insulin infusion is the standard for gradually correcting hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis in DKA.",
        "opt_6": "Incorrect: Sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended unless the pH is less than 7.0 due to the risk of rebound alkalosis and other complications. The patient's pH is 7.25.",
        "opt_7": "Incorrect: While frequent monitoring is important, blood glucose should be monitored at least every hour, or even more frequently, during the acute phase of DKA management to assess the response to treatment and adjust insulin and fluid administration accordingly.",
        "correct": "The correct options address the immediate priorities in DKA management: fluid resuscitation, insulin administration, and electrolyte correction, specifically potassium replacement.
