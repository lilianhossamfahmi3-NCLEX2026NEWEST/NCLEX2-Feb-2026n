  "answerBreakdown": {
    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Eating small, frequent meals (5-6 per day) helps manage dyspnea and conserve energy in COPD. COPD leads to chronic air trapping and hyperinflation, flattening the diaphragm. Large meals cause gastric distention, further compressing the diaphragm and increasing the work of breathing, potentially leading to dyspnea. Small, frequent meals minimize this effect, promoting easier breathing and better nutritional intake.",
      "rationale": "In COPD, the diaphragm's effectiveness is reduced due to hyperinflation. Gastric distention from large meals exacerbates this, increasing the work of breathing. Small, frequent meals prevent excessive gastric pressure, easing breathing and conserving energy.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Advise clients to avoid overeating at any one time. Focus on consistent, smaller portions throughout the day to maintain energy levels and minimize respiratory distress."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Drinking large amounts of fluid with meals can cause gastric distention, which puts pressure on the diaphragm and increases the work of breathing. While hydration is important for thinning secretions, it should be done between meals.",
      "rationale": "Large fluid intake with meals leads to gastric distention, compressing the diaphragm and hindering its movement. This increases the effort required for breathing and can lead to discomfort and reduced food intake.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Emphasize the importance of hydration but instruct clients to drink fluids between meals to avoid exacerbating dyspnea."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. COPD increases metabolic energy demands due to the increased work of breathing. Clients are at risk for malnutrition and cachexia. High-calorie, high-protein foods provide the necessary fuel and building blocks to meet these demands and maintain respiratory muscle mass.",
      "rationale": "The increased work of breathing in COPD significantly elevates metabolic needs. A high-calorie diet provides the energy required, while high protein intake supports muscle repair and maintenance, particularly for the diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscles.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Recommend nutrient-dense foods like eggs, meat, nuts, and whole-fat dairy to help meet caloric and protein needs. Consider nutritional supplements if dietary intake is insufficient."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Eating increases oxygen demand and can trigger bronchospasm and dyspnea in COPD. Using a bronchodilator 20-30 minutes before eating helps relax bronchial smooth muscle, dilating airways and reducing airway resistance. This allows the client to tolerate meals with less shortness of breath, conserving energy and improving nutritional intake.",
      "rationale": "The act of eating increases metabolic demand and can induce bronchoconstriction. Pre-meal bronchodilator use opens airways, reducing resistance and the work of breathing during meals.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Instruct clients to consistently use their prescribed short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) before meals to optimize breathing and improve meal tolerance."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Vigorous exercise immediately after meals can lead to competition for blood flow between the digestive system and skeletal muscles, potentially causing hypoxemia and dyspnea in COPD clients.",
      "rationale": "After eating, blood flow is directed to the digestive system. Exercise diverts blood flow to muscles. In COPD, the compromised respiratory system cannot meet both demands, leading to oxygen deprivation and respiratory distress.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Advise clients to avoid strenuous activity for at least 1-2 hours after meals to allow for proper digestion and prevent respiratory compromise."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. A large breakfast can cause gastric distention, compressing the diaphragm and increasing the work of breathing. This can lead to dyspnea and decreased energy. Small, frequent meals are preferred.",
      "rationale": "Large meals, regardless of the time of day, can cause gastric distention and diaphragmatic compression, increasing the work of breathing. This is especially problematic in COPD patients with already compromised respiratory function.",
      "clinicalPearl": "Emphasize the importance of distributing caloric intake evenly throughout the day rather than concentrating it in one large meal."

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "The Fluid Timing Trap",
    "content": "A common NGN trap involves correctly identifying a necessary intervention but misapplying its timing or context. Test-takers know COPD clients need fluids to thin secretions, making the fluid option attractive. However, the critical detail is *when* to drink. Consuming large fluid volumes *with* meals is physiologically detrimental because it causes gastric distention and early satiety, worsening dyspnea and malnutrition. The correct advice is to hydrate *between* meals."

    "title": "COPD Nutrition: 'BREATHE'",
    "content": "A mnemonic for COPD nutritional discharge teaching:\n\n**B** - Bronchodilator before meals\n**R** - Rest before eating\n**E** - Eat small, frequent, high-calorie/protein meals\n**A** - Avoid gas-forming foods (e.g., cabbage, beans) to limit bloating\n**T** - Take time; chew slowly\n**H** - Hydrate between meals, not during\n**E** - Elevate head while eating"
