    "answerBreakdown": {
        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. In COPD, chronic air trapping (hyperinflation) causes the diaphragm to flatten, reducing its efficiency. A large meal causes gastric distention, which physically pushes up on this already compromised diaphragm, further limiting its excursion and decreasing thoracic volume. This directly increases the work of breathing and can precipitate dyspnea. Consuming 5-6 small meals minimizes gastric pressure on the diaphragm, conserving energy and preventing meal-related shortness of breath."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. While adequate hydration (approx. 2-3 L/day) is essential for thinning tenacious respiratory secretions, consuming large volumes of fluid *with* meals is contraindicated. This practice causes rapid gastric distention, leading to diaphragmatic compression and dyspnea. It also promotes early satiety, preventing the client from consuming sufficient calories and protein. Fluids should be encouraged between meals, not during them."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. The work of breathing in severe COPD can increase metabolic energy demands by up to 10-fold compared to a healthy individual. This hypermetabolic state, combined with dyspnea-related anorexia, places the client at high risk for malnutrition and cachexia, specifically wasting of respiratory muscles. A diet high in calories provides the necessary fuel to meet this demand, while high protein content is crucial for maintaining and repairing the diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle mass, improving overall respiratory function."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. The act of eating itself is a form of exercise that increases oxygen demand. In COPD, this can trigger bronchospasm and dyspnea. Administering a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) 20-30 minutes before a meal pre-emptively relaxes bronchial smooth muscle and dilates the airways. This reduces airway resistance and the work of breathing, allowing the client to tolerate the meal with less shortness of breath, conserve energy, and improve nutritional intake."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. After eating, blood flow is physiologically shunted to the gastrointestinal system to facilitate digestion and absorption (digestive hyperemia). Vigorous exercise creates a competing demand for oxygenated blood in the large skeletal muscles. In a client with impaired gas exchange from COPD, the cardiopulmonary system cannot meet both demands simultaneously. This competition for a limited oxygen supply can induce severe hypoxemia, acute dyspnea, and potentially myocardial ischemia."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This instruction directly contradicts the primary principle of avoiding gastric distention. A large meal at any time, including breakfast, will compress the diaphragm and increase the work of breathing. Many clients with COPD experience their worst dyspnea in the morning due to pooled secretions overnight. Attempting to eat a large meal during this period would be particularly exhausting and could lead to aspiration or a refusal to eat for the rest of the day."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "The Fluid Timing Trap",
        "content": "A common NGN trap involves correctly identifying a necessary intervention but misapplying its timing or context. Test-takers know COPD clients need fluids to thin secretions, making the fluid option attractive. However, the critical detail is *when* to drink. Consuming large fluid volumes *with* meals is physiologically detrimental because it causes gastric distention and early satiety, worsening dyspnea and malnutrition. The correct advice is to hydrate *between* meals."
