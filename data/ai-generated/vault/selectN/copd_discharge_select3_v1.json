Test-takers know COPD clients need fluids to thin secretions, making the fluid option attractive. However, the critical detail is *when* to drink. Consuming large fluid volumes *with* meals is physiologically detrimental because it causes gastric distention and early satiety, worsening dyspnea and malnutrition. The correct advice is to hydrate *between* meals."

                "content": "Correct. Eating small, frequent meals (5-6 per day) helps manage dyspnea and conserve energy in clients with COPD. COPD leads to chronic air trapping and hyperinflation, flattening the diaphragm. Large meals cause gastric distention, further compressing the diaphragm and increasing the work of breathing, potentially leading to dyspnea. Small, frequent meals minimize this effect, promoting easier breathing and better nutritional intake."

Using a prescribed bronchodilator 20-30 minutes before eating helps relax bronchial smooth muscle, dilating airways and reducing airway resistance. This allows the client to tolerate meals with less shortness of breath, conserving energy and improving nutritional intake."

The client's oxygen saturation has stabilized on room air.\nAssessment: The client demonstrates understanding of their medication regimen but requires further education on nutrition and energy conservation strategies to manage symptoms at home.\nRecommendation: Provide clear instructions on eating small, frequent meals, choosing high-calorie, high-protein foods, using a prescribed bronchodilator 30 minutes before meals, and avoiding large fluid intake with meals. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a registered dietitian for further support and education."
