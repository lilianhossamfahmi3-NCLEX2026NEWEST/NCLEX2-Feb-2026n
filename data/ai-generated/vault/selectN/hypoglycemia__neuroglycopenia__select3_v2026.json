He is currently on IV antibiotics and scheduled for discharge in two days. \n\n07:00, Situation: Mr. Jones is now exhibiting altered mental status and appears confused. \n\n07:01, Background: He has been managing his diabetes with oral medication, Metformin 500mg twice daily, prior to admission. His appetite has been poor since admission. \n\n07:02, Assessment: Patient is diaphoretic and has slurred speech. Initial vital signs this morning were stable, but I noticed a change in his mentation about 30 minutes ago. Current blood glucose via fingerstick is 60 mg/dL. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. \n\n07:03, Recommendation: I recommend checking his blood glucose stat and notifying the provider for further orders. He may need IV dextrose to correct his hypoglycemia. I am also concerned about neuroglycopenic symptoms given his altered mental status. Requesting orders for frequent glucose monitoring and possible adjustment of his diabetic medications."

    "opt_3": "CORRECT: Slurred speech can indicate neuroglycopenia, which is a neurological manifestation of hypoglycemia due to insufficient glucose supply to the brain.",
