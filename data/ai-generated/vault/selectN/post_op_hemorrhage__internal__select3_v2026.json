    "optA": "Correct: Restlessness and anxiety are early signs of hypovolemia due to blood loss, as the body attempts to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery.",

    "optC": "Incorrect: A urine output of 40 mL/hr is within the normal range and does not necessarily indicate internal hemorrhage. Normal urine output is generally considered to be >30 mL/hr.",
    "optD": "Incorrect: Abdominal distension can be associated with hemorrhage but can also be caused by other post-operative factors such as gas or ileus. While it should be monitored, it's not as direct an indicator as other options.",
    "optE": "Incorrect: Serosanguinous drainage is expected and normal in the initial post-operative period. However, it is important to monitor the amount and character of drainage.",
    "optF": "Incorrect: Incisional pain is an expected finding after surgery. While pain should be managed, it is not indicative of internal hemorrhage.",
    "optG": "Correct: Decreasing hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are direct indicators of blood loss and strongly suggest internal hemorrhage."

Serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are essential to detect occult bleeding. Be aware that abdominal distension and pain can also be present, but may not be specific to hemorrhage alone.",
