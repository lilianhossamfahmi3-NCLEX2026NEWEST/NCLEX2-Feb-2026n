Creatinine increasing, now 3.5 mg/dL. Potassium 6.8 mEq/L this morning. Medications include lisinopril and furosemide. No known allergies. Baseline ECG unremarkable.\nAssessment: Alert and oriented. Complaining of muscle weakness. Telemetry monitoring in place. Current ECG shows tall, peaked T waves. Urine output minimal in the last 4 hours. Bowel sounds present. No edema noted.\nRecommendation: Continuous cardiac monitoring. Repeat potassium level. Administer prescribed kayexalate and insulin/dextrose. Consider sodium bicarbonate if ECG changes worsen. Assess for dialysis needs. Frequent neurovascular checks."
