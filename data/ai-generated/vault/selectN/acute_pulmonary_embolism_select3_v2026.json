    "option_1": "CORRECT: Sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain is a classic symptom of pulmonary embolism, caused by the obstruction of pulmonary vessels and subsequent lung tissue ischemia. This requires immediate attention to assess for PE and initiate appropriate treatment.",
    "option_2": "INCORRECT: An oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, while below the optimal range, is not immediately life-threatening. However, it warrants close monitoring and potential oxygen supplementation, but other findings are more indicative of the need for immediate provider notification.",
    "option_3": "CORRECT: A heart rate of 120 bpm and regular indicates tachycardia, which can be a compensatory mechanism in response to hypoxemia and decreased cardiac output caused by the pulmonary embolism. This warrants immediate attention to assess the underlying cause and provide appropriate interventions.",
    "option_4": "INCORRECT: A blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg is within normal limits and does not indicate immediate hemodynamic instability requiring immediate notification. However, trends in blood pressure should be monitored.",
    "option_5": "CORRECT: New onset cough with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is a concerning sign of pulmonary embolism, suggesting pulmonary infarction and alveolar hemorrhage. This requires immediate intervention to assess the extent of the PE and prevent further complications.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Anxiety and restlessness are common in patients with PE, but are not the most critical findings requiring immediate provider notification. Addressing the underlying cause of hypoxemia and providing reassurance are important, but other findings take priority.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: A temperature of 37.2°C (99.0°F) is slightly elevated but not a critical finding in the context of a suspected pulmonary embolism. Other signs and symptoms are more indicative of the acute process.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
