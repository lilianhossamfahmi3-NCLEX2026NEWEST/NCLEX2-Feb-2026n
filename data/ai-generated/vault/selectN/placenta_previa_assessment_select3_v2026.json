She denies any abdominal pain or contractions. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated, resulting in a term vaginal delivery.\nAssessment: Vital signs are: HR 110, BP 90/60, RR 20, SpO2 98% on room air. Fetal heart rate initially 140 bpm but now trending 100 bpm. Moderate vaginal bleeding observed. Uterus is soft and non-tender. Fundal height is 34 cm.\nRecommendation: Continuous fetal monitoring, assess blood loss, anticipate potential need for blood transfusion. Strict pelvic rest. Consult with OB/GYN immediately. Consider stat ultrasound to confirm placental location. Monitor maternal vital signs closely q15 minutes. Prepare for possible emergent C-section if fetal or maternal status deteriorates. Keep NPO. Ensure large bore IV access is patent. Provide emotional support to the patient and her partner. Notify lab to type and screen for blood products. Obtain complete blood count (CBC). Assess for signs of hypovolemic shock. Repeat vital signs in 15 minutes. 03:20: Call attending physician for orders."
