Noted periorbital ecchymosis and clear nasal drainage. Vitals: HR 92, BP 140/90, RR 22, SpO2 95% on room air. A: Possible basilar skull fracture. Risk for increased ICP. Plan: Continuous neuro monitoring. 07:15 Noted ecchymosis behind the ears. 07:30 Dr. Smith notified. Fluid from nose tested positive for halo sign. Patient is being prepared for CT scan. Maintain airway and monitor neuro status closely. Family at bedside. Fall occurred approximately 3 hours prior to arrival. Daughter reports patient has been complaining of headaches for the past week. No loss of consciousness reported by daughter. Patient is oriented to person only. Allergies: NKDA. PMH: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia. Medications: Lisinopril, Atorvastatin. 07:45 Patient reports a severe headache. Rates pain 8/10."

    "option_1": "Correct. Periorbital ecchymosis, also known as raccoon eyes, is a classic sign of a basilar skull fracture due to blood tracking into the soft tissues around the eyes.",
    "option_2": "Incorrect. Clear fluid drainage from the nose (rhinorrhea) can indicate a CSF leak, which is concerning but needs confirmation via halo sign or lab analysis.",
    "option_3": "Incorrect. A heart rate of 88 bpm is within the normal range and does not specifically indicate a complication of a basilar skull fracture.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg is within the normal range and does not specifically indicate a complication of a basilar skull fracture. While hypertension can worsen ICP, this value isn't immediately alarming.",
    "option_5": "Correct. Battle's sign, or mastoid ecchymosis, is another key indicator of a basilar skull fracture. It results from blood tracking along the posterior auricular artery.",
    "option_6": "Correct. A halo sign, where a ring of CSF separates from blood on filter paper, strongly suggests a CSF leak, a significant complication of a basilar skull fracture that increases the risk of meningitis.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. Pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERRLA) are a normal finding and do not indicate a complication of a basilar skull fracture. However, continued monitoring is essential."

  "clinicalPearls": "Basilar skull fractures are often diagnosed based on clinical signs like raccoon eyes and Battle's sign. Confirmation typically involves imaging and CSF analysis. CSF leaks increase the risk of meningitis.",
  "questionTrap": "Be careful to distinguish between signs that are merely concerning and those that are highly indicative of a basilar skull fracture and its complications. Normal vital signs can distract from the more serious neurological findings.",
  "mnemonic": "Think 'BEAR' for Battle's sign, Eyes (raccoon), and Rhinorrhea (CSF leak indication).",
