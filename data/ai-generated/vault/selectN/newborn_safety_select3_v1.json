New parents often want to make the baby 'cozy' with soft toys (D) or keep them 'warm' with a hat (F), but these actions directly contradict evidence-based guidelines for preventing suffocation and SIDS. Another trap is a lack of specific knowledge, such as the exact safe temperature for a water heater (E); 140°F might sound reasonable to someone unfamiliar with the rapid burn potential on an infant's delicate skin. The question tests the ability to prioritize scientifically-backed safety measures over common but dangerous misconceptions."

Prone positioning can lead to pharyngeal compression and rebreathing of exhaled CO2, causing hypercapnia and hypoxia. This blunts the infant's arousal response, preventing them from waking to correct the life-threatening situation. ClinicalPearl: Reinforce that 'Back to Sleep' is the safest position, even if the infant spits up; their anatomy prevents aspiration in this position."

Soft surfaces can conform to the infant's face, creating an occlusive seal and trapping exhaled air, leading to CO2 rebreathing and hypoxia. A firm surface prevents indentation, and a tight sheet prevents loose fabric from obstructing the airway. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize that the crib should be bare except for the fitted sheet. No blankets, pillows, or bumpers."

In a frontal crash, a rear-facing seat distributes impact forces across the seat's shell, protecting the head, neck, and spine. The back seat is the safest location, minimizing injury from side impacts and airbag deployment. ClinicalPearl: Stress that car seat safety is non-negotiable, even for short trips."

Soft objects can obstruct an infant's airway if they roll into them, leading to rebreathing of CO2, hypercapnia, and hypoxia. This depresses the central nervous system and protective arousal reflexes, preventing the infant from repositioning their head. ClinicalPearl: Remind parents that a bare crib is a safe crib."

At this temperature, a full-thickness burn can occur in 3-5 seconds. The recommended maximum temperature is 120°F (49°C), which extends the time to produce a similar burn to over 5 minutes.

While a hat is appropriate immediately post-delivery, wearing one during sleep can prevent heat dissipation, leading to hyperthermia, a SIDS risk factor. A loose hat can also slip over the infant's face, causing airway obstruction. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize that the baby should be dressed appropriately for the room temperature, not bundled up."
