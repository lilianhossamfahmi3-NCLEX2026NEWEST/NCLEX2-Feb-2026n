            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a cornerstone of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) prevention. The supine (back) position maintains a patent airway. In the prone (stomach) position, the infant's pharynx can be compressed, and they are more likely to rebreathe their own exhaled carbon dioxide, which accumulates in the bedding. This leads to progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia, which blunts the infant's arousal response and chemoreceptor sensitivity, preventing them from waking to correct the life-threatening situation."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This instruction directly addresses the risk of mechanical suffocation. A soft sleep surface can conform to the shape of the infant's head and face, creating an occlusive seal over the nose and mouth. This traps exhaled air, leading to CO2 rebreathing and subsequent hypoxia. A firm surface prevents this indentation, while a tight-fitting sheet ensures there is no loose fabric that could bunch up and obstruct the airway or become an entanglement hazard."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "This is a critical vehicle safety measure based on biomechanics. A newborn's head constitutes about 25% of their body weight, and their cervical spine and supporting muscles are underdeveloped. In a frontal crash, a rear-facing seat absorbs the impact forces across the entire shell of the seat, cradling the infant's head, neck, and spine. This prevents the violent forward flexion-extension of the head that would occur in a forward-facing seat, which can cause catastrophic spinal cord injuries. The back seat is the safest location, minimizing injury from side impacts and avoiding the forceful deployment of front passenger airbags."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This action creates a significant suffocation hazard. Soft objects like stuffed animals, pillows, and thick blankets can obstruct an infant's airway if they roll or turn their face into them. This leads to a pocket of trapped expired air, causing rebreathing of carbon dioxide. The resulting hypercapnia and hypoxia depress the central nervous system and the infant's protective arousal reflexes, preventing them from repositioning their head to clear the airway."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This temperature poses a severe scald risk. Newborn skin is thinner and has less subcutaneous fat than adult skin, making it more susceptible to deep thermal injury at lower temperatures and shorter exposure times. At 140°F (60°C), a full-thickness burn can occur in as little as 3-5 seconds. The recommended maximum temperature for a water heater is 120°F (49°C), which extends the time to produce a similar burn to over 5 minutes, providing a critical window for parental intervention."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "This practice introduces two distinct risks: hyperthermia and suffocation. Newborns thermoregulate primarily through their head. While a hat is appropriate immediately post-delivery to prevent heat loss, wearing one during sleep in a temperature-controlled environment can prevent heat dissipation, leading to overheating (hyperthermia), which is a significant risk factor for SIDS. Additionally, a loose-fitting hat can easily slip down over the infant's nose and mouth, causing mechanical airway obstruction and suffocation."

    "questionTrap": {
        "title": "Comfort vs. Evidence-Based Safety",
        "content": "The primary trap is confusing well-intentioned comfort measures with mandatory safety protocols. New parents often want to make the baby 'cozy' with soft toys (D) or keep them 'warm' with a hat (F), but these actions directly contradict evidence-based guidelines for preventing suffocation and SIDS. Another trap is a lack of specific knowledge, such as the exact safe temperature for a water heater (E); 140°F might sound reasonable to someone unfamiliar with the rapid burn potential on an infant's delicate skin. The question tests the ability to prioritize scientifically-backed safety measures over common but dangerous misconceptions."
