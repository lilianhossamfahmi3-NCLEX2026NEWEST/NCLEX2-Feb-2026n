      "correct": true,
      "content": "Placing the newborn on their back to sleep is crucial for SIDS prevention. The supine position ensures a patent airway. Prone positioning can lead to pharyngeal compression and rebreathing of exhaled CO2, causing hypercapnia and hypoxia. This blunts the infant's arousal response, preventing them from waking to correct the life-threatening situation. ClinicalPearl: Reinforce that 'Back to Sleep' is the safest position, even if the infant spits up; their anatomy prevents aspiration in this position.",
      "rationale": "The supine position reduces the risk of SIDS by maintaining a clear airway and preventing rebreathing of carbon dioxide. This allows for adequate oxygenation and reduces the risk of hypoxia, which can impair the infant's arousal response and ability to correct life-threatening situations.",

      "content": "A firm mattress with a tight-fitting sheet minimizes suffocation risk. Soft surfaces can conform to the infant's face, creating an occlusive seal and trapping exhaled air, leading to CO2 rebreathing and hypoxia. A firm surface prevents indentation, and a tight sheet prevents loose fabric from obstructing the airway. ClinicalPearl: Emphasize that the crib should be bare except for the fitted sheet. No blankets, pillows, or bumpers.",

In a frontal crash, a rear-facing seat distributes impact forces across the seat's shell, protecting the head, neck, and spine. The back seat is the safest location, minimizing injury from side impacts and airbag deployment. ClinicalPearl: Stress that car seat safety is non-negotiable, even for short trips.",
      "rationale": "Rear-facing car seats provide optimal protection for infants in the event of a crash by distributing impact forces across the entire seat and supporting the head, neck, and spine.

  "questionTrap": {
    "title": "Comfort vs. Evidence-Based Safety",
    "content": "The primary trap is confusing well-intentioned comfort measures with mandatory safety protocols. New parents often want to make the baby 'cozy' with soft toys (D) or keep them 'warm' with a hat (F), but these actions directly contradict evidence-based guidelines for preventing suffocation and SIDS. Another trap is a lack of specific knowledge, such as the exact safe temperature for a water heater (E); 140°F might sound reasonable to someone unfamiliar with the rapid burn potential on an infant's delicate skin. The question tests the ability to prioritize scientifically-backed safety measures over common but dangerous misconceptions."
