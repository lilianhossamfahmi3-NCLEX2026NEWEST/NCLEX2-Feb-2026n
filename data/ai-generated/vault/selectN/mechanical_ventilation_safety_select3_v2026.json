He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation yesterday at 14:00. Current vent settings: FiO2 50%, TV 450 mL, PEEP 5 cm H2O, RR 16. The patient is currently sedated with propofol. \n\n07:15 - The patient's SpO2 has been fluctuating between 88-92% despite the FiO2 setting. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side. The high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) alarm is sounding frequently. The patient appears restless. \n\n07:30 - I suspect a possible pneumothorax or displaced endotracheal tube. I recommend stat chest X-ray, ABG, and assessment by respiratory therapy. We may need to increase sedation or adjust vent settings. Please come to assess the patient urgently. \n\n07:45 - Upon entering the room, the ventilator tubing was found disconnected from the endotracheal tube. It was immediately reconnected. The high PIP alarm continues to sound intermittently. The patient is coughing."

    "option_1": "Correct. A high PIP alarm indicates increased resistance to airflow, which could be caused by a variety of issues such as secretions, bronchospasm, kinked tubing, or pneumothorax. This requires immediate investigation to identify and correct the underlying cause to prevent barotrauma.",
    "option_2": "Incorrect. An ETCO2 of 38 mmHg is within the normal range (35-45 mmHg), indicating adequate ventilation.",
    "option_3": "Incorrect. An SpO2 of 90% is below the target range for most patients, however, given the ABG results, addressing ventilation is the priority. Also, the SBAR indicates the SpO2 fluctuates between 88-92%, so 90% in isolation is not the most alarming.",
    "option_4": "Correct. Decreased breath sounds on one side could indicate a pneumothorax or endotracheal tube displacement, both of which are life-threatening complications requiring immediate attention. This finding correlates with the SBAR information.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. While adequate sedation is important, simply increasing sedation without addressing the underlying respiratory issues is not the priority. The ABG results indicate a ventilation problem, not necessarily a sedation problem.",
    "option_6": "Correct. Disconnection of the ventilator tubing from the endotracheal tube will immediately compromise ventilation and oxygenation, requiring immediate reconnection to restore gas exchange.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. An ABG pH of 7.30 indicates respiratory acidosis, but it is not the most immediate threat. The disconnected tubing and potential pneumothorax are higher priorities."
