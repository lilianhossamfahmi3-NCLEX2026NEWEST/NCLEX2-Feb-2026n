Sedated with propofol.\n\n**Assessment:** 07:15 - SpO2 fluctuating between 88-92% despite FiO2. Decreased breath sounds on the left. High peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) alarm sounding frequently. Patient appears restless. 07:45 - Ventilator tubing was found disconnected from the endotracheal tube and immediately reconnected. The high PIP alarm continues to sound intermittently. The patient is coughing.\n\n**Recommendation:** Stat chest X-ray, ABG, and respiratory therapy assessment. Consider increasing sedation or adjusting vent settings. Urgent assessment needed."

  "rationale": {
    "option_1": "Correct. A high PIP alarm indicates increased resistance to airflow. This could be due to several factors, including increased secretions, bronchospasm, kinked tubing, or a pneumothorax. The nurse must immediately assess the patient and the ventilator system to identify and correct the cause to prevent potential barotrauma and ensure adequate ventilation.",
    "option_2": "Incorrect. An ETCO2 of 38 mmHg is within the normal range (35-45 mmHg), indicating adequate carbon dioxide removal. While continuous monitoring is important, this value does not require immediate intervention.",
    "option_3": "Incorrect. An SpO2 of 90% is below the desired target range for most patients, but it is not the MOST immediate threat. The ABG results and other clinical findings suggest a ventilation problem that needs to be addressed first. Addressing the underlying cause of the hypoxemia is the priority.",
    "option_4": "Correct. Decreased breath sounds on one side, particularly in a mechanically ventilated patient, could indicate a pneumothorax or endotracheal tube displacement. Both are life-threatening complications that require immediate attention. This finding correlates with the SBAR information and warrants immediate investigation and intervention.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. While adequate sedation is important for patient comfort and to facilitate mechanical ventilation, simply increasing sedation without addressing the underlying respiratory issues is not the priority. The ABG results indicate a ventilation problem, not necessarily a sedation problem. Addressing the ventilation issue will likely improve the patient's comfort and reduce the need for increased sedation.",
    "option_6": "Correct. Disconnection of the ventilator tubing from the endotracheal tube will immediately compromise ventilation and oxygenation, leading to rapid desaturation and potential respiratory arrest. Immediate reconnection is crucial to restore gas exchange and prevent further deterioration.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. An ABG pH of 7.30 indicates respiratory acidosis, which requires intervention. However, the disconnected tubing and potential pneumothorax are more immediate threats to the patient's life. Addressing the ventilation issues will likely improve the pH.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale is complete and aligned with the item context."
