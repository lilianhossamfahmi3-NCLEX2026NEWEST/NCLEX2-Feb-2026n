The correct and safe instruction is to maintain a *consistent* dietary intake of Vitamin K so the warfarin dose can be stably titrated. Any significant, sustained change in diet requires INR monitoring and potential dose adjustment. Another critical trap is underestimating the danger of NSAIDs. Students may know NSAIDs increase bleeding risk but fail to recognize the specific synergistic effect: NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation while warfarin inhibits clotting factors, creating two separate defects in hemostasis that dramatically elevate the risk of severe hemorrhage."

      "a": {
        "correct": true,
        "content": "Correct. Hypotension in cardiac tamponade directly results from a critical reduction in cardiac output. The accumulating pericardial fluid exerts external pressure on the ventricles, severely limiting their ability to expand and fill during diastole (decreased preload). This leads to a diminished stroke volume. As the heart pumps out less blood with each beat, systemic arterial pressure falls, causing hypotension."
      },
      "b": {
        "correct": true,
        "content": "Correct. Jugular Venous Distention (JVD) is a direct consequence of impaired right-sided heart filling. The increased intrapericardial pressure compresses the right atrium and ventricle, impeding the return of deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation via the vena cavae. This creates a 'backlog' of pressure that is transmitted retrograde into the superior vena cava and the jugular veins, causing them to become visibly engorged and indicating a high central venous pressure (CVP)."
      },
      "c": {
        "correct": true,
        "content": "Correct. Muffled, or distant, heart sounds occur because the pericardial fluid acts as an acoustic insulator. The sounds of valvular closure (S1 and S2) are vibrations that must travel through the chest wall to be heard. The layer of fluid between the heart and the pericardial sac dampens these vibrations, making them sound faint and distant upon auscultation with a stethoscope."

      "d": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. The initial compensatory response to the profound drop in cardiac output and blood pressure is a baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) surge. This releases catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), which stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, causing tachycardia (an increased heart rate) in an attempt to maintain cardiac output (CO = SV x HR). Bradycardia would be a late, pre-terminal sign indicating imminent cardiovascular collapse, not a component of Beck's Triad."
      },
      "e": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. While pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg during inspiration) is a classic and important sign of cardiac tamponade, it is not part of the specific triad described by Dr. Claude Beck. The pathophysiology involves the rigid pericardium causing the interventricular septum to bulge into the left ventricle during inspiration (due to increased right-sided venous return), which further reduces left ventricular filling and stroke volume, causing the pressure drop. This is a key distractor."

      "f": {
        "correct": false,
        "content": "Incorrect. Hypertension is the opposite of the expected hemodynamic finding. The fundamental problem in cardiac tamponade is the heart's inability to pump effectively due to external compression. This mechanical failure leads to a sharp decrease in cardiac output and, consequently, severe hypotension. Hypertension would point towards a different underlying pathology."
