      "content": "Correct. Low arterial blood pressure (hypotension) is a core component of Beck's Triad. Pathophysiology: Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac compresses the heart, restricting ventricular diastolic filling. Reduced preload leads to decreased stroke volume. Since Blood Pressure = Cardiac Output (Stroke Volume x Heart Rate) x Systemic Vascular Resistance, decreased stroke volume causes decreased cardiac output and hypotension, resulting in obstructive shock.",
      "rationale": "Hypotension occurs due to decreased cardiac output from impaired ventricular filling.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Monitor blood pressure closely and report any significant drops immediately. Prepare for fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration as prescribed to maintain adequate blood pressure."

      "optionId": "b",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Distended neck veins, or jugular venous distention (JVD), is a key sign in Beck's Triad. Pathophysiology: Pericardial effusion compresses the right atrium and ventricle, impeding venous return. Blood backs up into the central venous system, elevating central venous pressure (CVP), visualized as JVD.",
      "rationale": "JVD results from increased central venous pressure due to impaired right atrial filling.",
      "clinicalPearls": "Assess JVD in a semi-recumbent position (30-45 degrees). Increased JVD indicates worsening cardiac tamponade."

      "isCorrect": true,
      "content": "Correct. Muffled or distant heart sounds are the third component of Beck's Triad. Pathophysiology: Fluid in the pericardial sac acts as an acoustic insulator, dampening sound transmission. Valve closure sounds (S1 and S2) must travel through this fluid, causing them to sound faint, muffled, or distant.",
      "rationale": "Muffled heart sounds occur because the fluid in the pericardial sac dampens the sound transmission.",

      "optionId": "d",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Cardiac tamponade causes a NARROWED pulse pressure, not a wide one. Pathophysiology: Limited stroke volume causes systolic pressure to fall. Compensatory sympathetic nervous system activation triggers peripheral vasoconstriction, keeping diastolic pressure relatively stable or slightly elevated. Falling systolic pressure with stable diastolic pressure narrows the pulse pressure.",
      "rationale": "Cardiac tamponade leads to a narrowed pulse pressure due to a decrease in systolic blood pressure.",

      "content": "Incorrect. Inspiratory wheezing is associated with airway obstruction, not cardiac tamponade. Pathophysiology: Wheezing is generated by turbulent airflow through narrowed airways, typical of conditions like asthma or anaphylaxis. Cardiac tamponade is a hemodynamic crisis caused by mechanical compression of the heart; it does not directly cause airway narrowing.",
      "rationale": "Wheezing is related to airway obstruction, not cardiac tamponade.",

      "optionId": "f",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. The initial compensatory response in cardiac tamponade is tachycardia, not bradycardia. Pathophysiology: Baroreceptors detect decreased cardiac output and blood pressure, triggering sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholamine release. These hormones stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors, increasing heart rate (tachycardia) to compensate for failing stroke volume and maintain cardiac output (CO = SV x HR). Bradycardia is a late, ominous sign indicating complete failure of compensatory mechanisms.",
