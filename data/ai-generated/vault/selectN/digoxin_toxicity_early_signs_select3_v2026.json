    "option_1": "CORRECT: Visual disturbances such as blurred vision and seeing halos around lights are classic early signs of digoxin toxicity due to its effects on the central nervous system and retinal cells.",
    "option_2": "CORRECT: Bradycardia (apical heart rate of 52 bpm) is a significant early indicator of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node, leading to a decreased heart rate. This is especially concerning in a patient already taking digoxin for rate control.",
    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Hypokalemia (serum potassium of 3.0 mEq/L) can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity, but it is not a direct sign of toxicity itself. Hypokalemia increases the binding of digoxin to cardiac cells, exacerbating its effects. The question asks for direct signs of toxicity.",
    "option_4": "CORRECT: Nausea and anorexia are common early gastrointestinal symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin can affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, leading to these symptoms.",
    "option_5": "INCORRECT: Increased urine output is not typically associated with digoxin toxicity. It is more commonly associated with diuretic use, such as furosemide, which the patient is also taking.",
    "option_6": "INCORRECT: Constipation is not a typical finding in digoxin toxicity. Diarrhea is more commonly reported, though GI symptoms are variable. The patient's hypoactive bowel sounds are more likely related to digoxin toxicity or hypokalemia.",
    "option_7": "INCORRECT: While muscle weakness can occur in digoxin toxicity, it's a less specific and often later sign compared to visual changes, bradycardia, and GI symptoms. The patient's muscle weakness could also be related to hypokalemia or other factors."

  "clinicalPearls": "Early signs of digoxin toxicity are often subtle and can be easily missed. Visual disturbances, GI upset, and bradycardia should prompt immediate investigation.

  "questionTrap": "The trap is to select potassium 3.0 mEq/L. While hypokalemia potentiates digoxin toxicity, it is not a direct effect of the drug itself. Focus on direct effects of the drug. Also, muscle weakness is a less specific symptom and can be caused by other factors.",
