    "option_3": "INCORRECT: Hypokalemia (serum potassium of 3.0 mEq/L) can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity, but it is a contributing factor rather than a direct sign of toxicity itself. The question asks for direct signs of toxicity.",

    "option_5": "INCORRECT: Increased urine output is not typically associated with digoxin toxicity. It is more commonly associated with diuretic use.",
