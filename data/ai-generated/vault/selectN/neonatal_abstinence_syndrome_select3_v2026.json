Last dose unknown. Positive urine drug screen at admission. Baby Apgar scores 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes. C: Irritable, jittery, frequent sneezing. RR 60, HR 160, Temp 37.5°C. NAS scoring trending upward. Administered morphine 0.05 mg PO at 06:00. R: Continue to monitor NAS scoring q3h. Consider increasing morphine dose if symptoms worsen. Consult neonatologist if no improvement. Provide supportive care: swaddling, quiet environment. Obtain order for IV fluids if poor feeding continues. Monitor weight and electrolytes. Educate mother on non-pharmacological comfort measures. Document all interventions and observations. Assess for other complications of NAS. Encourage mother-baby bonding as appropriate."

    "option_1": "Correct. A high-pitched cry is a classic sign of NAS due to central nervous system irritability.",

    "option_3": "Correct. Loose stools indicate gastrointestinal distress related to withdrawal and may lead to dehydration.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. Apneic episodes are a serious finding but less common than other symptoms. This requires immediate intervention, but is not one of the three most likely findings.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect. Lethargy is not a typical finding in NAS; these infants are usually irritable.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. Poor feeding is a common symptom but not one that requires immediate intervention.",
    "option_7": "Correct. An exaggerated Moro reflex indicates increased excitability of the nervous system, requiring intervention to prevent injury.",
