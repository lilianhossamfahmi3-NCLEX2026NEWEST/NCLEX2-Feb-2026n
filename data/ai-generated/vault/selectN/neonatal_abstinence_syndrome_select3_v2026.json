NAS scoring trending upward. Administered morphine 0.05 mg PO at 06:00. R: Continue to monitor NAS scoring q3h. Consider increasing morphine dose if symptoms worsen. Consult neonatologist if no improvement. Provide supportive care: swaddling, quiet environment. Obtain order for IV fluids if poor feeding continues. Monitor weight and electrolytes. Educate mother on non-pharmacological comfort measures. Document all interventions and observations. Assess for other complications of NAS. Encourage mother-baby bonding as appropriate."
