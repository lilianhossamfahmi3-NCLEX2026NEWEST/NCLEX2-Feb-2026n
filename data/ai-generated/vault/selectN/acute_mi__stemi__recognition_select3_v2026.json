He states the pain started approximately 30 minutes ago and is unrelieved by rest. Assessment: Patient is alert and oriented. Complains of severe, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm. Vital signs: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 24, SpO2 94% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Patient is diaphoretic and anxious. He denies any allergies. Medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. He took aspirin at home prior to arrival. 07:15 Patient states pain is now 8/10. Administered oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. 07:30 New onset of nausea. 07:45 Patient's blood pressure is now 100/60. Recommendation: Prepare for immediate intervention, likely cardiac catheterization. Consider administration of morphine for pain relief and further assessment of cardiac enzymes."

    "option_2": "Incorrect. A potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L is within the normal range and does not suggest an acute STEMI. While electrolyte imbalances can affect cardiac function, this value is not immediately concerning.",
    "option_3": "Correct. Sudden onset of severe, crushing chest pain is a classic symptom of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and warrants immediate investigation and intervention.",
    "option_4": "Incorrect. A blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, while slightly low, is not the most critical finding in the context of suspected STEMI. The focus should be on the chest pain and ECG changes.",
    "option_5": "Correct. An elevated Troponin I level of 0.8 ng/mL (reference range: <0.04 ng/mL) confirms myocardial damage, supporting the diagnosis of acute MI.",
    "option_6": "Incorrect. An oxygen saturation of 96% on room air is within acceptable limits and does not indicate acute respiratory distress related to STEMI. However, supplemental oxygen is still warranted.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect. Chest pain relieved by antacids suggests a gastrointestinal cause, such as acid reflux or esophageal spasm, rather than cardiac ischemia. The patient's description of 'crushing' pain makes cardiac etiology more likely. ",
    "option_8": "Incorrect. Diaphoresis can be associated with myocardial infarction; however, it is less specific than ST elevation, troponin elevation, and crushing chest pain. Given that we need to select the *most* likely findings, diaphoresis is lower on the list.",
