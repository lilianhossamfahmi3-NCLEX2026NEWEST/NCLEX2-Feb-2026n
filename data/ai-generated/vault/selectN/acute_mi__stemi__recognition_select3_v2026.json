        "option_3": "Correct. Sudden onset of severe, crushing chest pain is a classic symptom of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and warrants immediate investigation and intervention to rule out or confirm a STEMI.",
        "option_4": "Incorrect. A blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, while trending low, is not the most critical finding in the context of a suspected STEMI. The focus should be on the chest pain, ECG changes, and cardiac biomarkers.",
        "option_5": "Correct. An elevated Troponin I level of 0.8 ng/mL (reference range: <0.04 ng/mL) confirms myocardial damage, supporting the diagnosis of acute MI and indicating the need for immediate intervention.",
        "option_6": "Incorrect. An oxygen saturation of 96% on room air is within acceptable limits and does not indicate acute respiratory distress directly related to STEMI. However, supplemental oxygen is still appropriate.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect. Chest pain relieved by antacids suggests a gastrointestinal cause, such as acid reflux or esophageal spasm, rather than cardiac ischemia. The patient's description of 'crushing' pain makes cardiac etiology more likely, despite the report of relief with antacids.",
        "option_8": "Incorrect. While diaphoresis can be associated with myocardial infarction, it is a non-specific symptom. The ST-segment elevation, crushing chest pain, and elevated troponin are more definitive indicators of STEMI.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: The combination of ST-segment elevation on ECG, severe crushing chest pain, and elevated troponin levels strongly suggests an acute STEMI. These findings necessitate immediate intervention, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), to restore blood flow to the affected myocardium and prevent further damage.",
