Resources are stretched thin. Assessment: Initial triage underway. Patient flow is chaotic. Red tag area is overflowing. Recommendations: Request additional medical personnel and supplies. Establish clear communication channels. Prioritize patients based on START triage protocol. Need immediate intervention for patients with compromised airway, breathing, or circulation. Re-assess frequently. Implement incident command system effectively. Coordinate with EMS and other responding agencies. Ensure scene safety and security. Address psychological needs of victims and staff. Debriefing after event is crucial. 08:15. Continuous assessment and intervention needed."
