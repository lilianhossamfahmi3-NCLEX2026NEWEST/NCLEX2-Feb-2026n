Background: History of hypertension, currently managed with lisinopril. Recent labs show elevated serum osmolality. Assessment: Patient reports persistent thirst and frequent urination, up to 8 liters per day. Vitals: HR 98, BP 100/60, RR 18, Temp 37.1°C. Skin tenting noted. Urine output significantly elevated over the past 24 hours. Neuro status is alert and oriented x3. Concerns: Possible diabetes insipidus. Risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Requesting orders for desmopressin and further electrolyte monitoring. 07:15 - Spoke with Dr. Smith. New orders pending."

    "a": "Correct. A urine specific gravity of 1.001 indicates very dilute urine, a hallmark of diabetes insipidus due to the kidney's inability to concentrate urine. This requires immediate attention as it contributes to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.",
    "b": "Correct. A serum sodium level of 155 mEq/L is significantly elevated (hypernatremia). This is a common finding in diabetes insipidus due to excessive water loss, requiring prompt intervention to prevent neurological complications.",
    "c": "Incorrect. A urine output of 50 mL/hour, while potentially low in some contexts, is not consistent with the polyuria seen in diabetes insipidus. The client typically has significantly increased urine output.",
    "d": "Incorrect. While excessive thirst (polydipsia) is a symptom of diabetes insipidus, it is a compensatory mechanism for the fluid loss and, while important, is not the most critical finding requiring immediate notification.",
    "e": "Incorrect. Weight gain is not typically associated with diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by fluid loss, not retention. Weight loss or no change in weight is more common.",
    "f": "Correct. Decreased skin turgor is a sign of dehydration, which is a major complication of diabetes insipidus due to the excessive fluid loss. This finding warrants immediate action to prevent further dehydration.",
    "g": "Incorrect. A blood glucose of 110 mg/dL is within the normal range and does not directly indicate a complication of diabetes insipidus. While important to monitor, it is not a priority in this context.",
    "correct": "Clinical rationale pending deep clinical alignment."
