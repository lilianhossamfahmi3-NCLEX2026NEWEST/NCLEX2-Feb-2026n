Background: Patient self-administered epinephrine pen immediately after the sting. He has a history of asthma, controlled with albuterol PRN. Assessment: On arrival, the patient reports increasing shortness of breath and throat tightness. He appears anxious and is speaking in short sentences. Medications include albuterol inhaler (PRN). Allergies include bees. Code status is full. Request: I am concerned about the patient's rapidly deteriorating respiratory status and signs of anaphylactic shock. I recommend immediate administration of epinephrine, oxygen, and continuous monitoring. I also recommend preparing for possible intubation. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 30, SpO2 92% on room air. Lungs: Audible wheezing and stridor. Skin: Diffuse urticaria and angioedema noted. 14:45 Update: BP 70/40, HR 130, RR 35, SpO2 88% despite supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Decreased level of consciousness noted."

    "option_1": "Correct: A systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg indicates hypotension and is a sign of systemic collapse due to vasodilation and decreased cardiac output in anaphylactic shock.",

    "option_3": "Incorrect: Clear lung sounds bilaterally would be an unexpected finding in anaphylactic shock, where bronchospasm and airway edema typically cause wheezing and stridor.",
    "option_4": "Correct: Audible wheezing and stridor indicate severe bronchospasm and upper airway obstruction, which are critical signs of respiratory compromise and systemic collapse.",
    "option_5": "Incorrect: An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air would be an unexpected finding in anaphylactic shock, where respiratory compromise leads to decreased oxygenation.",
    "option_6": "Correct: A decreased level of consciousness suggests hypoperfusion of the brain, indicating systemic collapse due to inadequate blood flow.",
    "option_7": "Incorrect: While tachycardia is common, a bounding pulse is less typical in anaphylactic shock where weak pulses are more indicative of low blood pressure."
