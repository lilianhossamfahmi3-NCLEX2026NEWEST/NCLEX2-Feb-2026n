Background: Patient self-administered epinephrine pen immediately after the sting. He has a history of asthma, controlled with albuterol PRN. Assessment: On arrival, the patient reports increasing shortness of breath and throat tightness. He appears anxious and is speaking in short sentences. Medications include albuterol inhaler (PRN). Allergies include bees. Code status is full. Request: I am concerned about the patient's rapidly deteriorating respiratory status and signs of anaphylactic shock. I recommend immediate administration of epinephrine, oxygen, and continuous monitoring. I also recommend preparing for possible intubation. Vital signs: BP 90/60, HR 120, RR 30, SpO2 92% on room air. Lungs: Audible wheezing and stridor. Skin: Diffuse urticaria and angioedema noted. 14:45 Update: BP 70/40, HR 130, RR 35, SpO2 88% despite supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Decreased level of consciousness noted."

        "option_2": "Incorrect: Diffuse urticaria and angioedema are common manifestations of anaphylaxis, but they do not directly indicate systemic collapse. While important to address, they are not the priority over signs of respiratory or circulatory failure.",
        "option_3": "Incorrect: Clear lung sounds bilaterally are not consistent with anaphylactic shock, which typically presents with wheezing and stridor due to bronchospasm and airway edema. This finding would suggest an alternative diagnosis or a less severe reaction.",
        "option_4": "Correct: Audible wheezing and stridor indicate severe bronchospasm and upper airway obstruction, which are critical signs of respiratory compromise and systemic collapse. Immediate intervention is needed to secure the airway and improve ventilation.",
        "option_5": "Incorrect: An oxygen saturation of 98% on room air is not consistent with the expected respiratory compromise in anaphylactic shock. The patient would likely exhibit decreased oxygen saturation due to bronchospasm and airway edema.",
        "option_6": "Correct: A decreased level of consciousness suggests hypoperfusion of the brain, indicating systemic collapse due to inadequate blood flow. This requires immediate intervention to improve circulation and oxygen delivery to the brain.",
        "option_7": "Incorrect: While tachycardia is common in anaphylactic shock, a bounding pulse is less typical. Weak or thready pulses are more indicative of low blood pressure and poor perfusion. The focus should be on signs of circulatory failure.",
        "correct": "Clinical rationale: Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The priority findings indicating systemic collapse are hypotension (option 1), respiratory distress (wheezing and stridor, option 4), and altered mental status (decreased level of consciousness, option 6). These findings require immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration and potential death.",
