  "questionTrap": "The primary trap in disaster triage is applying standard hospital emergency department protocols to a pre-hospital mass casualty incident. In a hospital, a pulseless client (Option E) receives immediate CPR. In the field, this same client is tagged BLACK to conserve resources for the living. Another trap is failing to differentiate between degrees of urgency; an open pneumothorax (RED) and a tension pneumothorax (RED) are both immediate life threats, whereas a closed fracture (YELLOW) is not, despite being a serious injury. Remember to prioritize based on the greatest good for the greatest number.",
  "mnemonics": "Use the START triage algorithm: 'RPM' - Respirations, Perfusion, Mental Status. A simple way to remember the RED tag criteria for non-ambulatory patients is '30-2-Can't Do': Respirations over 30/min, Capillary refill over 2 seconds (or no radial pulse), or Can't follow simple commands. Any 'yes' to these indicates a RED tag. The four triage colors can be remembered as: RED (Immediate), YELLOW (Delayed), GREEN (Minor/Walking Wounded), BLACK (Expectant/Deceased).",

RED tags are assigned to those with immediate life-threatening conditions that require immediate intervention. The clients with an arterial bleed, open pneumothorax, and tension pneumothorax all require immediate intervention to prevent death."
