            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This client requires a RED tag. An uncontrolled, spurting arterial bleed leads to rapid exsanguination. Pathophysiologically, this causes a precipitous drop in circulating blood volume, leading to decreased preload, reduced cardiac output, and profound hypotension (hypovolemic shock). Without immediate intervention (direct pressure, tourniquet), systemic tissue perfusion will fail, resulting in cellular hypoxia, anaerobic metabolism, lactic acidosis, and irreversible organ damage within minutes. This is a critical, but salvageable, threat to circulation."
        },
        "b": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This client requires a RED tag. An open pneumothorax, or 'sucking chest wound,' allows atmospheric air to enter the pleural space, equalizing the pressure and causing the lung to collapse. This creates a severe ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, as blood flows past non-ventilated alveoli, leading to profound hypoxemia. The client's respiratory distress indicates an immediate threat to breathing and gas exchange that requires urgent intervention (e.g., occlusive dressing) to restore negative intrathoracic pressure and re-expand the lung."
        },
        "c": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This client should be assigned a GREEN (Minor) tag. In mass casualty triage (e.g., START system), the ability to walk to a designated area automatically categorizes a victim as 'walking wounded.' While 2nd-degree burns over 10% TBSA require medical attention, this client's ambulatory status demonstrates that their airway, breathing, and circulation are currently stable and not under immediate threat. They can safely wait for treatment after more critical patients are managed."
        },
        "d": {
            "isCorrect": true,
            "content": "This client requires a RED tag. A tension pneumothorax is a catastrophic emergency where a one-way air leak into the pleural space causes a progressive buildup of pressure. This pressure completely collapses the affected lung and causes a mediastinal shift, compressing the heart and great vessels. The tracheal deviation is a late sign of this severe compression, which obstructs venous return to the heart, causing a rapid drop in cardiac output (obstructive shock) and leading to imminent cardiovascular collapse. Immediate needle decompression is required to save this client's life."

        "e": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This client should be assigned a BLACK (Expectant/Deceased) tag. In a mass casualty setting with limited resources, a client who is apneic and pulseless is considered unsalvageable. The fixed and dilated pupils indicate severe anoxic brain injury has already occurred. The principle of 'doing the greatest good for the greatest number' dictates that life-saving efforts and resources must be allocated to victims with a higher chance of survival. Attempting resuscitation on this client would divert personnel from treating RED-tagged victims."

        "f": {
            "isCorrect": false,
            "content": "This client should be assigned a YELLOW (Delayed) tag. A closed fracture of the radius is a significant injury but does not pose an immediate threat to life, limb, or eyesight. The client's airway, breathing, and circulation are intact. While the client is in pain, they can wait several hours for definitive treatment (e.g., reduction, casting) without a substantial decline in their condition. Their perfusion and mental status are presumed to be within normal limits for triage purposes."
        }
    },
    "questionTrap": "The primary trap in disaster triage is applying standard hospital emergency department protocols to a pre-hospital mass casualty incident. In a hospital, a pulseless client (Option E) receives immediate CPR. In the field, this same client is tagged BLACK to conserve resources for the living. Another trap is failing to differentiate between degrees of urgency; an open pneumothorax (RED) and a tension pneumothorax (RED) are both immediate life threats, whereas a closed fracture (YELLOW) is not, despite being a serious injury.",
    "mnemonics": "Use the START triage algorithm: 'RPM' - Respirations, Perfusion, Mental Status. A simple way to remember the RED tag criteria for non-ambulatory patients is '30-2-Can't Do': Respirations over 30/min, Capillary refill over 2 seconds (or no radial pulse), or Can't follow simple commands. Any 'yes' to these indicates a RED tag. The four triage colors can be remembered as: RED (Immediate), YELLOW (Delayed), GREEN (Minor/Walking Wounded), BLACK (Expectant/Deceased)."
