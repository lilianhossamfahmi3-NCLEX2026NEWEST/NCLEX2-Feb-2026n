In a hospital, a pulseless client (Option E) receives immediate CPR. In the field, this same client is tagged BLACK to conserve resources for the living. Another trap is failing to differentiate between degrees of urgency; an open pneumothorax (RED) and a tension pneumothorax (RED) are both immediate life threats, whereas a closed fracture (YELLOW) is not, despite being a serious injury. Remember to prioritize based on the greatest good for the greatest number."

Any 'yes' to these indicates a RED tag. The four triage colors can be remembered as: RED (Immediate), YELLOW (Delayed), GREEN (Minor/Walking Wounded), BLACK (Expectant/Deceased)."
