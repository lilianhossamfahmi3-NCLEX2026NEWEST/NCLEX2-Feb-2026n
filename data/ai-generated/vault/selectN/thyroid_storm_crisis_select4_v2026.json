Background: J.B. has been managing her Graves' disease with methimazole, but admits to inconsistent adherence to her medication regimen over the past month. Assessment: J.B. is alert but agitated. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 170 bpm, RR 28, Temp 104.5°F (40.3°C), SpO2 96% on room air. She reports feeling increasingly hot and restless since this morning. She also complains of nausea and abdominal discomfort. Current medications include methimazole 5mg daily, as prescribed, but not consistently taken. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention for possible thyroid storm, including IV fluids, beta-blockers, cooling measures, and further evaluation by endocrinology. Labs are pending. Please expedite orders and consult."

    "b": "Correct. A heart rate of 170 bpm indicates severe tachycardia, a critical manifestation of thyroid storm that can lead to cardiac complications.",
    "c": "Incorrect. A blood glucose of 110 mg/dL is within the normal range and not indicative of thyroid storm.",
    "d": "Correct. Agitation and confusion are neurological signs of thyroid storm due to the effects of excess thyroid hormones on the central nervous system.",
    "e": "Incorrect. A systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg is within normal limits and does not indicate hypertensive crisis associated with thyroid storm.",
    "f": "Incorrect. While headache can occur, a mild headache is not a primary indicator of the severity of thyroid storm.",
    "g": "Correct. Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) is a common symptom of thyroid storm due to increased metabolic rate and heat production."
