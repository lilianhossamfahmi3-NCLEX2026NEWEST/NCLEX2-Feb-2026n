Background: Patient reports clear fluid leakage. Initial FHR was 130s, moderate variability. No meconium noted. Assessment: At 14:15, after SROM, FHR dropped suddenly to 70 bpm with minimal variability. A cord prolapse is suspected. Patient reports feeling pressure. Vitals: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 20. Recommendation: Immediate intervention required to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord and expedite delivery. Notify MD immediately. Consider amnioinfusion if available."
