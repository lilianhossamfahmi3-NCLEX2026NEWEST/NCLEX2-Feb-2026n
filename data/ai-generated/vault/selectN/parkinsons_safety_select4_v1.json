  "answerBreakdown": {
    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Area rugs pose a significant tripping hazard for clients with Parkinson's disease due to their shuffling gait and impaired balance. Parkinson's disease results from dopamine depletion in the substantia nigra, leading to basal ganglia dysfunction. This disruption causes bradykinesia (slow movement) and postural instability, increasing the risk of falls. Removing rugs creates a safer, obstacle-free environment. **Clinical Pearl:** Conduct a thorough home safety assessment to identify and eliminate potential fall hazards."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. 'Freezing of gait' (FOG) is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease, characterized by a temporary inability to initiate or continue walking. This phenomenon is related to impaired basal ganglia function and the inability to generate internal cues for movement. Rocking back and forth provides an external cue that can help overcome this 'freezing' episode and initiate movement. **Clinical Pearl:** Teach the client and family members strategies to manage FOG, such as stepping over imaginary lines or using a laser pointer to provide a visual cue."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. Looking down at the feet while walking exacerbates postural instability in clients with Parkinson's disease. The disease affects the neural pathways responsible for balance and coordination. Shifting the gaze downward alters the center of gravity and reduces visual input needed for maintaining balance, increasing the risk of falls. Clients should be instructed to maintain an upright posture and look ahead. **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage clients to focus on a distant point to improve balance and gait."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. A walker or cane with a wide base of support provides external stability for clients with Parkinson's disease, compensating for impaired balance and postural reflexes. The wide base increases the client's stability and reduces the risk of falls, especially during turns or on uneven surfaces. **Clinical Pearl:** Ensure the assistive device is properly fitted and that the client receives instruction on its safe use."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct. Parkinson's disease often causes a shuffling gait with reduced stride length and decreased foot clearance. Instructing the client to consciously lift their toes when stepping (heel-to-toe gait) helps to increase foot clearance and reduce the risk of tripping. This technique requires conscious effort to override the automatic, impaired gait pattern. **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage regular exercise and physical therapy to maintain mobility and improve gait."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect. A soft, plush mattress can make it difficult for clients with Parkinson's disease to move and change positions in bed due to bradykinesia and rigidity. A firmer mattress provides better support and facilitates easier movement, promoting independence and reducing the risk of falls when getting in and out of bed. **Clinical Pearl:** Assess the client's sleeping environment and recommend modifications to promote safety and comfort."
    }
  },
  "pathophysiology": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter essential for motor control, and its deficiency leads to the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons disrupts the basal ganglia circuitry, affecting the initiation and execution of voluntary movements. Non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances, are also common. The disease's impact on motor function significantly increases the risk of falls and injuries, necessitating comprehensive safety interventions.",
  "questionTrap": "The question trap lies in selecting options that seem generally helpful for safety but are contraindicated in Parkinson's disease. For example, looking at the feet while walking might seem like a cautious approach, but it actually worsens balance problems. Similarly, a soft mattress might seem comfortable, but it hinders movement. The correct answers address the specific motor deficits associated with Parkinson's disease and provide compensatory strategies.",
