    "answerBreakdown": {
        "a": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. Parkinson's disease causes a characteristic shuffling gait (festination) due to bradykinesia and rigidity. Dopamine depletion in the substantia nigra impairs the basal ganglia's ability to regulate smooth, voluntary movement, resulting in small steps where the feet barely clear the floor. An area rug's edge creates a significant tripping hazard that can easily lead to a fall, which is particularly dangerous given the client's impaired postural reflexes (righting reflexes)."
        },
        "b": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. This technique addresses 'freezing of gait' (FOG), a form of akinesia where the client feels their feet are glued to the floor. FOG is a failure of the dysfunctional basal ganglia to generate an internal cue for movement. Rocking side-to-side provides a strong, rhythmic proprioceptive and vestibular stimulus that acts as an external cue, effectively bypassing the internal motor block and helping to initiate the first step."
        },
        "c": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. This is a dangerous action for a client with Parkinson's. Postural instability is a cardinal symptom due to degeneration of neural pathways controlling balance. Looking down at the feet shifts the center of gravity forward, further destabilizing an already precarious posture. It also eliminates crucial peripheral visual cues from the environment that are used to maintain orientation and balance, thereby increasing the risk of falls."
        },
        "d": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. Postural instability and bradykinesia severely compromise balance. The basal ganglia's dysfunction impairs the automatic postural adjustments needed to stay upright. An assistive device with a wide base, such as a four-wheeled walker or a quad cane, significantly increases the client's base of support. This provides external stability, compensating for the internal neurological deficits and reducing the risk of falls, especially during turns or on uneven surfaces."
        },
        "e": {
            "correct": true,
            "content": "Correct. The shuffling, festinating gait is characterized by a failure to achieve adequate foot clearance. Instructing the client to consciously think about lifting their toes and placing their heel down first is a cognitive strategy to override the dysfunctional automatic gait pattern. This intentional exaggeration of the normal gait cycle forces a longer stride, improves foot clearance off the ground, and directly counteracts the shuffling, reducing the risk of tripping over one's own feet."
        },
        "f": {
            "correct": false,
            "content": "Incorrect. Bradykinesia and rigidity make initiating and executing movements, like turning in bed, extremely difficult. A soft mattress allows the body to sink in, creating resistance and requiring immense muscular effort to change position. This increases fatigue and the risk of pressure injuries. A firm mattress provides a stable surface to push off from, facilitating easier movement and promoting independence and safety when getting in and out of bed."
        }
    },
    "pathophysiology": "Parkinson's disease is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. This dopamine deficiency disrupts the delicate balance of the basal ganglia's motor circuits (the direct and indirect pathways), which are critical for planning, initiating, and executing smooth, controlled movements. The clinical result is the classic motor triad: bradykinesia (slowness), rigidity (stiffness), and resting tremor. Critically, degeneration also affects non-dopaminergic pathways, leading to postural instability and freezing of gait. The correct interventions are compensatory strategies (environmental, cognitive, and assistive) designed to bypass these specific neurophysiological deficits and mitigate the high risk of falls and injury.",
    "questionTrap": "The primary question trap is the seemingly logical but incorrect advice to 'look at the feet while walking.' Test-takers might choose this based on a general intuition for being careful. However, for a client with Parkinson's, this action is contraindicated because it disrupts the already compromised balance system by shifting the center of gravity forward and removing essential visual cues from the horizon, which are needed for spatial orientation. The correct instruction is to look ahead and scan the environment.",
