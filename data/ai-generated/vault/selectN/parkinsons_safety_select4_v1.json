    "a": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct: Removing area rugs reduces the risk of tripping and falls, a common concern for clients with Parkinson's disease due to impaired balance and shuffling gait. Parkinson's disease affects the basal ganglia, leading to motor control deficits. Eliminating environmental hazards is crucial for safety."
    },
    "b": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct: Rocking back and forth can help initiate movement during 'freezing of gait,' a symptom where clients feel stuck or unable to start walking. This technique provides an external cue to overcome the motor block. Freezing of gait is related to impaired basal ganglia function."
    },
    "c": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect: Looking at the feet while walking can worsen balance problems in Parkinson's disease. Clients should focus on looking ahead to maintain an upright posture and improve balance. Parkinson's affects postural reflexes, making it harder to maintain balance."
    },
    "d": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct: Using a walker or cane with a wide base of support provides stability and reduces the risk of falls. Assistive devices compensate for impaired balance and postural instability. A wide base of support increases stability during ambulation."
    },
    "e": {
      "correct": true,
      "content": "Correct: Practicing lifting the toes when stepping (heel-to-toe gait) helps improve foot clearance and reduces the risk of tripping, which is common due to the shuffling gait associated with Parkinson's disease. This technique requires conscious effort to override the impaired gait pattern."
    },
    "f": {
      "correct": false,
      "content": "Incorrect: A soft, plush mattress can make it difficult for clients with Parkinson's disease to move and change positions in bed. A firmer mattress provides better support and facilitates easier movement, reducing the risk of falls when getting in and out of bed. Rigidity and bradykinesia make movement difficult."
    }
  },
  "pathophysiology": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. This dopamine deficiency leads to motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), and postural instability. The disease affects the basal ganglia, which plays a crucial role in motor control. Non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment and depression, can also occur. The motor impairments increase the risk of falls and injuries.",
  "questionTrap": "The question trap lies in selecting options that seem generally helpful but are not appropriate for Parkinson's disease. For example, a soft mattress might seem comfortable, but it hinders movement. Looking at the feet while walking might seem cautious, but it worsens balance. The correct answers address the specific motor deficits and provide compensatory strategies.",
