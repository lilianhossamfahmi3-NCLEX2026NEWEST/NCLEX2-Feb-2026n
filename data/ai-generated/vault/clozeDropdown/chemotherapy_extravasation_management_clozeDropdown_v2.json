        "correct": "Stopping the infusion immediately is crucial to minimize further tissue damage from the vesicant. Vesicants cause blistering and tissue necrosis. Prompt cessation limits the amount of drug delivered to the subcutaneous tissue. Following this, administering the appropriate antidote, if available, is essential to neutralize or counteract the effects of the extravasated chemotherapeutic agent. Hyaluronidase, for instance, is used for extravasation of vinca alkaloids and etoposide, while dexrazoxane is used for anthracycline extravasation. Timely intervention can significantly reduce the severity of tissue damage and long-term complications.",
        "incorrect": "Applying a warm compress can exacerbate the tissue damage caused by some vesicants; cold compresses are generally preferred for certain agents to reduce absorption. Elevating the extremity, while sometimes considered, is not the immediate priority compared to stopping the infusion and administering the appropriate antidote. Analgesics address pain but do not counteract the vesicant's effects. Antiemetics manage nausea and vomiting, which are unrelated to the immediate extravasation injury.",

Vesicant chemotherapy agents can cause significant tissue damage, including blistering, necrosis, and pain. Prompt recognition and management are essential to minimize complications. Initial steps include stopping the infusion, aspirating any residual drug from the IV line, and notifying the physician. Further management depends on the specific agent and may involve antidotes, cold or warm compresses, and elevation of the extremity. Document the incident thoroughly."
