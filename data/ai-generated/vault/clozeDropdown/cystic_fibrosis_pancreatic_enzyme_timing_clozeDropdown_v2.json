        "correct": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is crucial for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates due to pancreatic insufficiency. Administering enzymes *before* meals allows the enzymes to mix with the food in the stomach and small intestine, optimizing digestion. The dosage must be individualized and titrated according to *stool output and steatorrhea* (fatty stools), which reflects the effectiveness of fat absorption. Insufficient enzyme dosage leads to malabsorption, while excessive dosage can cause fibrosing colonopathy.",
        "incorrect": "Administering pancreatic enzymes *after* meals delays the digestive process and reduces their effectiveness because the food bolus has already begun to pass through the stomach before the enzymes can act. *Intermittent* administration will also lead to malabsorption. Relying solely on *serum amylase levels* is not an accurate reflection of pancreatic enzyme activity in the intestinal lumen or the degree of malabsorption. *Patient weight alone* is insufficient to adjust pancreatic enzyme dosage, as it does not directly reflect the efficacy of fat absorption or the presence of steatorrhea. Weight may be affected by many factors, not simply digestion.",

Optimal enzyme timing involves administration *before* meals and snacks, allowing enzymes to mix with food in the stomach and small intestine.

Monitoring for adequate growth and nutritional status is essential, as is educating families on enzyme administration, stool assessment, and dietary management to prevent malabsorption complications."
