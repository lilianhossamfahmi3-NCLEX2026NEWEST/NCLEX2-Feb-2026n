    "correct": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting the exocrine glands, primarily the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, and reproductive organs. The primary defect involves a mutation in the CFTR gene, leading to the production of abnormally thick and sticky mucus. This mucus obstructs the pancreatic ducts, impairing the secretion of pancreatic enzymes (lipase, amylase, protease) necessary for digestion and absorption of nutrients, particularly fats and proteins. (1) Therefore, supplemental pancreatic enzymes are crucial with every meal and snack to aid in digestion and prevent malabsorption, which can lead to malnutrition and steatorrhea. (2) Furthermore, individuals with CF have increased energy expenditure due to chronic respiratory infections, increased work of breathing, and malabsorption. A high-calorie, high-protein, and high-fat diet is essential to meet these increased energy demands, promote growth, and maintain optimal nutritional status. This diet helps to compensate for malabsorption and provides the necessary building blocks for tissue repair and immune function.",
    "incorrect": "Low-protein/sodium diets are typically prescribed for renal patients to manage fluid and electrolyte balance and reduce the workload on the kidneys. Insulin injections are used to manage diabetes mellitus, not CF. While individuals with CF may develop CF-related diabetes (CFRD), insulin is not a universal treatment. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, but are not a routine part of CF nutritional management. Pancreatic enzymes must be taken *with* food to be effective in aiding digestion.",

The patient's parents demonstrate understanding of medication administration and airway clearance techniques. However, they express concern about meeting the patient's nutritional needs at home.",
      "recommendation": "I recommend reinforcing education on pancreatic enzyme administration with every meal and snack, emphasizing the importance of a high-calorie, high-protein, and high-fat diet. Refer the family to a registered dietitian for individualized meal planning and nutritional support. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist and gastroenterologist within one week. Ensure the family has adequate supplies of pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble vitamins prior to discharge. Consider home health nursing visits for ongoing support and monitoring of nutritional status."
