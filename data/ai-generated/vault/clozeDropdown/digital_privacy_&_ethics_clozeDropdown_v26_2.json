Disclosing information without consent, even unintentionally, violates these principles and erodes patient trust. Sharing identifiable patient data on social media or through unsecured channels is a direct breach of privacy. Utilizing secure communication methods and adhering to institutional policies ensures compliance with legal and ethical standards. Educating patients about their rights and the measures taken to protect their data further promotes transparency and trust. The rise of telehealth and electronic health records necessitates heightened awareness and proactive measures to safeguard patient information against unauthorized access or disclosure.",
