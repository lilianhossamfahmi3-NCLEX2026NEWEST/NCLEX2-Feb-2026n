            "correct": "Maintaining patient confidentiality is a cornerstone of nursing ethics, reinforced by HIPAA regulations. Disclosing patient information without explicit consent constitutes a breach of privacy, eroding trust and potentially leading to legal repercussions. Sharing identifiable patient data via unencrypted channels, such as social media or unsecured email, directly violates these principles. Utilizing secure communication methods, adhering to institutional policies, and obtaining informed consent are crucial for compliance. Educating patients about their rights and the measures in place to protect their data fosters transparency and strengthens the nurse-patient relationship. The increasing reliance on telehealth and electronic health records necessitates heightened vigilance and proactive strategies to safeguard patient information against unauthorized access or disclosure. Always verify recipient before sending PHI.",
