        "correct": "Airway patency is the MOST immediate concern post-seizure due to the risk of aspiration. During the tonic phase, respiratory muscles contract, and the clonic phase can lead to decreased consciousness and impaired gag reflex, increasing aspiration risk. A safe and padded environment minimizes the risk of injury during the post-ictal phase, where disorientation and impaired motor control are common. Padding prevents further trauma from falls or uncontrolled movements, while a safe environment reduces potential hazards.",
        "incorrect": "While assessing blood glucose (Blank 1 distractor) and LOC (Blank 1 distractor) are important, they are secondary to ensuring the patient's airway is open and they are breathing. Addressing the airway will prevent hypoxia and brain damage. A quiet and dark environment (Blank 2 distractor) is useful for headache, but safety is paramount. A stimulus-rich environment (Blank 2 distractor) is inappropriate as it can trigger further seizure activity or exacerbate post-ictal agitation and confusion.",
