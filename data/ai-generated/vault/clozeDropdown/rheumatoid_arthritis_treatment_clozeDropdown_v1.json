    "correct": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. The immune system mistakenly attacks the synovium, the lining of the joints, causing inflammation, pain, swelling, and eventual joint damage. (1) Applying warmth, such as a warm shower or moist heat, promotes vasodilation, increasing blood flow to the affected joints. This increased circulation helps to reduce stiffness and pain, making movement easier, especially in the morning when stiffness is often most pronounced. (2) Balancing activity with scheduled rest periods and joint protection is crucial in managing RA. Overexertion can exacerbate inflammation and pain, leading to further joint damage. Rest allows the joints to recover and reduces the stress placed upon them. Joint protection strategies, such as using assistive devices and proper body mechanics, minimize strain and prevent further injury. This approach helps to maintain joint function and prevent deformities.",
    "incorrect": "Applying cold packs can constrict blood vessels, potentially worsening stiffness and pain. Prolonged bed rest can lead to muscle atrophy, joint contractures, and decreased bone density, ultimately hindering joint function and mobility.",

Reinforce the importance of balancing activity with scheduled rest periods and joint protection techniques. Consider consulting with physical therapy for further evaluation and development of a tailored exercise program. Evaluate medication adherence and potential need for adjustments in pain management regimen. Follow up with client to assess effectiveness of interventions."
