    "correct": "Continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber indicates an air leak within the chest tube system. This means air is entering the system, preventing proper lung re-expansion. Tidaling, the fluctuation of fluid levels with respiration, is a normal finding in the water seal chamber, reflecting changes in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration and expiration. Absence of tidaling may indicate lung re-expansion or an obstruction in the tubing. Vigorous bubbling is abnormal and suggests an air leak. The water seal chamber acts as a one-way valve, allowing air to escape from the pleural space but preventing it from re-entering.",
    "incorrect": "Suction bubbling occurs in the suction control chamber, not the water seal chamber. Normal suction operation does not cause continuous bubbling in the water seal. Complete lung re-expansion would eventually lead to the cessation of air leak bubbling, but continuous bubbling indicates an ongoing issue.",

Notify the physician of the continuous bubbling and assessment findings. Prepare supplies for potential chest tube replacement if the leak cannot be identified and resolved."
