    "correct": "An ANC <500/mm³ indicates severe neutropenia, significantly increasing the risk of infection. Protective isolation, including a private room, is crucial to minimize exposure to pathogens. The rationale is that the client's compromised immune system cannot effectively combat opportunistic infections. Fresh fruits and vegetables can harbor bacteria, fungi, and parasites, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus, which can cause severe infections in neutropenic patients. These pathogens are often present on the surface of produce and can be difficult to eliminate completely through washing. Thoroughly cooked meat and pasteurized milk undergo processes that kill or significantly reduce the number of harmful microorganisms, making them safer for consumption by immunocompromised individuals.",
    "incorrect": "Negative-pressure rooms are designed to contain airborne pathogens, such as those causing tuberculosis or measles, and are not appropriate for protecting a neutropenic patient from external sources of infection. Sharing a room with another oncology client, even if they are not actively infected, increases the risk of exposure to potential pathogens. Cooked meat undergoes heat treatment that eliminates most harmful bacteria, making it a safer option than raw or undercooked meat.",

      "recommendation": "I recommend continuing protective isolation precautions, including a private room and avoidance of fresh fruits and vegetables. Monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of infection, and report any changes immediately. Consider administering [medication, e.g., filgrastim] to stimulate WBC production. Consult with the infectious disease team if fever develops."
    },
    "deepPathophysiology": "Neutropenia, defined as an ANC <1000/mm³, results from decreased production or increased destruction of neutrophils. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematologic malignancies, and certain medications can suppress bone marrow function, leading to reduced neutrophil production. Neutrophils are essential for phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and fungi. When neutrophil counts are low, the body's ability to fight infection is severely compromised, making the patient highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. The severity of infection risk is inversely proportional to the ANC; the lower the ANC, the greater the risk. Protective isolation and dietary restrictions are implemented to minimize exposure to potential pathogens and prevent life-threatening infections."
