        "correct": "A wide latch is crucial for effective breastfeeding as it ensures proper stimulation of the milk ducts and efficient milk transfer. When the infant takes in more areola than nipple, it allows for a deeper and more comfortable latch, reducing the risk of nipple pain and trauma for the mother. Softening of the breast after feeding is a key indicator that the infant is effectively removing milk. This softening indicates that the milk ducts have been emptied, which helps to prevent engorgement and supports continued milk production. Effective milk transfer also aids in the excretion of bilirubin, preventing jaundice.",
        "incorrect": "A shallow latch can cause nipple pain and ineffective milk transfer, leading to inadequate weight gain for the infant and potential breast problems for the mother. Nipple grasp focuses only on the nipple, leading to discomfort and insufficient milk drainage. Increased jaundice after feeding would indicate that the infant is not feeding effectively, leading to the buildup of bilirubin. Regurgitation is a normal phenomenon in newborns but is not a reliable indicator of milk transfer. Regurgitation should be distinguished from forceful vomiting.",

This ensures proper stimulation of milk ducts and prevents nipple soreness. Indicators of successful breastfeeding include audible swallowing, softening of the breast after feeding, and adequate weight gain. Proper positioning and support for both mother and baby are crucial for achieving a comfortable and effective latch. Monitoring for signs of jaundice is also essential, as effective breastfeeding promotes bilirubin excretion through frequent stools."
