The goal is to achieve a urine output of at least 100-200 mL/hr. Monitoring serum creatine kinase (CK) levels is essential; a {{blank1}} suggests effective treatment. Furthermore, electrolyte abnormalities are common; therefore, close monitoring and correction, especially of {{blank2}}, are vital in preventing cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.",

    "correct": "A decreasing CK level indicates that the rate of muscle breakdown is slowing down, suggesting that the treatment is effective in limiting further muscle damage. Aggressive fluid resuscitation helps to flush out myoglobin and other toxic intracellular components released from damaged muscle cells, reducing the risk of acute kidney injury. Correcting hyperkalemia is critical because elevated potassium levels can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and asystole. The continuous monitoring of CK allows for the rapid adjustment of treatment strategies, ensuring that renal function is preserved and electrolyte imbalances are promptly addressed, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality associated with rhabdomyolysis.",
    "incorrect": "A stable CK level may indicate that muscle damage is neither worsening nor improving significantly, implying that the current treatment regimen may not be adequately effective in reducing muscle breakdown. A fluctuating CK level would suggest inconsistent control over the underlying muscle damage. Hyponatremia and hypocalcemia, while potentially occurring in other contexts, are not the most immediate and life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities associated with rhabdomyolysis, unlike hyperkalemia, which directly impacts cardiac function and can cause fatal arrhythmias. These electrolytes should also be monitored but are not the priority.",

Myoglobin can cause acute kidney injury, while hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

Monitoring CK levels helps assess the effectiveness of treatment and guide further interventions. Continuous assessment is critical to prevent life-threatening complications."
