        "correct": "Intussusception occurs when a segment of the intestine telescopes into another, most commonly at the ileocecal valve. This obstruction leads to inflammation, edema, and decreased blood flow to the affected bowel segment. The compromised blood supply results in ischemia and the characteristic 'currant jelly' stools, which are a mixture of blood and mucus. The telescoping bowel forms a palpable, sausage-shaped mass in the abdomen, often in the right upper quadrant.",
        "incorrect": "An olive-shaped mass is characteristic of pyloric stenosis, a condition involving hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter. Steatorrhea (oily, foul-smelling stools) is associated with malabsorption disorders such as cystic fibrosis or celiac disease, where fat digestion is impaired. Clay-colored stools indicate biliary obstruction, preventing bilirubin from reaching the intestines.",

Possible intussusception.\nBackground: 6-month-old male, previously healthy, no known allergies. Immunizations up to date. Mother reports intermittent episodes of inconsolable crying, drawing knees to chest, followed by periods of lethargy. Noted one episode of vomiting and a bloody stool at 1400.\nAssessment: Infant appears pale and lethargic. Abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. A sausage-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant. Vital signs: HR 160, RR 40, BP 90/60, Temp 38.5°C (101.3°F). Stool sample pending.\nRecommendation: STAT surgical consult for possible intussusception reduction. NPO status. Initiate IV fluids (NS) at maintenance rate. Monitor vital signs and abdominal assessment closely. Prepare for possible air or saline enema under fluoroscopy."
