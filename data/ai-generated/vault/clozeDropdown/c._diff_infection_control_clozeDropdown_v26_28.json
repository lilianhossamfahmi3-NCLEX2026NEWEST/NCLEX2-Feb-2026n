To prevent the spread of infection, the nurse should first {{blank1}} and then {{blank2}}. Given the patient's compromised state and the highly contagious nature of C. difficile, meticulous adherence to infection control protocols is paramount. The nurse's initial response directly impacts the risk of nosocomial transmission to other vulnerable patients and healthcare personnel. Implementing these measures swiftly and correctly demonstrates a commitment to patient safety and professional responsibility. Prioritizing contact precautions and proper hand hygiene is essential in managing this infectious disease. Remember that preventing the spread of infection is the priority. Initial actions should focus on implementing contact precautions and proper hand hygiene. The critical first steps in managing a patient with C. difficile are crucial in mitigating the risk of transmission to other patients and healthcare workers. Immediate implementation of these measures is essential to prevent the spread of the infection.",

    "correct": "Contact precautions are essential in preventing the spread of C. difficile. This involves donning a gown and gloves upon entering the patient's room. Hand hygiene with soap and water is critical because alcohol-based sanitizers are ineffective against C. difficile spores. Soap and water physically remove the spores from the hands. Disinfecting equipment with bleach prevents cross-contamination to other patients.",
    "incorrect": "Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is ineffective against C. difficile spores; soap and water are required for hand hygiene. Standard precautions are insufficient for C. difficile, which requires contact precautions. While a private room is ideal, it may not always be available, and the immediate need to initiate contact precautions and perform hand hygiene with soap and water takes precedence. Donning sterile gloves is unnecessary and impractical; clean gloves are sufficient for contact precautions. Antibiotics are important but not the immediate first step. Delegating vital signs is inappropriate at this stage.",
