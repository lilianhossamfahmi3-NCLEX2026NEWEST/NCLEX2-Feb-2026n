        "correct": "In Diabetes Insipidus (DI), a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a resistance to its effects at the kidneys leads to an inability to concentrate urine. ADH, produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary, regulates water reabsorption in the kidneys. Without sufficient ADH, the distal tubules and collecting ducts become less permeable to water. This results in the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine (low specific gravity) and subsequent dehydration. The body attempts to compensate by increasing fluid intake, but if fluid intake cannot keep pace with urinary losses, hypernatremia (increased serum sodium) develops as the blood becomes more concentrated. This hyperosmolar state can lead to cellular dehydration and neurological symptoms.",

Vital signs: BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 20, Temp 37.0°C (98.6°F). Current time is 1400.\nRecommendation: I recommend administering desmopressin (DDAVP) as prescribed and initiating IV fluid replacement with hypotonic saline (0.45% NaCl) to correct the hypernatremia. Monitor urine output and serum sodium levels hourly. Assess neurological status frequently for signs of worsening dehydration or hypernatremia. Consider obtaining a vasopressin level to confirm the diagnosis of central DI."
