Patients are categorized using systems such as START triage, prioritizing those with the highest likelihood of survival given available resources. Expectant patients, often tagged black, have injuries so severe that they are unlikely to survive, even with intensive medical intervention; therefore, resources are allocated to those with a higher probability of survival. Massive head trauma often indicates severe and irreversible brain damage, leading to a poor prognosis in an MCI where resources are stretched thin.",
        "incorrect": "Patient preferences are considered in standard medical care but are secondary to resource availability and survival probability in a mass casualty scenario. Staff experience does not dictate triage prioritization; standardized triage protocols guide decisions. A fractured femur, while serious, is treatable, and the patient would likely be tagged as urgent (red) or delayed (yellow), depending on other injuries and resource availability. Minor burns would typically be categorized as minimal (green) and would not be a priority in a mass casualty event. These patients are considered 'walking wounded'.",

The core principle revolves around prioritizing patients based on their likelihood of survival with the resources available. The START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) system is a widely used method that quickly categorizes patients into immediate (red), delayed (yellow), minimal (green), and expectant (black) categories. This rapid assessment allows medical personnel to efficiently allocate resources and provide the best possible care under dire circumstances. Ethical considerations, such as beneficence and utilitarianism, are central to triage decision-making in these situations."
