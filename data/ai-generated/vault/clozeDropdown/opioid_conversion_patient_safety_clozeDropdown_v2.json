        "correct": "The conversion requires two steps. First, convert oral morphine to IV morphine: 30 mg oral morphine / 3 = 10 mg IV morphine. Second, convert IV morphine to IV hydromorphone: 10 mg IV morphine / 5 = 2 mg IV hydromorphone. Therefore, 2 mg of IV hydromorphone is the approximate equianalgesic dose. Opioid toxicity is the greatest safety concern. Rapid conversion can lead to opioid-induced respiratory depression, as hydromorphone is a potent opioid. Monitoring respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness are essential to detect toxicity early.",
        "incorrect": "5 mg is incorrect because it does not follow the correct conversion calculation. The correct calculation necessitates converting oral morphine to IV morphine (30mg / 3 = 10mg) and then IV morphine to IV hydromorphone (10mg / 5 = 2mg). Withdrawal is incorrect because the patient is being converted from one opioid to another, maintaining opioid receptor stimulation. Tolerance is incorrect because, although tolerance is a factor in long-term opioid therapy, the immediate concern during conversion is avoiding toxicity from the new, potentially more potent opioid.",
