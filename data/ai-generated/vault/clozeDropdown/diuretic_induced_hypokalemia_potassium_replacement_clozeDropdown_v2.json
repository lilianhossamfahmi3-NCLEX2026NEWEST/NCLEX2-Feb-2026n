    "correct": "Verifying renal function is crucial because the kidneys are responsible for excreting potassium. Impaired renal function can lead to hyperkalemia if the kidneys cannot effectively eliminate the administered potassium. Assessing for cardiac arrhythmias is essential as rapid potassium administration can cause life-threatening cardiac complications, including peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and ultimately, cardiac arrest. The heart's electrical activity is highly sensitive to potassium imbalances, and a sudden increase can disrupt normal conduction pathways.",
    "incorrect": "Checking blood pressure is important in general patient assessment but is not the priority assessment before administering potassium. While diuretics can affect blood pressure, the immediate concern is potassium balance. Assessing bowel sounds is important for patients with gastrointestinal issues, but not directly related to acute complications of potassium administration. Muscle weakness can be a symptom of both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia, but is not the immediate focus during rapid administration; cardiac effects are more urgent.",

Potassium replacement is often necessary, but it must be administered cautiously. Rapid potassium administration can lead to severe cardiac arrhythmias, and impaired renal function can cause hyperkalemia. Monitoring serum potassium levels and assessing renal function are crucial to prevent adverse outcomes. Additionally, educating patients about potassium-rich foods and the importance of adherence to prescribed potassium supplements is vital for long-term management."
