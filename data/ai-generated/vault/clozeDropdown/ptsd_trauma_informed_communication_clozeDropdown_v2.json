Re-traumatizing the patient, even unintentionally, can trigger flashbacks, heightened anxiety, and emotional dysregulation due to the reactivation of traumatic memories. This hinders recovery and can lead to further psychological distress.",
        "incorrect": "Challenging the patient's beliefs prematurely can invalidate their experiences and increase resistance to treatment. Ignoring triggers can lead to uncontrolled emotional responses and re-experiencing of the trauma. Encouraging emotional expression too early can overwhelm the patient before they have developed sufficient coping mechanisms. Providing detailed explanations without establishing safety can be perceived as insensitive and create further anxiety. These approaches can undermine the therapeutic relationship and impede progress.",
