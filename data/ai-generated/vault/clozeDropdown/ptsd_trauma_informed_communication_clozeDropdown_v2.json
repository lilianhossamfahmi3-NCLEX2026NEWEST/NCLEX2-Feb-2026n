        "correct": "Establishing safety is paramount in trauma-informed care as it allows the patient to feel secure and in control. This facilitates a therapeutic relationship built on trust. Re-traumatizing the patient, even unintentionally, can trigger flashbacks, heightened anxiety, and emotional dysregulation due to the reactivation of traumatic memories within the amygdala and hippocampus. This negatively impacts their ability to process and integrate the trauma, hindering recovery and potentially leading to further psychological distress.",
        "incorrect": "Challenging the patient's beliefs prematurely can invalidate their experiences and increase resistance to treatment. Ignoring triggers can lead to uncontrolled emotional responses and re-experiencing of the trauma. Encouraging emotional expression too early can overwhelm the patient before they have developed sufficient coping mechanisms. Providing detailed explanations without establishing safety can be perceived as insensitive and create further anxiety. These approaches can undermine the therapeutic relationship and impede progress.",

Remember to avoid triggering language and be mindful of non-verbal cues, ensuring that the patient feels heard and respected throughout the interaction. This framework fosters resilience and empowers patients to regain control over their narratives."
