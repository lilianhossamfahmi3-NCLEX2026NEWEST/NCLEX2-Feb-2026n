    "correct": "Severe dehydration in infants leads to hypovolemic shock. (1) **Sunken fontanelle:** Decreased intravascular volume reduces the pressure within the skull, causing the fontanelle to appear sunken. This is due to the loss of fluid in the interstitial spaces and subsequent reduction in cerebrospinal fluid volume. (2) **Hypotension:** Hypotension is a late and ominous sign of shock. The body initially compensates for fluid loss by increasing heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure. When dehydration becomes severe, these compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to a drop in blood pressure. This indicates inadequate tissue perfusion and potential organ damage.",
    "incorrect": "Bulging fontanelle is a sign of *over*hydration or increased intracranial pressure. This occurs when there is excessive fluid volume or increased pressure within the skull, pushing the fontanelle outward. Hypertension is typically associated with fluid overload or conditions that increase systemic vascular resistance, not dehydration.",
