        "correct": "In placental abruption, premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall leads to bleeding often accompanied by abdominal pain due to uterine contractions and irritation of the uterine musculature. The blood may infiltrate the myometrium, leading to a firm, tender uterus. In contrast, placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os, typically presents with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding as the lower uterine segment thins and the placenta separates slightly from the uterine wall.",
        "incorrect": "Absence of pain is incorrect because placental abruption is characteristically associated with abdominal pain. Severe back pain is also incorrect, although back pain can occur, it is not the primary differentiating symptom. Intense contractions are not typically associated with placenta previa bleeding, which is usually painless. Scant and dark bleeding is more indicative of placental abruption, not placenta previa.",

Placental abruption involves premature separation of the placenta, leading to bleeding and abdominal pain. Placenta previa is characterized by painless, bright red vaginal bleeding due to the placenta covering the cervical os. Accurate differentiation is crucial for appropriate management and fetal outcomes, often requiring ultrasound and careful monitoring. Management depends on gestational age, maternal stability, and fetal condition."
