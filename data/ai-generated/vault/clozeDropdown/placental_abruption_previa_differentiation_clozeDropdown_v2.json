        "correct": "In placental abruption, the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall results in bleeding, often accompanied by abdominal pain due to uterine contractions and irritation of the uterine musculature. The blood may infiltrate the myometrium, leading to a firm, tender uterus. Conversely, placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os, typically presents with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding as the lower uterine segment thins and the placenta separates slightly from the uterine wall. This distinction is critical for guiding appropriate clinical interventions.",
        "incorrect": "Absence of pain is incorrect because placental abruption is characteristically associated with abdominal pain. Severe back pain, while possible, is not the primary differentiating symptom. Intense contractions are not typically associated with placenta previa bleeding, which is usually painless. Scant and dark bleeding is more indicative of placental abruption, not placenta previa. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.",

Placental abruption involves premature separation of the placenta, leading to bleeding and abdominal pain. Placenta previa is characterized by painless, bright red vaginal bleeding due to the placenta covering the cervical os. Accurate differentiation is crucial for appropriate management and fetal outcomes, often requiring ultrasound and careful monitoring. Management depends on gestational age, maternal stability, and fetal condition. Immediate interventions may include fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, and emergency cesarean section."

BACKGROUND: Assess gestational age, previous pregnancies, and any history of bleeding disorders or prior C-sections. ASSESSMENT: Evaluate vital signs, fetal heart rate, and uterine activity. Differentiate between placental abruption (painful, rigid abdomen) and placenta previa (painless, bright red bleeding). Obtain ultrasound to confirm diagnosis. RECOMMENDATION: Monitor maternal and fetal status closely. Prepare for potential interventions such as fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, or emergency C-section based on the diagnosis and severity of the condition."
