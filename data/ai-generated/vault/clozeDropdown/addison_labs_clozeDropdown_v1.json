    "correct": "In Addison's disease, the adrenal cortex is damaged, leading to insufficient production of cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone normally acts on the kidneys to promote sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Without sufficient aldosterone, sodium is lost in the urine, leading to hyponatremia. Simultaneously, potassium excretion is impaired, resulting in hyperkalemia. The decreased sodium contributes to fluid volume deficit and hypotension, while the elevated potassium can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.",
    "incorrect": "Hypernatremia and hypokalemia are characteristic of conditions with excess mineralocorticoid activity, such as Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol) or Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). In these conditions, the excess aldosterone causes increased sodium retention and potassium excretion.",
