    "correct": "Wilms' tumor, or nephroblastoma, is a common pediatric renal malignancy arising from embryonic kidney cells. It typically presents as a unilateral, firm, non-tender abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. The tumor is often encapsulated, but palpation can cause rupture of this capsule, leading to seeding of cancer cells within the peritoneal cavity and subsequent metastasis. Therefore, abdominal palpation is strictly contraindicated. The mass arises from the renal parenchyma, distorting the kidney's normal architecture. Genetic mutations, such as those in the WT1 gene, are implicated in its development. The tumor's growth can also lead to compression of surrounding structures, contributing to symptoms like abdominal pain or distension.",
    "incorrect": "While hypertension can occur in Wilms' tumor due to renin secretion from the tumor, measuring blood pressure is a necessary assessment and should not be avoided. Bloody diarrhea and tenesmus are not typical findings in Wilms' tumor and suggest a different underlying pathology, such as an infectious or inflammatory bowel condition. A soft, scaphoid abdomen is not associated with Wilms' tumor and may indicate dehydration or malnutrition.",
