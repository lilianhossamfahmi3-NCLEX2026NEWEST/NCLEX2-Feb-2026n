  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla that causes the gland to produce excess catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This leads to episodic hypertension, often accompanied by severe pounding headaches and tachycardia. The surge in catecholamines results in vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heightened myocardial contractility. Abdominal palpation is strictly contraindicated because it can stimulate the tumor, causing a sudden and dangerous release of catecholamines into the circulation, potentially leading to hypertensive crisis, stroke, myocardial infarction, or even death.",
    "incorrect": "Bradycardia and hypotension are not associated with pheochromocytoma; the opposite is true. Weight gain and lethargy are also not typical symptoms. Checking peripheral pulses is a routine assessment and does not pose a risk. Percussion of the chest is unrelated to the assessment of pheochromocytoma.",

      "Diagnosis often involves a 24-hour urine collection for VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) and metanephrines to measure catecholamine metabolites. Monitor blood pressure closely, especially during any procedures or interventions. Pre-operative management includes alpha-adrenergic blockade (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) followed by beta-adrenergic blockade (e.g., propranolol) to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crisis. Encourage the client to avoid activities that may trigger an episode, such as stress or certain medications."
