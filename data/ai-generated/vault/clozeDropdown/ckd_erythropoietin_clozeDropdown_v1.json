    "correct": "Epoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), mimics erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow. In CKD, the kidneys' ability to produce erythropoietin is diminished, leading to anemia. Epoetin alfa increases RBC production, which subsequently increases blood viscosity. This increased viscosity can lead to hypertension (the most common side effect) and elevates the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, monitoring blood pressure (BP) before administration is crucial. If the BP is significantly elevated (e.g., systolic BP >180 mmHg or diastolic BP >110 mmHg), the dose should be held and the provider notified. The goal is to maintain a hemoglobin level that reduces the need for blood transfusions while minimizing cardiovascular risks.",
    "incorrect": "ESAs primarily target RBC production and do not directly affect potassium levels or coagulation factors. Hypokalemia is not a common side effect of ESA therapy. While CKD can affect bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction, epoetin alfa does not directly prolong bleeding time. The primary concern with ESAs is the increased risk of hypertension and thrombosis due to increased blood viscosity.",
