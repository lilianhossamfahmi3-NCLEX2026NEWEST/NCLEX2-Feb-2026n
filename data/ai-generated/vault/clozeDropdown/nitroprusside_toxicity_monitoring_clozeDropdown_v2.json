        "correct": "Nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that, during metabolism, can release cyanide ions. Prolonged use or high doses can lead to cyanide toxicity. Thiocyanate is a metabolite of cyanide, and monitoring its levels helps assess the risk of cyanide accumulation. Sodium thiosulfate is a cyanide antidote that facilitates the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate, which is then excreted in the urine. Prompt administration of sodium thiosulfate can prevent severe cyanide poisoning and its associated complications, such as metabolic acidosis and neurological damage.",
        "incorrect": "Creatinine is a marker of renal function and is not directly related to cyanide or thiocyanate levels. Potassium levels are important to monitor in various conditions but do not directly indicate cyanide toxicity from nitroprusside. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse heparin's anticoagulant effects, and calcium gluconate is used to treat hyperkalemia or calcium channel blocker overdose, neither being relevant to cyanide toxicity. While supportive care is crucial, sodium thiosulfate specifically addresses the underlying cause of cyanide poisoning by facilitating its detoxification.",

Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications like metabolic acidosis, neurological damage, and death. Nurses must be vigilant in monitoring for signs of toxicity and administering the antidote promptly."
