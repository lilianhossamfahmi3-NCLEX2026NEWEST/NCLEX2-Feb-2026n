        "correct": "Directly assessing for suicidal ideation with intent is paramount because it indicates the patient has moved beyond passive thoughts of death to actively considering ending their life. The presence of a concrete suicide plan dramatically increases the immediate risk because it signifies the patient has formulated a method, time, and place, suggesting a higher likelihood of acting on their suicidal thoughts. A detailed plan indicates a more advanced stage of suicidal thinking and a greater potential for imminent self-harm. The combination of intent and a plan demands immediate intervention to ensure patient safety.",
        "incorrect": "Family history of depression, while a risk factor for suicide, does not indicate immediate risk as directly as suicidal ideation with intent. While recent job loss can contribute to depression and suicidal thoughts, it does not provide the same level of immediacy as suicidal ideation with intent. Insomnia is a symptom associated with depression and can increase vulnerability to suicidal thoughts, but it's not as direct an indicator as a concrete plan. Vague feelings of hopelessness, while indicative of distress and potential depression, lack the specificity and immediacy of a concrete suicide plan, which represents a tangible threat.",

Continuous monitoring and reassessment are essential to ensure patient safety and prevent suicide."
