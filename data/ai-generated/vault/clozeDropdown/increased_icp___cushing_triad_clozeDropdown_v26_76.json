Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is currently 8. \nB: Patient has a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He was responsive upon admission but has since shown signs of declining neurological status. Initial CT scan revealed cerebral edema.\nA: Current vital signs: BP 180/70 mmHg, HR 55 bpm, RR 12 and irregular, SpO2 95%. ICP monitoring shows a sustained elevation to 22 mmHg. Mannitol 25g IV was administered at 06:30. Neuro checks are being performed hourly. Pupils are sluggishly reactive to light. Auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. Urine output is adequate.\nR: Continue to monitor ICP and neurological status closely. Titrate ventilator settings as needed to maintain PaCO2 between 35-40 mmHg. Consider further interventions to reduce ICP if it remains elevated despite current treatment. Repeat CT scan may be warranted. Consult neurosurgery for further evaluation and management.",
