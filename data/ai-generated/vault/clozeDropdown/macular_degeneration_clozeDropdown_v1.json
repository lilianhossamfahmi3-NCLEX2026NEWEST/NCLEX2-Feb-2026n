    "correct": "AMD affects the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision. (1) Damage to the macula results in a loss of central vision, often described as blurred vision, dark spots, or a 'black hole' in the center of the visual field. (2) The Amsler grid is a diagnostic tool used to detect metamorphopsia (distortion of straight lines), a common symptom of AMD, particularly the wet form. The client is instructed to look at the grid and report any wavy, broken, or missing lines, which indicates progression or worsening of the disease. Pathophysiologically, in dry AMD, drusen (yellow deposits) accumulate under the retina, causing gradual thinning and atrophy of the macula. In wet AMD, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, leaking fluid and blood, leading to rapid vision loss.",

    "deepPathophysiology": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. The pathophysiology differs between the two main types: dry and wet AMD. In dry AMD (also known as non-neovascular or atrophic AMD), the primary feature is the accumulation of drusen, which are yellow deposits composed of lipids, proteins, and cellular debris, beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These drusen disrupt the normal function of the RPE and photoreceptors, leading to gradual thinning and atrophy of the macula. This atrophy results in a slow, progressive loss of central vision. Wet AMD (also known as neovascular or exudative AMD) is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels (choroidal neovascularization or CNV) from the choroid into the subretinal space. These new blood vessels are fragile and leaky, causing fluid and blood to accumulate under the retina. This leakage leads to swelling, distortion, and scarring of the macula, resulting in rapid and severe vision loss. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in the development of CNV. Risk factors for AMD include age, family history, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and exposure to ultraviolet light."
