Assessing the insertion site and connections is the priority to identify and correct the leak.

This position promotes optimal drainage of fluid and air from the pleural cavity, aiding in lung re-expansion and preventing complications.",

Occlusion of the tube would prevent drainage and potentially cause a tension pneumothorax, but is not the primary reason for continuous bubbling. Maintaining the drainage system at or above the level of the chest would impede drainage and could cause backflow of fluid into the pleural space, increasing the risk of infection and compromising lung re-expansion. These positions are contraindicated in chest tube management.",

The drainage system must be kept below the level of the chest to promote effective drainage. Complications such as tension pneumothorax can occur if the system is not functioning correctly, so diligent monitoring and prompt intervention are essential."
