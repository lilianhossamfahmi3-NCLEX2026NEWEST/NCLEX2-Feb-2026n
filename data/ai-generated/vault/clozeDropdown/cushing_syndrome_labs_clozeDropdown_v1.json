    "correct": "In Cushing syndrome, excessive cortisol secretion leads to several metabolic derangements. Cortisol antagonizes insulin, promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in **hyperglycemia**. The elevated cortisol also exhibits mineralocorticoid activity, mimicking aldosterone's effects on the kidneys. This leads to increased sodium and water retention, and increased potassium excretion, resulting in **hypokalemia**. The pathophysiology involves the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects, further exacerbating potassium loss in the distal tubules of the nephrons.",
    "incorrect": "Hyperkalemia is typically associated with Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency), where there is a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone. Hypernatremia is not a typical finding in Cushing's syndrome; sodium levels are usually elevated or normal due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid effects.",

Assessment: Current blood glucose is 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) at 0800. Potassium is 3.2 mEq/L (3.2 mmol/L) at 0800. Recommendation: Initiate insulin sliding scale per protocol. Administer potassium supplement as prescribed. Monitor blood glucose and potassium levels every 4 hours. Notify provider for significant changes."
