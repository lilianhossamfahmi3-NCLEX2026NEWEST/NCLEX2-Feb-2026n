    "correct": "Pain that is unrelieved by opioids and out of proportion to the injury is a hallmark early sign of compartment syndrome. This occurs due to increased pressure within a confined space (the muscle compartment), leading to ischemia and nerve compression. Keeping the limb at heart level (not elevated) is crucial to maintain arterial perfusion to the affected area without increasing hydrostatic pressure, which could worsen the swelling. Prompt notification of the healthcare provider is essential because a fasciotomy (surgical decompression) may be required to relieve the pressure and prevent permanent tissue damage. Delay in treatment can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis, nerve damage, and potentially amputation.",
    "incorrect": "Elevating the limb above the heart is contraindicated in compartment syndrome because it reduces arterial inflow, further compromising tissue perfusion. Applying a warm compress is also inappropriate as it can increase swelling and exacerbate the condition. Pain that is dull and manageable with repositioning or intermittent and associated with muscle spasms is less indicative of compartment syndrome and warrants further assessment but is not the priority.",

Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent irreversible damage. Assess pain using a standardized pain scale and document its characteristics (e.g., location, intensity, quality). Be vigilant for changes in pain level or characteristics, especially if the pain is disproportionate to the injury or unrelieved by analgesics."

In compartment syndrome, maintaining arterial inflow is paramount, and elevation can impede blood flow to the affected area. Focus on keeping the limb at heart level to optimize perfusion."
