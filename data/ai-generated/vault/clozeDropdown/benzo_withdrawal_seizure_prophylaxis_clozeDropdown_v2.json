    "correct": "Long-acting benzodiazepines are used in benzodiazepine withdrawal to provide a gradual reduction in GABAergic activity, preventing the abrupt neuronal hyperexcitability that leads to withdrawal seizures. By cross-tolerance, the long-acting benzodiazepine can be slowly tapered, allowing the brain to adapt to decreasing levels of GABA. This reduces the risk of seizures, anxiety, and other withdrawal symptoms. This method provides a safer and more controlled withdrawal process, minimizing the potential for severe adverse effects.",
    "incorrect": "Antipsychotics are generally not used for benzodiazepine withdrawal because they can lower the seizure threshold, paradoxically increasing the risk of seizures. SSRIs are used primarily for treating underlying anxiety or depression, but they do not directly address the GABAergic dysregulation that causes benzodiazepine withdrawal seizures. Abruptly blocking dopamine receptors can lead to neurological side effects and is not a mechanism for benzodiazepine withdrawal management. Increasing serotonin reuptake is the mechanism of SSRIs, which do not prevent benzo withdrawal seizures.",

Using long-acting benzodiazepines facilitates a gradual taper, preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. Other medications, such as antipsychotics, may lower the seizure threshold and are generally avoided. Supportive care and monitoring for withdrawal symptoms are essential. The severity of withdrawal depends on the dose, duration of use, and individual patient factors."
