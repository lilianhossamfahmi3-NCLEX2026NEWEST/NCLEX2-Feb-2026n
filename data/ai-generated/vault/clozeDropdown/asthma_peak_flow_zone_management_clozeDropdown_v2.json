    "correct": "A PEF reading of 50% to 79% of the patient's personal best falls within the yellow zone, signifying moderate asthma exacerbation. This indicates airway narrowing and inflammation. Increasing the rescue medication dosage (usually a short-acting beta-agonist) is crucial to quickly dilate the airways, reduce inflammation, and improve airflow. This action aligns with established asthma management guidelines, aiming to prevent progression to a more severe exacerbation that may require hospitalization. Regular monitoring and appropriate medication adjustments are vital for maintaining asthma control and preventing exacerbations.",
    "incorrect": "A PEF reading of 80% to 100% indicates the green zone, meaning asthma is well-controlled. A PEF reading less than 50% indicates the red zone and a severe exacerbation requiring immediate medical attention. Discontinuing all asthma medications is dangerous and can lead to a severe asthma attack, potentially resulting in respiratory failure. Reducing the maintenance medication dosage during a yellow zone reading would worsen asthma control and is contraindicated, as it would further reduce the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects needed to manage the exacerbation.",

        "body": "Peak flow meters measure the speed of air exhaled from the lungs, providing an objective assessment of airway obstruction in asthma. The readings are categorized into zones (green, yellow, and red) based on the patient's personal best PEF. The yellow zone (50-79% of personal best) indicates moderate airway narrowing, requiring increased rescue medication and close monitoring. Failure to recognize and act on yellow zone readings can lead to a progression to the red zone, a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Patient education on proper peak flow meter use and asthma action plan adherence is crucial for effective self-management."
