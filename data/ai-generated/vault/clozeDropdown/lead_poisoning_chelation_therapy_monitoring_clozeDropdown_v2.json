    "correct": "Chelation therapy, particularly with agents like EDTA or succimer, works by binding to lead in the body, facilitating its excretion primarily through the kidneys. This process places a significant burden on the renal system. Monitoring renal function (BUN, creatinine, urine output) is crucial to detect early signs of acute kidney injury resulting from the increased workload and potential nephrotoxic effects of the chelating agent and mobilized lead. Early detection allows for timely intervention, such as adjusting the chelation protocol or providing supportive renal care, to prevent irreversible kidney damage. Renal function is more directly impacted by chelation therapy than hepatic function or blood glucose levels.",

      "Monitoring liver enzymes is important for overall health, but renal function is the priority due to the mechanism of chelation and excretion of lead.",

This process can strain the kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury. Monitoring renal function through serum creatinine, BUN, and urine output is vital to detect early signs of kidney damage. Dosage adjustments, hydration management, and temporary cessation of chelation may be necessary to protect kidney function during treatment. Recognizing and managing this potential complication is essential for safe and effective lead poisoning management."
