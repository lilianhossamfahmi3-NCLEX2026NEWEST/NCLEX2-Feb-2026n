        "correct": "Levodopa absorption is significantly affected by dietary protein. Amino acids from protein compete with levodopa for transport across the intestinal lining and the blood-brain barrier. Administering levodopa separately from food, particularly 30-60 minutes before meals, minimizes this competition, allowing for greater and more consistent absorption of the drug. This leads to more predictable and effective symptom control, reducing 'off' periods and dyskinesias.",
        "incorrect": "Administering levodopa concurrently with or immediately after food intake can significantly impair its absorption due to competition with dietary proteins for transport mechanisms in the gut and across the blood-brain barrier. This results in decreased bioavailability of levodopa, leading to suboptimal symptom control and potential fluctuations in motor function. Taking levodopa immediately following meals delays absorption, which is also detrimental.",

Optimal therapeutic benefit requires administering levodopa on an empty stomach, typically 30-60 minutes before meals. Protein consumption competes with levodopa for transport across the intestinal lining and the blood-brain barrier, reducing the amount of drug available to the brain. Consistent timing and dietary adjustments are essential for managing motor fluctuations and improving the patient's quality of life. Monitoring for 'on-off' phenomenon and dyskinesias is crucial for dose adjustments and dietary modifications."
