        "correct": "High-dose corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, are the cornerstone of acute MS relapse management. These drugs reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune response and decreasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, thereby limiting the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system. A typical course lasts 3-5 days, allowing for a sufficient reduction in inflammation while minimizing the potential for severe side effects associated with prolonged high-dose steroid use. The subsequent taper is crucial to prevent rebound inflammation and adrenal insufficiency.",
        "incorrect": "Muscle relaxants are used to manage spasticity, a common symptom in MS, but they do not address the underlying inflammation driving an acute relapse. Anticonvulsants are used to treat neuropathic pain and seizures, which can occur in MS patients, but they are not indicated for acute relapse management. A 10-14 day course of high-dose steroids would expose the patient to increased risks of side effects such as hyperglycemia, mood changes, and infections. A 1-2 day course may not be sufficient to adequately reduce inflammation and control the relapse.",
