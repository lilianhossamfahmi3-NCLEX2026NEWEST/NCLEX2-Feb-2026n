He presented at 09:30 complaining of severe, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm, rated 8/10. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He took one aspirin at home prior to arrival, approximately 30 minutes before arrival.\n\nHis current vital signs are: BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I is elevated at 1.5 ng/mL. The patient is diaphoretic and anxious. I have placed him on oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min and established IV access. I administered 4mg morphine IV for pain at 10:00.\n\nI am concerned he is having an acute inferior wall MI. I recommend immediate transfer to the cardiac catheterization lab for PCI and starting a heparin drip. Does that sound appropriate?\n\n10:30 Update: Patient reports pain decreased to 4/10 after morphine. BP 95/62 mmHg, HR 105 bpm, SpO2 95% on 2L O2.\n\n10:45 Update: Patient is being prepped for cardiac catheterization. Heparin drip started per protocol.",

Heparin, an anticoagulant, is administered to prevent further thrombus formation by inhibiting clotting factors. Restenosis, the re-narrowing of the treated artery, is a potential complication of PCI, requiring monitoring for signs of ischemia and compromised blood flow. Creatinine level is closely monitored post-PCI to assess for contrast-induced nephropathy, a potential kidney injury caused by the contrast dye used during the procedure. Rapid intervention and continuous monitoring are crucial to prevent further cardiac damage and complications.",
