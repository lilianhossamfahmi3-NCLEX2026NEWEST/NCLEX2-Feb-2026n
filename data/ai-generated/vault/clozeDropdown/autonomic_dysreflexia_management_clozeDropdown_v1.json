    "correct": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a medical emergency characterized by a sudden onset of severe hypertension. In a client with a T6 spinal cord injury and a BP of 210/110, the priority is to reduce the blood pressure quickly to prevent stroke or other complications. (1) Placing the client in a high-Fowler's position (sitting upright) utilizes gravity to lower blood pressure. This is the FIRST action. (2) The most common trigger for AD is a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury, with bladder distention or fecal impaction being the most frequent causes. Addressing the cause is crucial for resolving the episode. Untreated AD can lead to seizures, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.",

If the blood pressure remains elevated after positioning and addressing potential triggers (e.g., bladder distention), then consider administering antihypertensive medications such as hydralazine or nifedipine. Nitropaste is another option but may cause a severe headache."
