Protamine sulfate reverses heparin's effects by binding to heparin, forming a stable complex that inactivates the drug. Monitoring the aPTT is crucial to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation without causing excessive bleeding. Regular assessment for signs of bleeding and appropriate dosage adjustments based on aPTT results are essential for safe heparin administration."
