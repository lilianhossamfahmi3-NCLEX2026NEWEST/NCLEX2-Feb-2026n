Rotating sites helps prevent this. Avoiding the area within 2 inches of the umbilicus is important due to variable absorption rates and increased risk of infection from the natural flora present in the umbilical area. This ensures more consistent insulin delivery and reduces potential complications at the infusion site, optimizing glycemic control.",
        "incorrect": "Lipoatrophy is the loss of subcutaneous fat, which was more common with older insulin formulations. Infection, while possible, is less likely than lipohypertrophy with proper site care and rotation. One inch is too close to the umbilicus and does not provide enough margin to avoid inconsistent absorption. Four inches is farther than generally needed and limits available infusion sites.",

Site rotation is crucial to avoid lipohypertrophy, which can lead to erratic glucose control. Proper site selection, avoiding areas near the umbilicus or scar tissue, is essential. Education should emphasize the importance of site inspection, rotation techniques, and prompt recognition of any site-related issues such as redness, swelling, or hardness. Consistent adherence to these practices supports stable blood glucose levels and overall well-being in children with type 1 diabetes."
