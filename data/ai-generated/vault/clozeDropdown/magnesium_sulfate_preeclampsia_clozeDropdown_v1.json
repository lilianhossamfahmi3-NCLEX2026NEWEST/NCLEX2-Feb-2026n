    "correct": "Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant administered to prevent seizures in clients with preeclampsia. It works by decreasing neuromuscular excitability. A key sign of magnesium toxicity is the loss of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), indicating excessive CNS depression. Other signs include respiratory depression (RR < 12) and decreased level of consciousness. Calcium gluconate is the antidote for magnesium sulfate toxicity; it counteracts the effects of magnesium by restoring normal neuromuscular function. The nurse must have it readily available to administer if toxicity occurs. Failure to recognize and treat magnesium toxicity can lead to respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest.",
    "incorrect": "Hyperactive reflexes are a characteristic of preeclampsia and indicate an increased risk for seizures, the very reason magnesium sulfate is being administered. Increased urine output is generally a positive sign, indicating adequate renal perfusion and magnesium excretion.",
