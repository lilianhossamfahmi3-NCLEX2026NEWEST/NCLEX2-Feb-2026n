    "correct": "Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. (1) Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking and dancing, apply mechanical stress to bones, stimulating osteoblast activity (Wolff's Law). Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation, increasing bone density and strength. (2) Calcium is a crucial mineral for bone structure, providing rigidity and strength. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption in the small intestine. Without adequate vitamin D, the body cannot effectively absorb calcium from the diet, leading to calcium depletion from bones.",
    "incorrect": "Non-weight-bearing exercises like swimming are beneficial for cardiovascular health and joint mobility but do not provide sufficient mechanical stress to stimulate bone formation. High-impact jumping can cause vertebral compression fractures or other injuries in individuals with pre-existing osteoporosis due to weakened bone structure. Iron and vitamin C are important for red blood cell production and immune function, respectively, but do not directly impact bone health. Potassium and B-vitamins play roles in various metabolic processes but are not primary nutrients for bone health.",
