    "correct": "Maintaining airway patency is the immediate priority following a tonic-clonic seizure due to the risk of airway obstruction from decreased level of consciousness and potential tongue displacement. Aspiration is a significant risk as the gag reflex may be suppressed during the post-ictal phase, allowing gastric contents or saliva to enter the lungs, leading to aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ensuring a patent airway and monitoring for aspiration are critical interventions to prevent these life-threatening complications. Immediate intervention should include positioning the patient on their side to facilitate drainage and using suction if necessary to clear secretions.",
    "incorrect": "Blood glucose monitoring is important but not the immediate priority. While hypoglycemia can contribute to seizures, airway and breathing take precedence. Level of orientation can be assessed after ensuring the patient's airway is secure and breathing is adequate. Bradycardia is not a typical post-ictal complication, and while monitoring vital signs is important, airway management is the priority. Hyperglycemia is less likely than hypoglycemia post-seizure and is not the immediate concern; aspiration poses a more immediate threat to the patient's well-being.",

Nursing interventions focus on maintaining a safe environment, ensuring airway patency, monitoring vital signs, and preventing complications such as aspiration. Documenting the duration and characteristics of the seizure and post-ictal phase is crucial for effective management. Continuous assessment and vigilance are essential to promote patient recovery and prevent further injury or complications."
