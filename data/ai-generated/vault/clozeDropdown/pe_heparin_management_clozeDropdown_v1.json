    "correct": "The aPTT is the primary lab used to monitor the therapeutic effect of unfractionated Heparin. Heparin inhibits the formation of fibrin clots by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, which neutralizes thrombin and other clotting factors. The goal of Heparin therapy is to prolong the aPTT to 1.5-2.5 times the control value (typically 60-80 seconds). Bleeding gums and hematuria are signs of excessive anticoagulation, indicating a risk of hemorrhage. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for Heparin and should be readily available in such cases to reverse the effects of the drug and prevent further bleeding complications.",
    "incorrect": "PT/INR is used to monitor Warfarin (Coumadin) therapy, not Heparin. Tachycardia and hypotension can be signs of a worsening pulmonary embolism or internal bleeding, but they are not specific indicators of Heparin toxicity. Sudden chest pain could indicate worsening PE or other cardiac issues, but bleeding is the more specific early sign of Heparin overdose.",
