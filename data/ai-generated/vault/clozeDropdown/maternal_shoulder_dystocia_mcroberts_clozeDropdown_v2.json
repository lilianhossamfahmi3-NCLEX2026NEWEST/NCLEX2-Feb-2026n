        "correct": "The McRoberts maneuver is a first-line intervention for shoulder dystocia, involving hyperflexion of the mother's hips. This action straightens the sacrum and rotates the symphysis pubis cephalad, effectively increasing the anterior-posterior diameter of the pelvic outlet. This increased space allows for the impacted fetal shoulder to dislodge from behind the pubic symphysis, facilitating successful delivery and reducing the risk of fetal injury such as brachial plexus injury or asphyxia.",
        "incorrect": "Rotating the fetal head is a separate maneuver (e.g., Woods' screw maneuver) used in shoulder dystocia, focusing on internal rotation of the fetal shoulders. Compressing the abdomen is contraindicated as it can increase the risk of uterine rupture or fetal injury. Decreasing uterine contractions is not the primary goal of McRoberts maneuver; the focus is on changing the pelvic dimensions. Inducing fetal bradycardia is an adverse event, not a desired outcome of the maneuver; bradycardia is often a sign of fetal distress during a difficult delivery.",

The McRoberts maneuver, along with suprapubic pressure, are first-line interventions. Nurses must be prepared to assist with these maneuvers, document the sequence of events, and monitor for maternal and fetal complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, brachial plexus injuries, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Effective communication and teamwork are crucial in managing this time-sensitive event."
