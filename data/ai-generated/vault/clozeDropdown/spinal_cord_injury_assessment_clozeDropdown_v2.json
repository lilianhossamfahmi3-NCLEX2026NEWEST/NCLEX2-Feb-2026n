While some diaphragmatic function may be preserved, it is often insufficient to maintain adequate ventilation, making respiratory support a possibility. The patient's ability to breathe is compromised, but not entirely absent, necessitating careful monitoring and potential intervention.",
        "incorrect": "Full diaphragm function is incorrect because injuries at C4 disrupt the nerve pathways to the diaphragm, leading to weakened muscle function. No respiratory support is incorrect because, despite some residual function, the patient will likely need assistance to maintain adequate oxygenation. Minimal respiratory support is incorrect as the patient may require significant intervention, including mechanical ventilation, depending on the extent of the injury and individual physiological response.",

The extent of respiratory dysfunction depends on the completeness and level of the injury. Patients may exhibit shallow breathing, reduced tidal volume, and decreased ability to cough effectively. Regular monitoring of respiratory status, including arterial blood gases and pulse oximetry, is crucial. Early intervention, such as supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, may be required to prevent hypoxia and respiratory failure. Proper positioning and airway management are also essential components of care."
