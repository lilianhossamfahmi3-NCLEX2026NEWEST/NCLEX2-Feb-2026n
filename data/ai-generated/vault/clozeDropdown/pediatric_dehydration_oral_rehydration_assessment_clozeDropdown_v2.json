        "correct": "In mild dehydration, the body attempts to conserve fluids, resulting in slightly decreased urine output as the kidneys try to retain water. A slightly prolonged capillary refill time (1-2 seconds) also indicates that the peripheral circulation is still relatively adequate but may be slightly compromised due to decreased circulating volume. The infant remains alert and interactive, although perhaps less playful than usual.",
        "incorrect": "Bounding peripheral pulses are indicative of fluid overload, not dehydration. Sunken fontanelles are more indicative of moderate to severe dehydration. A brisk capillary refill time is normal and not indicative of dehydration. Markedly delayed capillary refill time is a sign of severe dehydration, which is beyond the scenario of mild dehydration being assessed. A capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds suggests significant fluid deficit and impaired perfusion.",

Mild dehydration presents with subtle signs, including slightly decreased urine output, slightly prolonged capillary refill, and normal vital signs. Oral rehydration therapy is the initial treatment of choice for mild to moderate dehydration, using oral rehydration solutions (ORS) to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Frequent assessment of hydration status is crucial to guide ongoing management and prevent progression to more severe dehydration."
