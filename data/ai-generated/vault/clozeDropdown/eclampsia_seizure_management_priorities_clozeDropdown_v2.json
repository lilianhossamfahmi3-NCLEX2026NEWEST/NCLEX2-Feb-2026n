    "correct": "Maintaining airway patency is the immediate priority following a seizure to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent hypoxia. Positioning the patient on her side after the seizure minimizes the risk of aspiration if vomiting occurs. Eclampsia, characterized by seizures in a pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia, requires immediate interventions to protect both the mother and the fetus. The seizure activity can compromise maternal oxygenation, leading to fetal hypoxia. Therefore, establishing and maintaining a patent airway is paramount. Side positioning further safeguards against aspiration, a serious complication that can lead to pneumonia and respiratory distress.",
    "incorrect": "Neurological assessment and fetal heart rate monitoring, while important, are secondary to ensuring the patient's airway is open and she is breathing adequately. Initiating a magnesium sulfate bolus is crucial for preventing further seizures, but does not address the immediate need for airway management after a seizure. Preparing for immediate delivery might be necessary depending on the maternal and fetal status, but securing the airway and preventing aspiration take precedence in the immediate post-seizure period. These interventions address critical, but not the MOST critical, needs immediately following the seizure event.",

Management focuses on stopping the seizures, preventing further seizures, and assessing maternal and fetal well-being. Interventions include magnesium sulfate administration, blood pressure control, and potentially delivery depending on gestational age and maternal/fetal status. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and fetal heart rate is essential. Rapid response and collaboration with obstetric and anesthesia teams are crucial for optimal outcomes."
