        "correct": "Initiating an organ donation referral for patients with a GCS of 5 or less while ventilator dependent is crucial as it indicates severe neurological injury with a high probability of progression to brain death. The GCS scale assesses eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. A score of 5 suggests minimal responsiveness, making the patient a potential candidate for organ donation. Similarly, when a family decides to withdraw life-sustaining support, the patient becomes a potential organ donor. Early referral allows for timely evaluation of the patient's suitability for donation and ensures that the family's wishes are respected during the end-of-life process. The referral is to the organ procurement organization (OPO) who determines suitability. This aligns with ethical principles of autonomy and beneficence.",
        "incorrect": "A GCS of 10 or 13 indicates that the patient has a better level of consciousness and the potential for neurological recovery is higher. Therefore, immediate referral is not indicated at this point. Comfort care is part of the natural dying process and should always be initiated; however, it does not necessarily mean that the patient is a potential organ donor. Palliative care is a holistic approach that focuses on improving the quality of life for patients and their families facing life-limiting illnesses. While palliative care is essential, it does not automatically trigger an organ donation referral, which is specifically indicated when withdrawal of support is being considered.",
