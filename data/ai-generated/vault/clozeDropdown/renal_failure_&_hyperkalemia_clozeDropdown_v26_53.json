      "correct": "Hyperkalemia in acute renal failure requires prompt intervention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. The initial step is to administer intravenous calcium gluconate to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane and prevent arrhythmias. This does not lower the potassium level but protects the heart. Next, administer intravenous regular insulin with dextrose. Insulin drives potassium into the cells, while dextrose prevents hypoglycemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) promotes potassium excretion via the gastrointestinal tract, though it has a slower onset. Intravenous furosemide, a loop diuretic, can help excrete potassium via the kidneys, assuming some residual renal function exists. Finally, if other measures fail or the hyperkalemia is severe, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is indicated to remove potassium directly from the bloodstream.",

He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. **Background:** Mr. Jones has been experiencing decreased urine output and increased serum creatinine levels over the past 3 days. He reports poor oral intake due to nausea. **Assessment:** Current vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 94% on room air. ECG shows peaked T waves. Labs reveal K+ 7.0 mEq/L, Creatinine 4.5 mg/dL, BUN 60 mg/dL. Patient complains of muscle weakness and palpitations. 07:00: Patient reports feeling unwell and nauseous. 07:15: ECG shows worsening peaked T waves. 07:30: Repeat K+ level is 7.2 mEq/L. **Recommendation:** I recommend immediate intervention to address Mr. Jones's hyperkalemia, including calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, and consideration for dialysis or CRRT. Please evaluate and provide orders urgently.",
