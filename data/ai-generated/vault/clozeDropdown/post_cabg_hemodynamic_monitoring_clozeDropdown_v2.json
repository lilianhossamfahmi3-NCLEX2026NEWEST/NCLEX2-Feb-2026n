    "correct": "Cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening complication post-CABG, occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart. This compression impairs ventricular filling, leading to decreased CO and increased CVP. Positive inotropes, such as dobutamine or milrinone, enhance myocardial contractility, increasing CO and improving tissue perfusion. By increasing the force of contraction, the heart is better able to overcome the external pressure from the pericardial effusion. Furthermore, inotropes can have mild vasodilatory effects, which can help reduce preload and CVP. This ultimately aids in restoring hemodynamic stability in the presence of tamponade.",
    "incorrect": "Hypovolemia would result in decreased CVP and CO, the opposite of the scenario presented. Administering a diuretic would worsen hypovolemia. Vasodilation would cause a decrease in CVP and afterload, not an increase in CVP. A vasodilator would further drop blood pressure and compromise tissue perfusion in the setting of suspected cardiac tamponade.",

This compression leads to a decrease in cardiac output (CO) and an increase in central venous pressure (CVP). Recognizing the signs of tamponade early is crucial for prompt intervention. Management includes pericardiocentesis to remove the fluid and positive inotropes to support cardiac function until the underlying cause is addressed. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is essential in post-CABG patients to detect and manage this potentially fatal condition."
