        "correct": "Metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Iodinated contrast dye can transiently worsen renal function, increasing this risk. Discontinuing metformin for 48 hours allows renal function to recover. Post-contrast renal function assessment helps ensure the kidneys are functioning adequately before resuming metformin, minimizing the risk of lactic acidosis. This is particularly crucial because metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, leading to lactate accumulation if renal excretion is compromised.",
        "incorrect": "Withholding metformin for only 24 or 12 hours may not be sufficient for renal function to recover, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, increasing the risk of lactic acidosis. Assessing renal function during or prior to contrast administration does not provide an accurate assessment of the dye's impact on renal function. Assessing post-contrast ensures any acute kidney injury is identified before resuming metformin.",
