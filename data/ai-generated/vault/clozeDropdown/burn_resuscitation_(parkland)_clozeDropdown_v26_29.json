S: Mr. Jones, a 45-year-old male weighing 70 kg, arrived in the ED 30 minutes ago with full-thickness burns covering 40% of his Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) after a house fire. He is alert but anxious, complaining of thirst. A: Patient's airway is patent with audible wheezing. His current vital signs are: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28, SpO2 94% on 10L O2 via facemask. He has significant edema and blistering across his chest, abdomen, and both arms. He received morphine 4mg IV push upon arrival for pain. Initial assessment reveals signs of hypovolemic shock. B: Patient has a history of hypertension, well-controlled with lisinopril. No known allergies. Last oral intake was 08:00 this morning. P: I am concerned about hypovolemic shock and potential for acute kidney injury. I recommend initiating burn resuscitation using the Parkland formula, monitoring urine output hourly, and preparing for possible intubation due to airway compromise from edema.",
