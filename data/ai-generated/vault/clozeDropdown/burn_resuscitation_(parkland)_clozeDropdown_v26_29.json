A: Airway is patent with audible wheezing. Vitals: HR 120 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, RR 28, SpO2 94% on 10L O2 via facemask. Significant edema and blistering across chest, abdomen, and both arms. Morphine 4mg IV given at 13:30 for pain. Initial assessment indicates hypovolemic shock. Labs show Na 132, K 5.1, BUN 25, Creatinine 1.8, Lactate 3.0. B: History of hypertension, controlled with lisinopril. No known allergies. Last oral intake at 08:00. Chest X-ray clear. P: Concerned about hypovolemic shock and potential acute kidney injury. Recommend initiating burn resuscitation per Parkland formula, hourly urine output monitoring, and preparing for possible intubation due to airway edema.",
