    "correct": "The classic triad of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) includes: (1) Hypoxemia (often presenting as dyspnea and decreased SpO2), (2) Neurological decline (ranging from confusion to altered level of consciousness), and (3) Petechial rash (typically on the chest, neck, and axillae due to microvascular damage caused by fat globules).  The pathophysiology involves the release of fat globules from the bone marrow into the bloodstream following a long-bone fracture. These globules travel to the lungs, causing inflammation, capillary damage, and impaired gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia.  Neurological symptoms arise from fat emboli obstructing cerebral blood flow. Petechiae result from fat emboli and associated inflammatory mediators damaging capillaries. The primary goal is supportive care to maintain oxygenation and ventilation until the body clears the fat emboli.  This involves administering high-flow oxygen, potentially intubation and mechanical ventilation, and supportive measures to manage symptoms.",
    "incorrect": "Heparin is an anticoagulant used for thrombus formation, not fat emboli. FES is caused by fat globules, not blood clots, so anticoagulation is not the primary treatment. Surgical removal of fat globules is not feasible due to their widespread distribution and microvascular involvement. Pitting edema is associated with fluid overload or venous insufficiency, not FES. Distended neck veins suggest fluid overload or right-sided heart failure, not FES.",
