    "correct": "Pyloromyotomy is a surgical intervention to correct pyloric stenosis, a condition where the pyloric sphincter thickens, obstructing gastric emptying. (1) Early initiation of small, frequent feedings of formula or breast milk postoperatively helps to re-establish normal gastrointestinal function and assess the infant's tolerance to feeding. This approach minimizes gastric distention and reduces the risk of vomiting. (2) Some degree of vomiting is expected in the initial 24-48 hours after surgery due to edema and inflammation at the surgical site. This does not necessarily indicate surgical failure. The nurse must differentiate between normal post-operative emesis and persistent, projectile vomiting, which would warrant further investigation.",
    "incorrect": "Prolonged NPO status is unnecessary and can delay the return of normal GI function. High-fiber solid foods are developmentally inappropriate for infants in this age group and could exacerbate gastrointestinal distress. Dumping syndrome is associated with gastric bypass surgery, not pyloromyotomy. Hematochezia is not typically associated with pyloromyotomy.",
