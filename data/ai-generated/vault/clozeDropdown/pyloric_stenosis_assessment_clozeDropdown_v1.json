    "correct": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter, obstructing gastric emptying. (1) **Non-bilious, projectile vomiting** occurs because the obstruction is proximal to the bile duct and the stomach forcefully contracts to expel its contents. The absence of bile indicates the blockage is before the duodenum. (2) Palpation may reveal **an olive-shaped mass** in the epigastrium, representing the enlarged pyloric muscle. This mass is most palpable after vomiting when the stomach is empty.",
    "incorrect": "A sausage-shaped mass is characteristic of intussusception, a telescoping of the intestine. Bilious vomiting suggests an obstruction distal to the bile duct, such as in intestinal malrotation. A flat, rigid abdomen may indicate peritonitis or other serious abdominal pathology.",
