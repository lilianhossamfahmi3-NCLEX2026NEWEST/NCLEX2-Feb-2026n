    "correct": "Cerebral vasodilation occurs with rapid correction of acidosis because CO2 rapidly diffuses into the brain, increasing intracellular pH. This vasodilation can increase intracranial pressure, especially in patients with pre-existing neurological compromise. Furthermore, bicarbonate administration raises serum sodium levels, which, in turn, drives potassium intracellularly, leading to hypokalemia. Metabolic alkalosis resulting from excessive bicarbonate can lead to decreased ionized calcium, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological manifestations like tetany or seizures.",
    "incorrect": "Cerebral vasoconstriction is incorrect because rapid correction of acidosis causes cerebral vasodilation due to rapid CO2 diffusion. Pulmonary vasodilation is incorrect because it is not a primary consequence of rapid correction of metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are incorrect because bicarbonate administration increases serum sodium and can shift potassium intracellularly, leading to hypokalemia. Hyperchloremia and hyperkalemia are also incorrect because bicarbonate administration typically does not directly cause hyperchloremia and leads to hypokalemia.",

Bicarbonate replacement should be approached cautiously, particularly in severe cases, to avoid complications such as cerebral vasodilation and electrolyte imbalances. Rapid correction can lead to a shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, impairing oxygen delivery to tissues. Monitoring arterial blood gases and serum electrolytes is essential to guide bicarbonate therapy safely."
