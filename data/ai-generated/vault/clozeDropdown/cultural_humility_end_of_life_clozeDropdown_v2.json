    "correct": "Cultural humility involves a continuous process of self-reflection and critique, recognizing one's own cultural biases and limitations. In end-of-life care, this is crucial because cultural beliefs profoundly shape a patient's understanding and acceptance of death, influencing their preferences for medical interventions, rituals, and communication styles. A culturally humble approach ensures care is patient-centered and respects the individual's values, leading to improved patient and family satisfaction and reduced psychological distress. This includes understanding the role of family, spiritual beliefs, and community support in coping with death and dying.",

It involves self-reflection, recognizing power imbalances, and fostering respectful partnerships with patients and their families. This includes exploring cultural norms related to death rituals, grief, communication styles, and decision-making processes. Failure to address cultural factors can lead to misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, and inappropriate care. Always seek to learn from your patients and collaborate with interdisciplinary team members to provide culturally sensitive support."
