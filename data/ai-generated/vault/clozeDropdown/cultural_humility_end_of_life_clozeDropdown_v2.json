        "correct": "Cultural humility involves a continuous process of self-reflection and critique, recognizing one's own cultural biases and limitations. In end-of-life care, this is crucial because cultural beliefs profoundly shape a patient's understanding and acceptance of death, influencing their preferences for medical interventions, rituals, and communication styles. A culturally humble approach ensures care is patient-centered and respects the individual's values, leading to improved patient and family satisfaction and reduced psychological distress. This includes understanding the role of family, spiritual beliefs, and community support in coping with death and dying.",
        "incorrect": "Cultural imposition is the tendency to impose one's own cultural beliefs, values, and practices on individuals from another culture, which is detrimental in end-of-life care. Cultural competence refers to having knowledge and understanding of different cultures, but without the self-reflection component of cultural humility, it may still lead to generalizations and inadequate care. While insurance coverage and nutritional intake are important aspects of patient care, they are not as directly related to the cultural and emotional experience of death as a patient's overall approach to death.",

Failure to address cultural factors can lead to misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, and inappropriate care. Always seek to learn from your patients and collaborate with interdisciplinary team members to provide culturally sensitive support."
