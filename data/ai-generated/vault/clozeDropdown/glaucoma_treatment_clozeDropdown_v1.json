    "correct": "Glaucoma, specifically POAG, is characterized by a gradual increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to impaired drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. This elevated IOP exerts pressure on the optic nerve, leading to progressive damage and eventual vision loss. (1) POAG is a chronic condition requiring lifelong management with eye drops to lower IOP and prevent further optic nerve damage. (2) Without consistent treatment, the sustained high IOP causes irreversible damage to the retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in progressive peripheral vision loss that can advance to complete blindness. Adherence to the prescribed medication regimen is crucial to preserving vision.",
    "incorrect": "Most types of glaucoma, particularly POAG, are painless in the early stages, often referred to as the 'silent thief of sight.' The primary goal of medication is to lower IOP and prevent further optic nerve damage; it cannot restore vision that has already been lost. Corneal ulceration and retinal detachment are not direct complications of POAG.",
