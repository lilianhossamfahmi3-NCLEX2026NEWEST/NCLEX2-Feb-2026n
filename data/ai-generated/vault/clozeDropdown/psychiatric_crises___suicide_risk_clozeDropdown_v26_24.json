Immediate intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety. A direct communication strategy is crucial for assessing the patient's immediate safety, establishing clear expectations, and providing reassurance. Empathetic communication is important, but direct questioning about suicidal thoughts and plans is paramount in this acute situation. Indirect communication is unlikely to be effective in such a high-risk scenario. Risk factors compound to create a critical situation demanding swift, targeted action.",
