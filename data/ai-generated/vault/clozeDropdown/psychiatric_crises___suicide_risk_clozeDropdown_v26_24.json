Found by his roommate.\n\nBackground: History of PTSD and major depressive disorder, diagnosed 3 years ago. Discharged from military service 6 months ago. Reports difficulty adjusting to civilian life, feelings of isolation, and recurrent suicidal ideation. The patient has been prescribed sertraline 100mg daily but reports inconsistent adherence.\n\nAssessment: Patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but exhibits flat affect and expresses feelings of hopelessness. Reports auditory hallucinations ('voices telling me I'm worthless'). Vital signs stable: BP 120/80, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. Acetaminophen level pending. Exhibiting psychomotor retardation. Denies current suicidal intent but admits to passive suicidal ideation. Poor insight into his mental health condition. Expresses shame and guilt related to military experiences.\n\nRecommendation: Continuous suicide precautions, psychiatric evaluation, medication review (specifically sertraline adherence), initiate individual therapy, social work consult for discharge planning and resource linkage. Monitor acetaminophen levels and liver function. Consider group therapy for veterans. Encourage consistent medication adherence and psychoeducation.",

Immediate intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety and prevent further harm. A direct communication strategy is crucial for assessing the patient's immediate safety, establishing clear expectations, and providing reassurance. While empathetic communication is important, direct questioning about suicidal thoughts and plans is paramount in this acute situation. Indirect communication is unlikely to be effective in such a high-risk scenario. These risk factors compound to create a critical situation demanding swift, targeted action. Addressing medication adherence is also crucial for long-term management.",
