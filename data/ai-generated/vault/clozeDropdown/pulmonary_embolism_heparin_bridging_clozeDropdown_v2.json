        "correct": "Heparin provides immediate anticoagulation, while warfarin takes several days to reach a therapeutic level. Overlapping the two medications is essential to prevent a period of inadequate anticoagulation. Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Initially, the reduction in protein C levels leads to a transient procoagulant effect, increasing the risk of thrombosis. Once the INR is therapeutic (usually between 2 and 3) and sustained for at least 24 hours, heparin can be safely discontinued, as warfarin has achieved its full anticoagulant effect.",
        "incorrect": "Continuing heparin indefinitely is unnecessary once warfarin is therapeutic and increases the risk of bleeding. Reducing the heparin dose by 50% does not provide adequate anticoagulation. Warfarin does not have an immediate anticoagulant effect; it has a procoagulant effect initially due to the quicker depletion of protein C compared to clotting factors. Warfarin is not neutral, it has a well defined, albeit delayed, anticoagulant effect.",

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. Due to warfarin's delayed onset of action and initial procoagulant effect, it is essential to bridge with heparin to provide immediate anticoagulation and prevent thrombosis. The INR must be monitored regularly to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation."
