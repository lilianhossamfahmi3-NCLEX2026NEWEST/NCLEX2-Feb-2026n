Active listening is essential to understanding the patient's values, beliefs, and preferences regarding end-of-life care. These practices promote patient autonomy and dignity by ensuring their cultural and individual needs are respected and met. Failing to address these needs can result in increased suffering and lack of trust in the healthcare system. A culturally humble approach improves patient outcomes by tailoring care to their specific cultural context and preferences, leading to more effective and compassionate end-of-life experiences.",
        "incorrect": "Cultural imposition refers to forcing one's own cultural values onto others, which is harmful in end-of-life care. Cultural competence implies a level of mastery that is often unattainable and can lead to assumptions. Assertive communication, while important in healthcare, is not the primary method for understanding patient preferences in this context; active listening fosters a deeper connection. Passive observation would not allow the nurse to understand the patient's preferences. These actions are inappropriate because they do not involve respectful inquiry and honoring of the patient's background and values, leading to potentially inadequate and insensitive care.",
