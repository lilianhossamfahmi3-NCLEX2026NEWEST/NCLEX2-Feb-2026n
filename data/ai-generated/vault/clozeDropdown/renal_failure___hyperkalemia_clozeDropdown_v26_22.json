Monitoring urine output alone does not address the immediate hyperkalemia. Initiating dialysis is a longer-term solution and not the immediate action. Administering furosemide may help excrete potassium but is not as effective as calcium gluconate in immediately stabilizing the heart.",

He reports muscle weakness and nausea. ECG shows peaked T waves. He received one dose of furosemide 40 mg IV at 16:00. Urine output is minimal since admission. His creatinine is 5.2 mg/dL and BUN is 60 mg/dL. I'm concerned about potential cardiac complications. I recommend administering calcium gluconate immediately to stabilize his heart and then following with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Do you agree with this plan, and would you like any additional orders?",
