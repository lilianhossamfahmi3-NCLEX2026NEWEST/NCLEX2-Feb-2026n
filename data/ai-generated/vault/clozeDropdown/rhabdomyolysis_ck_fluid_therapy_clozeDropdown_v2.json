        "correct": "Maintaining a urine output of 1-2 mL/kg/hour in rhabdomyolysis is critical to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). Myoglobin, released from damaged muscle tissue, precipitates in the renal tubules, causing obstruction and direct toxicity. Adequate fluid therapy with this target urine output helps flush myoglobin and other nephrotoxic substances from the kidneys, reducing the risk of AKI. Hemodialysis is considered when conservative measures fail to reduce CK levels and prevent further renal damage. Hemodialysis directly removes myoglobin and other toxins from the bloodstream, preventing further deposition in the kidneys and mitigating the risk of irreversible renal failure.",
        "incorrect": "A urine output of 0.2-0.5 mL/kg/hour is indicative of oliguria and is insufficient to adequately flush myoglobin from the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of AKI. A urine output of 5-7 mL/kg/hour is excessively high and is not a standard recommendation, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances and volume overload. Administering vasopressors is inappropriate as it constricts blood vessels and reduces renal perfusion, exacerbating the risk of AKI. Administering diuretics may worsen hypovolemia and further compromise renal function, increasing the risk of AKI.",

Myoglobin can cause acute kidney injury by obstructing renal tubules and exerting direct toxicity. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is crucial to maintain adequate renal perfusion and promote myoglobin clearance. Monitoring of serum CK levels, urine output, and renal function is essential to guide treatment and prevent complications. In severe cases, hemodialysis may be required to remove myoglobin and other toxins from the bloodstream."
