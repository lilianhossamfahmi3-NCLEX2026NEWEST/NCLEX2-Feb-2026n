    "correct": "Allograft rejection is the primary concern following kidney transplantation because the recipient's immune system recognizes the donor kidney as foreign and initiates an immune response to destroy it. Immunosuppressant medications are essential to suppress the immune system and prevent this rejection process. Nephrotoxicity is a common side effect of calcineurin inhibitors, frequently used in immunosuppression regimens. These drugs can cause vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, leading to reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Chronic nephrotoxicity can result in long-term kidney damage and graft dysfunction.",
    "incorrect": "Opportunistic infections are a significant risk in immunocompromised patients but are typically a secondary concern compared to preventing acute rejection. Malignancy is a long-term risk associated with chronic immunosuppression, arising from impaired immune surveillance of cancerous cells. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a cause of acute kidney injury but is not a direct consequence of immunosuppressant medications used post-transplant. Hyperkalemia is typically related to impaired kidney function or medications affecting potassium excretion but is not a direct adverse effect of standard immunosuppression regimens.",
