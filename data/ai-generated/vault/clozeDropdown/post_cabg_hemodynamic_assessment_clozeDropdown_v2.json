    "correct": "Cardiac tamponade restricts ventricular filling, leading to decreased cardiac output. The accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac increases intrapericardial pressure, which then elevates right atrial pressure, and consequently, the CVP. This is due to the impaired venous return to the right atrium. Hypovolemia, on the other hand, leads to reduced preload, resulting in a decrease in both cardiac output and CVP. The heart's ability to pump efficiently is compromised due to the reduced circulating blood volume.",
    "incorrect": "Hypovolemia would cause a decrease, not an increase, in CVP. Vasodilation would cause a decrease in blood pressure, but not necessarily an increase in CVP. Hypervolemia would cause an increase in CVP, not a decrease. Increased afterload would primarily affect cardiac output and blood pressure, and might cause an increase in CVP, but not a decrease.",

Cardiac tamponade results from fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, restricting ventricular filling and decreasing cardiac output while increasing CVP. Hypovolemia reduces preload, decreasing both cardiac output and CVP. Early recognition and intervention are essential to improve patient outcomes."
