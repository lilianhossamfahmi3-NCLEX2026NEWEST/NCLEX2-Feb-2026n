        "correct": "Chelation therapy, particularly with agents like EDTA, can be nephrotoxic, necessitating careful monitoring of renal function through serum creatinine and BUN levels. Additionally, chelation can bind to calcium, leading to hypocalcemia. Monitoring serum calcium levels and assessing for signs of hypocalcemia (e.g., muscle cramps, tetany, prolonged QT interval) are crucial to prevent complications. Chelation agents bind to lead but may also bind to other essential minerals, such as calcium. The kidneys are the primary route of excretion for both the chelation agent and the lead it has bound to, making renal function a key concern during treatment.",
        "incorrect": "Monitoring liver enzymes is important in general pediatric care, but it is not the primary concern during chelation therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation agents are primarily cleared through the kidneys, not the liver. While blood glucose monitoring is relevant for some pediatric conditions, it is not directly related to the mechanism of action or adverse effects of chelation therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy does not directly impact potassium levels, making hyperkalemia less likely than hypocalcemia. Hyperglycemia is not a common side effect of chelation therapy.",

Chelation agents bind to lead in the bloodstream, facilitating its excretion. However, these agents can also bind to other essential minerals like calcium and can be nephrotoxic. Therefore, close monitoring of renal function and calcium levels is essential during chelation therapy. Baseline renal function tests (BUN, creatinine) and serum calcium levels should be obtained prior to initiation of chelation. Regular monitoring during treatment helps to prevent and manage potential complications, optimizing patient safety and outcomes."
