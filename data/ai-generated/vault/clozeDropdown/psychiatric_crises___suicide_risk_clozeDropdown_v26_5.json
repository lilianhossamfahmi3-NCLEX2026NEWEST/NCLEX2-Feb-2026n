            "correct": "A blunted affect, characterized by a significant reduction in the intensity of emotional expression, is a common indicator of underlying psychiatric distress, especially depression or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Disorganized thought processes, manifested by illogical connections between thoughts and difficulty maintaining a coherent train of thought, suggest a disturbance in cognitive functioning often seen in acute psychotic episodes or severe mood disorders. Assessing for suicidal ideation is the priority nursing intervention because it directly addresses the immediate risk of self-harm. Patients presenting with blunted affect and disorganized thoughts may be at an elevated risk for suicide, necessitating a thorough evaluation of their thoughts, plans, and intent. It is crucial to determine the severity and immediacy of the risk to ensure appropriate interventions are implemented promptly.",
            "incorrect": "Incorrect answers may reflect a misunderstanding of the patient's immediate needs and the significance of the presenting symptoms. For example, administering PRN antipsychotic medication might be considered for disorganized thoughts, but it does not address the immediate risk of suicide. Similarly, obtaining a urine drug screen or initiating a social worker consult are important but secondary to assessing the patient's suicidal ideation.",
