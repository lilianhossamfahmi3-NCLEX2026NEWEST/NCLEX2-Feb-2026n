Disorganized thought processes, manifested by illogical connections between thoughts and difficulty maintaining a coherent train of thought, suggest a disturbance in cognitive functioning often seen in acute psychotic episodes or severe mood disorders. Assessing for suicidal ideation is the priority nursing intervention because it directly addresses the immediate risk of self-harm. Patients presenting with blunted affect and disorganized thoughts may be at an elevated risk for suicide, necessitating a thorough evaluation of their thoughts, plans, and intent.",
