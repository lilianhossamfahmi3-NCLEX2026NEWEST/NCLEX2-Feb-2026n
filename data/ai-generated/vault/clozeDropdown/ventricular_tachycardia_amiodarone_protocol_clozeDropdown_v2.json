This is followed by a maintenance infusion of 1 mg/min for 6 hours, subsequently reduced to 0.5 mg/min. Amiodarone's mechanism involves blocking potassium, sodium, and calcium channels, as well as adrenergic receptors, prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial and ventricular tissues. This action slows conduction and reduces the automaticity of ectopic pacemakers, thus suppressing ventricular arrhythmias. The loading dose is crucial for rapidly achieving therapeutic plasma concentrations to stabilize the arrhythmia.",
        "incorrect": "An initial dose of 75 mg is too low to effectively terminate or control ventricular tachycardia. While some effect may be observed, it is unlikely to be sufficient and can delay appropriate treatment and potentially lead to deterioration of the patient's condition. A bolus infusion is an incorrect description of the subsequent infusion rate, as it is a continuous infusion. A 'rescue' infusion is also incorrect, as it is not a standard term used in the amiodarone protocol, and the terminology does not accurately reflect the continuous nature of the infusion after the bolus.",

Understanding the correct dosing and administration is essential for effective management and prevention of adverse effects. Monitor for signs of hypotension and prolonged QT interval. Always consider the patient's overall clinical condition and comorbidities when managing VT."
