Absent breath sounds on the right. Percussion reveals hyperresonance on the right. New onset jugular venous distension noted. 12-Lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia, no acute ST changes. A: Most likely tension pneumothorax secondary to central line insertion. Hypoxia and hypotension are worsening rapidly. R: STAT chest x-ray. Prepare for immediate needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube insertion. Notify attending physician STAT. Anticipate possible vasopressor support. Monitor vital signs closely.",

            "correct": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition where air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. This increased pressure causes compression of the mediastinal structures, including the trachea and heart, leading to tracheal deviation away from the affected side. The affected side will have absent breath sounds due to lung collapse. The patient also develops hypotension and tachycardia due to decreased venous return to the heart secondary to compression of the vena cava. Jugular venous distension (JVD) occurs due to impaired right atrial filling. Prompt recognition and intervention with needle thoracostomy and chest tube insertion are crucial to decompress the pleural space and restore normal cardiac output and ventilation. The sudden onset of symptoms following central line insertion strongly suggests iatrogenic pneumothorax.",
