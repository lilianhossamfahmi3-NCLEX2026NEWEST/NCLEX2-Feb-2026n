Scheduled for discharge today.\n**Background:** History of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (poorly controlled), and chronic heart failure (HF) NYHA Class III. Lives alone, reports difficulty managing medications and diet. Last Echo showed EF 35%.\n**Assessment:** Currently, vital signs are stable: BP 128/76 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air.
