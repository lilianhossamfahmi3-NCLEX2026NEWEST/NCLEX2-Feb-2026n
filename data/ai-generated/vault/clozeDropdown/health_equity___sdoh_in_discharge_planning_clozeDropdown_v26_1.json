He responded well to IV diuretics and oxygen therapy and is scheduled for discharge today.\n**Background:** Mr. Jones has a history of hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, and chronic heart failure (HF) NYHA Class III. He lives alone and reports difficulty managing his medications and diet. His last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35%.\n**Assessment:** Currently, Mr. Jones's vital signs are stable: BP 128/76 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 96% on room air. His lung sounds are clear, and he has minimal edema. He understands the discharge instructions but expresses concerns about affording medications and transportation to follow-up appointments. He stated, 'I don't know how I'm gonna get to the doctor, and I can barely afford food, let alone more pills.'\n**Recommendation:** Mr. Jones needs assistance with medication reconciliation, reinforcement of dietary education, and connection to community resources for transportation and financial assistance for medications. Consider a home health referral to monitor adherence and assess his home environment. Schedule a follow-up appointment with cardiology within 7 days. Address social determinants of health concerns.",
