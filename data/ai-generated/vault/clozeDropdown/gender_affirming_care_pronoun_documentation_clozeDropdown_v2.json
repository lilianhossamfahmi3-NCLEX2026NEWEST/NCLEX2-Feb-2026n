Using the correct pronouns validates the patient's identity, fosters trust, and improves the therapeutic relationship. Failing to document and utilize correct pronouns can lead to misgendering, which can cause significant psychological distress, feelings of invalidation, and reluctance to seek further medical care.

Focusing on legal name instead of preferred pronouns ignores the patient's affirmed gender and can contribute to feelings of dysphoria and alienation.",
