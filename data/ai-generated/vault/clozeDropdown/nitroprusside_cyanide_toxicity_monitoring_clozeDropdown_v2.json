        "correct": "Nitroprusside is metabolized into cyanide, which is further metabolized into thiocyanate by the liver. Monitoring thiocyanate levels is essential because thiocyanate is renally excreted, and its accumulation can lead to toxicity, especially in patients with renal impairment. Metabolic acidosis, indicated by an increased anion gap, occurs due to the inhibition of cellular respiration by cyanide, leading to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production. This ultimately causes a decrease in blood pH and an increase in the anion gap.",
        "incorrect": "Monitoring serum creatinine is important for renal function but does not directly indicate cyanide toxicity. Potassium levels are related to electrolyte imbalances but are not a primary indicator of cyanide toxicity. Bradypnea is a sign of respiratory depression, which is not directly related to cyanide toxicity, though respiratory changes can occur. Hypertension is the opposite of the desired effect of nitroprusside and is not a sign of cyanide toxicity.",
