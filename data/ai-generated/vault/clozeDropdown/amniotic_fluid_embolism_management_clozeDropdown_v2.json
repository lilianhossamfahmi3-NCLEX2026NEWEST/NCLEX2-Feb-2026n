        "correct": "Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is paramount in AFE due to the abrupt onset of cardiorespiratory collapse. AFE causes a sudden obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to acute right ventricular failure and severe hypoxemia. CPR provides crucial circulatory and respiratory support until definitive interventions can be implemented. Cryoprecipitate is administered to address the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that often accompanies AFE. Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and factor XIII, which are essential for clot formation and stabilization, counteracting the consumptive coagulopathy characteristic of DIC.",
        "incorrect": "Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in AFE as it can exacerbate respiratory compromise and increase intracranial pressure. Emergency cesarean section might be considered if the patient is pregnant and viable, but it is not the immediate priority; stabilizing the mother is crucial first. Calcium gluconate is used to treat hypermagnesemia or hypocalcemia, which are not primary concerns in AFE. Magnesium sulfate is primarily used to prevent seizures in pre-eclampsia or tocolysis, not to manage the coagulopathy associated with AFE.",

Management focuses on immediate cardiopulmonary support, correction of hypoxemia and hypotension, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Early recognition and rapid intervention are essential to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. Key interventions include CPR, oxygenation, blood product transfusion, and consideration of emergency delivery if the patient is viable."
