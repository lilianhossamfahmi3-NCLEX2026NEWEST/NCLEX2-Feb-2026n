    "correct": "Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants low in the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervical os. This placement predisposes the client to painless, bright red vaginal bleeding, especially in the third trimester as the lower uterine segment thins and contracts. A digital vaginal examination is contraindicated because it can disrupt the placenta, leading to severe maternal and fetal hemorrhage. Diagnosis is confirmed via ultrasound to visualize placental placement.",
    "incorrect": "Abruptio placentae typically presents with painful, dark red vaginal bleeding and a rigid abdomen due to uterine contractions and blood accumulation between the placenta and uterine wall. Preterm labor is characterized by regular uterine contractions and cervical changes. External fetal monitoring is a safe and essential assessment tool to evaluate fetal well-being. Abdominal palpation (Leopold maneuvers) can be performed gently to assess fetal position but should be avoided if it causes pain or exacerbates bleeding.",
