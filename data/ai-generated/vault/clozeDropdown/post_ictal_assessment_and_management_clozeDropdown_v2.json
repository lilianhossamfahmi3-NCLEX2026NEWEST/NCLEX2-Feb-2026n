    "correct": "Maintaining airway patency is the paramount concern immediately following a seizure due to the risk of aspiration or hypoxia. During the post-ictal phase, the patient's level of consciousness may be decreased, compromising their ability to protect their airway. Assessing for altered mental status is crucial to monitor the patient's neurological recovery from the seizure. Confusion, disorientation, and drowsiness are common manifestations of post-ictal dysfunction, reflecting the transient disruption of neuronal activity and cerebral metabolism. These assessments guide interventions to support the patient's recovery and prevent complications.",
    "incorrect": "Checking blood glucose is not the immediate priority post-seizure, although it is relevant in the overall assessment. Low blood sugar can cause seizures, but ensuring the patient's airway is clear takes precedence. Assessing bowel sounds is irrelevant to the immediate post-ictal period as it does not provide critical information about the patient’s neurological status or risk for immediate complications. Elevated blood pressure is not a hallmark of the post-ictal state and focusing on it would divert attention from the more critical needs of airway management and neurological assessment.",
