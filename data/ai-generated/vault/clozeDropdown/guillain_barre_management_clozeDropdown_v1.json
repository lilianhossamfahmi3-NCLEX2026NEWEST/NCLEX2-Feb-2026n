    "correct": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy affecting the peripheral nervous system. The pathophysiology involves an autoimmune response, often triggered by a preceding infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni), where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. This demyelination disrupts nerve impulse transmission, leading to ascending paralysis. The most life-threatening complication is respiratory failure due to paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Therefore, continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, depth, and vital capacity is paramount to detect early signs of respiratory compromise and intervene promptly.",
    "incorrect": "Descending paralysis, starting in the face, is more characteristic of conditions like Botulism or Myasthenia Gravis, which affect cranial nerves and neuromuscular junctions differently than GBS. Unilateral weakness is typically indicative of a central nervous system event, such as a stroke, affecting motor pathways in the brain. While cranial nerve function and peripheral pulse quality are important assessments, they are secondary to the immediate threat of respiratory failure in GBS.",
