    "correct": "Applying suction only during withdrawal of the catheter minimizes contact time between the suction force and the delicate tracheal mucosa, reducing the risk of injury, irritation, and inflammation. Limiting suction duration to 10-15 seconds prevents prolonged oxygen desaturation and reduces the likelihood of vagal stimulation, which can lead to bradycardia and hypotension. Prolonged suctioning also increases the risk of atelectasis by removing excessive air from the airways, disrupting alveolar pressure and surfactant function.",
    "incorrect": "Applying suction during insertion increases the risk of trauma to the tracheal mucosa, potentially causing bleeding and discomfort. Suctioning for 20-25 or 30-35 seconds significantly increases the risk of hypoxemia, vagal stimulation, and mucosal damage due to prolonged removal of oxygen and direct irritation of the tracheal lining. Excessive suction duration can lead to a rapid decrease in arterial oxygen saturation, causing adverse cardiovascular effects and potentially compromising patient safety. Furthermore, prolonged suctioning may contribute to airway edema and increased mucus production.",

        "body": "Tracheostomy suctioning is a critical intervention for maintaining airway patency in patients with tracheostomies. Proper technique involves using sterile equipment, preoxygenating the patient, and applying suction only during withdrawal of the catheter for a limited duration (10-15 seconds). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and heart rate is essential to detect and manage potential complications such as hypoxemia and vagal stimulation. Regular assessment of the patient's respiratory status and secretion characteristics guides the frequency and necessity of suctioning interventions, ensuring optimal respiratory support and minimizing adverse effects."
