        "correct": "Heparin and warfarin are often given together initially when starting warfarin therapy. Heparin provides immediate anticoagulation while warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. Once the INR is within the therapeutic range (usually 2-3) for at least 24 hours, the heparin can be discontinued. Overlap is critical to prevent a prothrombotic state during warfarin initiation.",
        "incorrect": "Discontinuing heparin before the INR is therapeutic leaves the patient at risk for clot extension or new clot formation. Monitoring aPTT is crucial for heparin, not warfarin. Continuing both medications indefinitely increases the risk of bleeding. Initiating protamine sulfate is only warranted in cases of heparin overdose or severe bleeding, and would be inappropriate without justification.",

The aPTT is 60 seconds. She denies any active bleeding. 1415: Patient reports mild discomfort in her affected leg. Vital signs stable: BP 130/80, HR 82, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air. No new neurological deficits noted. 1430: I'm concerned her INR is not yet therapeutic despite several days of warfarin.
