        "correct": "During the acute phase of Kawasaki disease, high-dose aspirin is administered to reduce inflammation, specifically targeting the inflammatory cascade that leads to coronary artery inflammation and the subsequent risk of thrombosis. High-dose aspirin acts as an anti-inflammatory agent at these concentrations. Once the acute inflammatory phase subsides (patient afebrile for 48-72 hours or approximately 14 days after symptom onset), the treatment transitions to low-dose aspirin. Low-dose aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly acetylating cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which reduces the production of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor. This prevents the formation of thrombi within potentially damaged coronary arteries, reducing the risk of coronary artery aneurysms.",
        "incorrect": "Bradycardia and hypotension are not direct consequences that high-dose aspirin aims to prevent in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease; while cardiovascular monitoring is important, the primary concern is thrombosis. High-dose aspirin is not continued long-term due to the increased risk of bleeding and other side effects; the goal is to transition to low-dose aspirin to maintain antiplatelet effects without the anti-inflammatory risks associated with high doses. Intermediate-dose aspirin is not a standard phase in the treatment protocol for Kawasaki disease; the established protocol involves a transition from high-dose to low-dose aspirin.",

Monitoring for cardiac complications, such as coronary artery aneurysms, is essential throughout the course of the disease. Discontinuation of low-dose aspirin should be guided by cardiology follow-up and resolution of coronary artery abnormalities."
