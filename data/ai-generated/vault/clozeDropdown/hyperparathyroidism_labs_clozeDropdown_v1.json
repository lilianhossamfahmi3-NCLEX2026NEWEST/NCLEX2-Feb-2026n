        "correct": "In hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands secrete excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH's primary function is to regulate calcium levels in the blood. It achieves this by stimulating the release of calcium from bone (bone resorption), increasing calcium absorption in the intestines (via activation of vitamin D), and increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. Consequently, excessive PTH leads to hypercalcemia. The increased serum calcium then suppresses the renal reabsorption of phosphate, leading to increased phosphate excretion in the urine and resulting in hypophosphatemia. Calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship, largely mediated by PTH's effects on renal handling of these electrolytes.",
        "incorrect": "High phosphorus and low calcium are characteristic of Hypoparathyroidism or Renal Failure. In hypoparathyroidism, insufficient PTH leads to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. In renal failure, the kidneys' ability to excrete phosphate is impaired, leading to hyperphosphatemia, which in turn can suppress calcium levels.",

Client reports no recent changes in medication or diet. EKG shows shortened QT interval.\nRecommendation: Notify provider of lab results and EKG findings. Anticipate orders for further diagnostic testing, such as PTH level and bone density scan. Implement safety precautions to prevent falls. Encourage fluid intake and monitor urine output. Consider administering calcimimetics as prescribed."
