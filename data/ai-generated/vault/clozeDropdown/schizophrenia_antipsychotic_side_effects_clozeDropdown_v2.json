    "correct": "First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) primarily block dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway, leading to a higher incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower affinity for D2 receptors and a higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. However, SGAs are associated with a significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome due to their effects on histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2C), and alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to weight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",
    "incorrect": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic medications characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction, though it's not particularly more associated with first-generation over second-generation. Agranulocytosis, a severe reduction in white blood cells, is primarily associated with clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, and not a typical side effect of first-generation antipsychotics. Tardive dyskinesia is a late-onset EPS that can occur with both first- and second-generation antipsychotics, but is generally considered more linked to long-term dopamine receptor blockade. Akathisia, while an EPS, is also not particularly more associated with second-generation antipsychotics.",

First-generation antipsychotics primarily block dopamine D2 receptors, leading to a higher risk of EPS. Second-generation antipsychotics have a lower affinity for D2 receptors and a higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, resulting in a lower risk of EPS but a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. Monitoring for and managing these side effects are crucial for patient adherence and overall treatment success. Clozapine is an SGA that carries a risk for agranulocytosis and requires regular blood monitoring."
