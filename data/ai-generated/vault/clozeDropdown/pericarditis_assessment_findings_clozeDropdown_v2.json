        "correct": "A pericardial friction rub is a hallmark finding in pericarditis, resulting from the inflamed pericardial layers rubbing against each other during cardiac cycles. The inflammation causes the normally smooth pericardial surfaces to become roughened, creating the characteristic sound. This sound is best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope, with the patient leaning forward. The scratchy, high-pitched quality of the rub is due to the grating movement of the inflamed pericardial layers.",
