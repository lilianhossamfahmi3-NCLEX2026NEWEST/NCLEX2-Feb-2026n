        "correct": "Red man syndrome is caused by the non-immunologic release of histamine from mast cells and basophils due to vancomycin administration, particularly when infused rapidly. Pre-treatment with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine can help block histamine receptors, reducing the severity of the reaction. Hypotension is a common manifestation of histamine release, as histamine causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to a drop in blood pressure. Slowing the infusion rate helps to minimize the rapid histamine release.",
        "incorrect": "Beta-blockers are used for conditions like hypertension and arrhythmias and do not directly address histamine-mediated reactions. Proton-pump inhibitors reduce stomach acid production and are irrelevant to red man syndrome. Hypertension and hyperglycemia are not typical manifestations of red man syndrome; hypotension is more characteristic due to vasodilation caused by histamine release. Hypertension could occur as a compensatory mechanism, but the primary concern is hypotension.",

Monitoring vital signs, particularly blood pressure, and observing for skin changes during and after the infusion are crucial. Severe cases may require intervention with intravenous fluids and antihistamines."
