    "correct": "In SIADH, excessive antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion leads to increased water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in dilutional hyponatremia (low serum sodium) as the retained water dilutes the blood. Simultaneously, the kidneys excrete a small volume of highly concentrated urine, leading to an increased urine specific gravity. The pathophysiology involves the continued release of ADH despite normal or low serum osmolality, disrupting the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate fluid balance. This can be triggered by various factors, including tumors, central nervous system disorders, and certain medications.",
    "incorrect": "Hypernatremia (high serum sodium) and dilute urine are characteristic of Diabetes Insipidus (DI), a condition where there is insufficient ADH, leading to excessive water loss. In DI, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine and subsequent dehydration, leading to hypernatremia.",

Where does that water go? Into the bloodstream, diluting the sodium. The urine becomes concentrated because the water is being reabsorbed."
