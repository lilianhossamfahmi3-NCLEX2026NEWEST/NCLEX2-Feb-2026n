        "correct": "Adequate sedation is crucial during prone positioning to prevent patient agitation and self-extubation, which can exacerbate respiratory distress. Monitoring for desaturation is essential as prone positioning can initially worsen oxygenation in some patients due to changes in pulmonary blood flow and ventilation-perfusion matching. However, over time, prone positioning typically improves oxygenation by recruiting dorsal lung regions and reducing compression of the lungs by the heart and abdomen. The nurse must be vigilant in assessing the patient's respiratory status and be prepared to adjust ventilator settings or reposition the patient if desaturation occurs.",
        "incorrect": "Hydration status, while important overall, is not the immediate priority when initiating prone positioning. While significant hypotension could be problematic, hypertension is much less likely and less immediately dangerous. Bradycardia is not typically associated with prone positioning but desaturation from ventilation-perfusion mismatch is. Feeding is not the priority when initiating prone positioning for a patient with ARDS; the priority is to optimize respiratory function and minimize complications associated with the procedure.",

It is essential to maintain adequate sedation and analgesia to prevent patient discomfort and agitation during the procedure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters, including oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, and arterial blood gases, is crucial to assess the effectiveness of prone positioning and make necessary adjustments to ventilator settings. Vigilance for potential complications, such as pressure ulcers, line dislodgement, and hemodynamic instability, is paramount to ensure patient safety during prone therapy."
