The accumulation of bradykinin can cause a persistent dry cough. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium and water retention and potassium excretion.

No signs of angioedema are present.\nRecommendation: Monitor for persistent dry cough and assess serum potassium levels before administering the next dose of Enalapril. Report any signs of hyperkalemia (muscle weakness, arrhythmias) to the provider immediately. Educate the client on potential side effects and the importance of follow-up lab work. If hyperkalemia is present, consider holding the dose and contacting the provider at 0800 to discuss further management."
