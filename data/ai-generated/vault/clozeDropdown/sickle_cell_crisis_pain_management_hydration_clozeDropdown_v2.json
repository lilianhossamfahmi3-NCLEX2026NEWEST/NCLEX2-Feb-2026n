    "correct": "Decreasing blood viscosity is paramount in sickle cell crisis. Adequate hydration dilutes the concentration of sickled cells, improving blood flow through narrowed vessels and reducing the risk of further vaso-occlusion. This enhanced flow also facilitates oxygen delivery to tissues, preventing ischemia and subsequent pain. Adherence to endothelial cells, a major contributor to vaso-occlusion, is reduced by improved cellular deformability resulting from hydration and decreased concentration of adhesive molecules on the endothelial surface and sickled erythrocytes. The overall effect is a reduction in pain and tissue damage.",
    "incorrect": "Increasing oxygen demand would exacerbate the crisis by placing additional stress on already compromised tissues. Promoting further sickling would worsen the vaso-occlusion and increase pain. While platelet aggregation may contribute to some vaso-occlusive events, endothelial adherence of sickled cells is the primary mechanism. Neutrophil count, while important for infection monitoring, does not directly address the acute pain and vaso-occlusion central to the crisis.",

This reduces sickled cell adherence to the endothelium, preventing further occlusion. Pain management with analgesics is also critical.

Patient education on early recognition of crisis symptoms and adherence to chronic therapies is essential for preventing future crises."
