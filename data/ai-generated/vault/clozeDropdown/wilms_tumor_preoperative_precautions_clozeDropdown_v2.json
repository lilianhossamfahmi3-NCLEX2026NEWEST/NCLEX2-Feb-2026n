  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Preoperative palpation of the abdomen is strictly avoided in children with Wilms tumor because it poses a significant risk of rupturing the tumor capsule. Wilms tumor, a nephroblastoma, is highly vascular and friable. Palpation can cause tumor cells to disseminate within the abdominal cavity, leading to metastasis and complicating subsequent treatment. Monitoring blood pressure is essential because Wilms tumor can secrete renin, leading to hypertension. Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and can affect surgical outcomes. Prompt identification and management of hypertension are crucial in the preoperative period to optimize the child's condition for surgery.",
    "incorrect": "Auscultation of the abdomen does not pose a risk of tumor rupture and is a routine part of abdominal assessment. Percussion, while involving some physical contact, is less likely to cause tumor rupture compared to deep palpation. Monitoring appetite is important for nutritional assessment but is not directly related to the immediate risks associated with Wilms tumor before surgery. Temperature monitoring is important for detecting infections, but blood pressure monitoring is more directly related to the potential complications of Wilms tumor due to renin secretion.",

Palpation of the abdomen is strictly contraindicated due to the risk of seeding tumor cells. Blood pressure monitoring is crucial due to the potential for renin secretion, leading to hypertension. Surgical resection is the primary treatment, often followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, depending on the stage and histology of the tumor. Nursing care includes educating the family about the disease, treatment plan, and potential side effects."
