        "correct": "Initiating airborne precautions immediately is crucial to prevent the spread of TB. This involves placing the client in a negative-pressure room and ensuring all healthcare personnel wear properly fitted N95 respirators. After airborne precautions are in place, the next step is to obtain sputum specimens for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smears and cultures to confirm the diagnosis of active TB. These actions protect both staff and other patients.",
        "incorrect": "Delaying airborne precautions could result in exposure to TB for others. Obtaining a chest x-ray, while important for diagnosis, does not take precedence over infection control measures. Administering antitubercular medications is premature before confirming the diagnosis. Monitoring oxygen saturation is a routine assessment but doesn't directly address the immediate risk of TB transmission.",
