Key signs include autonomic instability (e.g., diaphoresis, tachycardia), neuromuscular hyperactivity (e.g., tremors, twitching, hyperreflexia), and altered mental status. St. John's Wort increases serotonin levels and significantly elevates the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs.",
