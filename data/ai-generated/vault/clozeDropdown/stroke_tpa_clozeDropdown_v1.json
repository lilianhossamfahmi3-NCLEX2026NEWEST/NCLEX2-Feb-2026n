    "correct": "A non-contrast CT scan is crucial to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before administering tPA. tPA is a thrombolytic agent, and administering it in the presence of a hemorrhage can lead to catastrophic bleeding and neurological deterioration. The standard window for IV tPA (Alteplase) is 3 hours from the last known normal (LKN) time, extended to 4.5 hours in carefully selected patients who meet specific criteria (e.g., NIHSS score, no major exclusion criteria). This timeframe is critical because the earlier tPA is administered, the greater the chance of reversing the ischemic process and minimizing permanent brain damage. After 4.5 hours, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage outweighs the potential benefits.",
