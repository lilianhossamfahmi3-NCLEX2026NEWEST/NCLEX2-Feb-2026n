      "correct": "Concurrent administration of heparin and warfarin requires vigilant monitoring. Heparin's effects are measured by PTT, while warfarin's are measured by INR. Warfarin typically takes several days to achieve therapeutic levels, so heparin provides immediate anticoagulation during this period. An INR of 5.5 indicates supratherapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, placing the patient at high risk for bleeding. Therefore, the nurse should withhold the scheduled dose of warfarin and notify the physician immediately. Vitamin K is the antidote for warfarin and may be prescribed to reverse its effects in cases of excessive anticoagulation. Monitoring INR is crucial to assess the ongoing effect of warfarin and guide dosage adjustments.",
