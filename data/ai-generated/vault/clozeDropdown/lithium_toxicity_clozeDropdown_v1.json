  "rationale": {
    "correct": "Lithium, a mood stabilizer, is a salt and competes with sodium in the kidneys. Maintaining consistent sodium and fluid intake is crucial for stable lithium levels. When sodium levels are low (e.g., due to dehydration, low-sodium diet), the kidneys compensate by reabsorbing more lithium, leading to increased serum lithium levels and potential toxicity. Coarse hand tremors and diarrhea are early signs of lithium toxicity, indicating serum levels are exceeding the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). Prompt intervention is needed to prevent severe complications.",
    "incorrect": "Mild thirst and polyuria are common side effects of lithium due to its interference with ADH, but they are not necessarily indicative of toxicity. While these symptoms should be monitored, they are not as urgent as coarse tremors and diarrhea. Potassium and Vitamin K are not directly related to lithium metabolism or toxicity.",
