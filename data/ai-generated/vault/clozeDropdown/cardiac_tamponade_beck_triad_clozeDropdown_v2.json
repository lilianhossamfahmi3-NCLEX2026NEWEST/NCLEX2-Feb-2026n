        "correct": "Muffled heart sounds occur because fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac dampens the transmission of heart sounds. Pulsus paradoxus, an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration, occurs due to the heart's restricted ability to fill and the increased venous return during inspiration further compromising cardiac output. The increased intrapericardial pressure restricts ventricular filling, leading to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output, exacerbating pulsus paradoxus.",
        "incorrect": "Loud heart murmurs are typically associated with valvular heart disease, not cardiac tamponade. Bounding peripheral pulses are inconsistent with the decreased cardiac output seen in tamponade. Kussmaul's sign (increase in JVP with inspiration) is more commonly associated with constrictive pericarditis or right ventricular failure. Absent P waves suggest atrial fibrillation or other atrial arrhythmias, not directly linked to the pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade.",

Prompt diagnosis via echocardiography and treatment with pericardiocentesis are essential to relieve the pressure on the heart and restore cardiac function. The underlying cause of the tamponade must also be addressed."
