    "correct": "A lithium level of 2.0 mEq/L represents severe toxicity. Lithium, a mood stabilizer, affects neuronal signal transduction by influencing various neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Severe toxicity at this level disrupts normal cellular function, leading to neurological, cardiovascular, and renal complications. Levels in this range can cause seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and irreversible kidney damage due to lithium's interference with sodium transport in renal tubules, hence requiring immediate intervention. Moderate to severe toxicity (1.5-2.0 mEq/L) involves pronounced gastrointestinal distress, worsening tremors, confusion, and incoordination, stemming from lithium's impact on neuronal excitability and cellular electrolyte balance.",
    "incorrect": "Mild toxicity (Blank 1) occurs at levels slightly above the therapeutic range, typically around 1.5 mEq/L, and presents with less severe symptoms. Therapeutic range (Blank 1) generally refers to levels between 0.6-1.2 mEq/L, where lithium is effective without causing significant adverse effects. Therapeutic maintenance (Blank 2) is within the normal target range. No toxicity (Blank 2) is incorrect, as levels between 1.5 and 2.0 mEq/L clearly indicate toxicity requiring dosage adjustment and monitoring.",

Factors such as dehydration, impaired renal function, and drug interactions can increase the risk of toxicity. Early recognition of symptoms, such as tremors, confusion, and gastrointestinal distress, is critical for prompt intervention. Management involves immediate discontinuation of lithium, supportive care, and, in severe cases, hemodialysis to remove lithium from the body. Regular monitoring of lithium levels and renal function is essential for preventing toxicity."
