        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed after a supratentorial craniotomy facilitates venous outflow from the brain. This reduces cerebral blood volume, which, in turn, helps to lower intracranial pressure (ICP). Improved venous drainage minimizes the risk of cerebral edema and subsequent complications. Maintaining the head elevation within the specified range (30-45 degrees) optimizes venous return without compromising cerebral perfusion pressure. This positioning also aids in preventing complications like hematoma formation and wound dehiscence. Proper positioning is a critical component of postoperative management to ensure optimal neurological recovery.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect option selections reflect misunderstandings of the physiological effects of positioning after supratentorial craniotomy. 'Arterial inflow' is incorrect because elevating the head primarily affects venous drainage, not arterial supply. 'CSF leakage' is incorrect because while positioning can affect CSF dynamics, it is not the primary goal in this context. 'Blood pressure' is incorrect because while positioning can influence blood pressure, the primary concern post-craniotomy is managing ICP. 'Cerebral perfusion' is incorrect because excessively high elevation can reduce cerebral perfusion; however, the 30-45 degree elevation is intended to optimize venous return while maintaining CPP.",

Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees facilitates venous drainage, reducing cerebral blood volume and subsequently lowering ICP. This positioning also helps to prevent cerebral edema and hematoma formation. Regular neurological assessments are essential to monitor for signs of increased ICP or other complications. Proper wound care is also necessary to prevent infection. Maintaining the correct position and closely monitoring the patient are essential components of postoperative care."
