    "correct": "Severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) is a critical emergency due to its potential for causing life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.\n\n**Action 1: IV Regular Insulin and Dextrose (D50)**\n*   **Mechanism:** Insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, enhancing the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space. Dextrose (D50) is administered concurrently to prevent hypoglycemia, a potential adverse effect of insulin administration. This combination provides a rapid, albeit temporary, reduction in serum potassium levels.\n\n**Action 2: Intravenous Calcium Gluconate**\n*   **Mechanism:** Calcium gluconate does not directly lower serum potassium levels. Instead, it acts as a membrane stabilizer, increasing the threshold potential of cardiac cells. This reduces the excitability of the myocardium and protects against the arrhythmogenic effects of hyperkalemia, such as ventricular fibrillation and asystole. It essentially 'shields' the heart.",
    "incorrect": "**Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Kayexalate):** This medication exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting potassium excretion via the feces. While effective in lowering potassium levels, its onset of action is slow (hours to days), making it unsuitable for acute hyperkalemia management.\n\n**Furosemide (Lasix):** This loop diuretic promotes potassium excretion via the kidneys. However, its effect on potassium levels is relatively slow and may be insufficient to address severe hyperkalemia rapidly. Furthermore, it can lead to volume depletion, potentially exacerbating electrolyte imbalances.",
