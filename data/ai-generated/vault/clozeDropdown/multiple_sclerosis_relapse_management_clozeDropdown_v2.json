        "correct": "Corticosteroids, specifically high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, are the first-line treatment for acute MS relapses. They act by suppressing the inflammatory response in the central nervous system, reducing edema around demyelinated plaques, and promoting axonal recovery. Plasma exchange (PLEX) is considered when patients do not respond to corticosteroids or have severe relapses. PLEX removes antibodies and inflammatory mediators from the circulation, thereby mitigating the autoimmune attack on myelin. This can lead to improved neurological function in severe cases.",
        "incorrect": "Antispasmodics are used to manage muscle spasticity associated with MS, not to treat acute relapses. Interferons are used as a long-term disease-modifying therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, not for acute relapse management. Amantadine is used to treat fatigue in MS patients, not for acute relapse management. Physical therapy is an important component of rehabilitation but does not directly address the acute inflammatory process of a relapse. While interferons are a disease-modifying therapy, they are not typically used as a first-line treatment for acute relapses.",

High-dose corticosteroids are the mainstay, followed by plasma exchange if needed. Long-term management involves disease-modifying therapies to prevent future relapses. Rehabilitation and symptom management are also crucial aspects of care, addressing issues like spasticity, fatigue, and mobility impairments. Monitoring for adverse effects of treatments is essential, as is patient education on self-management strategies."
