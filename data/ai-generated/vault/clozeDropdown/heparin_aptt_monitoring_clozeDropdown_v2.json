This range indicates adequate anticoagulation, preventing clot formation while minimizing the risk of bleeding. A prolonged aPTT indicates excessive anticoagulation, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Protamine sulfate neutralizes heparin's anticoagulant activity. Monitoring aPTT and having protamine sulfate available are crucial for managing heparin-induced bleeding risks.",
        "incorrect": "An aPTT of 0.5 to 1.0 times the baseline suggests subtherapeutic anticoagulation. An aPTT of 3.0 to 4.0 times the baseline indicates excessive anticoagulation and a high risk of bleeding. Shortened aPTT values suggest hypercoagulability, which is not the concern during heparin therapy. An unchanged aPTT suggests that the heparin is not having the desired therapeutic effect.",

It requires close monitoring via aPTT to maintain a therapeutic range (1.5-2.5 times baseline) and avoid complications like bleeding. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for heparin overdose, neutralizing its anticoagulant effects. Regular assessment of aPTT and vigilant monitoring for bleeding are crucial during heparin therapy."
