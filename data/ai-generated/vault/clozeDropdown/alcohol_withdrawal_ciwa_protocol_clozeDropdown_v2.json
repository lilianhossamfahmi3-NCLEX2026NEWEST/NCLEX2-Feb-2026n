        "correct": "A CIWA-Ar score above 15 signifies severe alcohol withdrawal due to significant central nervous system (CNS) hyperactivity. Alcohol, a CNS depressant, causes the brain to adapt over time, reducing its natural inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA) and increasing excitatory neurotransmission (glutamate). Abrupt cessation of alcohol leads to unopposed excitatory activity, resulting in symptoms like tremors, anxiety, agitation, and potentially seizures. A high CIWA-Ar score reflects this heightened state, necessitating prompt pharmacological intervention with benzodiazepines or other agents to restore CNS balance and prevent complications. Conversely, a score below 8 suggests minimal withdrawal symptoms, indicating the CNS has not experienced significant dysregulation due to alcohol cessation. This allows for less aggressive interventions and closer monitoring.",
        "incorrect": "Mild withdrawal doesn't warrant intervention (it does sometimes). Moderate withdrawal doesn't automatically mean a CIWA >15. A CIWA <8 does not require ICU transfer, and it is not indicative of imminent DTs. Delirium tremens is a severe complication usually seen with higher CIWA scores and in patients with prolonged alcohol dependence. Immediate transfer to ICU is reserved for patients with severe symptoms or complications like seizures.",

Scores guide pharmacological management, with higher scores indicating the need for more aggressive treatment. Understanding the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal, involving GABA and glutamate dysregulation, is crucial for interpreting CIWA-Ar scores accurately and implementing appropriate interventions. Regular reassessment is essential to titrate medications effectively and prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens."
