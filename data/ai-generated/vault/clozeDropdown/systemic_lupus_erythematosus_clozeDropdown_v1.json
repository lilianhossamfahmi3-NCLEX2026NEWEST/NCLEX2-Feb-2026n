    "correct": "SLE is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and tissue damage. Direct sunlight and UV exposure can trigger SLE flares due to increased production of autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines in the skin. This photosensitivity leads to skin rashes and exacerbation of systemic symptoms. Lupus nephritis, inflammation of the kidneys, is a major complication of SLE, potentially leading to kidney failure. Clients must monitor for proteinuria (foamy urine), hematuria (blood in urine), and elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent irreversible kidney damage.",
    "incorrect": "Mild-to-moderate physical activity is generally encouraged in SLE patients to improve muscle strength, reduce fatigue, and enhance overall well-being, as tolerated. Pancreatitis is not a primary manifestation of SLE, although it can occur rarely due to vasculitis or medication side effects. Hyperthyroidism is not directly associated with SLE pathophysiology.",
