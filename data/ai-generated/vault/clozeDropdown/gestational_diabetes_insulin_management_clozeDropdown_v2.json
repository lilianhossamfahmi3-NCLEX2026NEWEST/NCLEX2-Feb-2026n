        "correct": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) requires careful insulin management to maintain euglycemia and prevent adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The typical starting insulin dose for GDM is 0.7 to 1.0 units/kg of body weight, divided into multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This range accounts for the increased insulin resistance associated with pregnancy due to placental hormones like human placental lactogen (hPL) and cortisol, which antagonize insulin action, leading to higher blood glucose levels. Postprandial and fasting glucose monitoring is crucial for adjusting insulin dosages to achieve target glucose levels, typically <95 mg/dL fasting and <140 mg/dL one hour postprandially.",
        "incorrect": "Using 0.2 to 0.4 units/kg is too low for the initial insulin dose in gestational diabetes, as the insulin resistance during pregnancy requires a higher starting dose to achieve glycemic control. This lower dose is more appropriate for type 1 diabetes in the honeymoon phase or for very insulin-sensitive individuals. Insulin adjustments should not be based solely on random glucose monitoring, as it does not provide a complete picture of glycemic control throughout the day. Random glucose readings can be affected by recent food intake or activity levels, making them unreliable for making informed decisions about insulin dosage adjustments. Relying on preprandial glucose monitoring only is insufficient, as postprandial glucose excursions significantly impact HbA1c levels and fetal outcomes in gestational diabetes. Both fasting and postprandial glucose levels must be assessed to optimize insulin therapy.",
