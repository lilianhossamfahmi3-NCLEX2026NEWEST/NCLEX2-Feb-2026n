        "correct": "Initiating ESAs when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL helps alleviate symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, and reduces the need for blood transfusions. Maintaining hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL minimizes the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction, which have been associated with higher hemoglobin levels in patients with CKD. Studies have demonstrated that targeting higher hemoglobin levels with ESAs does not improve patient outcomes and may increase mortality and cardiovascular events. Therefore, careful monitoring and titration of ESA dosage are essential to achieve optimal hemoglobin levels and minimize risks.",
        "incorrect": "Selecting 12 g/dL for blank 1 is incorrect because current guidelines recommend initiating ESAs at a lower hemoglobin level to prevent severe anemia-related complications. Waiting until 12 g/dL may result in significant morbidity. Selecting 8 g/dL is incorrect as this level represents severe anemia and would likely require immediate intervention beyond ESA therapy. Selecting 13 g/dL or 15 g/dL for blank 2 is incorrect because maintaining hemoglobin levels above 11 g/dL increases the risk of cardiovascular events without providing additional clinical benefits. Higher targets were previously used, but research has shown they are detrimental.",

The goal is to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10-11 g/dL to alleviate anemia symptoms while minimizing the risk of cardiovascular events. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin, iron stores, and blood pressure is essential. Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient response and tolerance. Failure to maintain appropriate hemoglobin levels may require further investigation to rule out other causes of anemia, such as blood loss or iron deficiency. Always consider patient-specific factors and comorbidities when managing anemia in CKD."
