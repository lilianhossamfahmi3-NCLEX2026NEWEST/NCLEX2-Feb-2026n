If the chest tube is dislodged, covering the site with a sterile occlusive dressing taped on three sides allows air to escape on exhalation but prevents air from entering on inhalation, mitigating the risk of a tension pneumothorax. This creates a one-way valve effect.",

Applying direct pressure without an occlusive dressing can allow air to enter the pleural space, worsening the pneumothorax. Continuous bubbling is never considered normal. Direct pressure should be applied with a sterile gloved hand, not a non-sterile one.",
