        "correct": "Basal rates must be adjusted based on activity levels to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Increased physical activity necessitates a reduction in basal rate, while sedentary periods may require an increase. Monitoring blood glucose trends helps identify patterns and adjust basal rates accordingly. Bolus doses should be calculated using the carbohydrate intake and the individual's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. This ensures that the correct amount of insulin is administered to cover the carbohydrate load from meals, preventing postprandial hyperglycemia. The insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio is a critical factor in determining the appropriate bolus dose.",
        "incorrect": "Meal composition alone does not provide enough information for basal rate adjustment; activity levels and blood glucose trends are crucial. Parental preference should not dictate basal rates; adjustments must be based on physiological needs. Patient's age alone is insufficient for bolus dose calculation; carbohydrate intake and the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio are essential. Time of day alone is not adequate for bolus dose calculation; the specific carbohydrate content of the meal must be considered. Ignoring activity levels and blood glucose trends when adjusting basal rates can lead to glycemic instability.",

Regular monitoring and communication with the healthcare team are crucial for optimal glycemic control. Failure to properly adjust insulin dosages can result in dangerous hypo- or hyperglycemia."
