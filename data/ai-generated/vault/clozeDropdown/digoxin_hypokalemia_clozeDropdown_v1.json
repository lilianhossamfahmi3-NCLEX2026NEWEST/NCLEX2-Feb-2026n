        "correct": "Digoxin toxicity is a serious concern when a patient is also taking a potassium-depleting diuretic like furosemide. Hypokalemia (low potassium) significantly increases the risk of digoxin toxicity because digoxin and potassium compete for binding sites on the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in cardiac cells. When potassium levels are low, more digoxin binds to the pump, leading to increased intracellular calcium and enhanced cardiac contractility, but also increasing the risk of arrhythmias and other toxic effects. Assessing the apical pulse for a full minute prior to digoxin administration is crucial to detect bradycardia (heart rate <60 bpm), a common sign of digoxin toxicity. If the apical pulse is below 60 bpm, the dose should be held, and the provider notified.",
        "incorrect": {
            "Hypokalemia": "Incorrect. Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can cause potassium loss, exacerbating this risk.",
            "Hyperkalemia": "Incorrect. Hyperkalemia can decrease digoxin's effectiveness, but hypokalemia poses a greater risk of toxicity.",
            "Hyponatremia": "Incorrect. Hyponatremia does not directly affect digoxin toxicity.",
            "Apical Pulse": "Correct. Assessing the apical pulse is essential to detect bradycardia before administering digoxin. Bradycardia is a common sign of digoxin toxicity.",
            "Radial Pulse": "Incorrect. The apical pulse provides a more accurate assessment of heart rate, especially in patients with arrhythmias. The radial pulse may not accurately reflect the heart rate in these cases.",
            "Blood Pressure": "Incorrect. While blood pressure is important, the apical pulse is the priority assessment for digoxin administration to detect bradycardia."
