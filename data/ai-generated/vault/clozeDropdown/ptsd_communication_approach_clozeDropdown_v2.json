        "correct": "Creating a sense of safety is paramount in trauma-informed care. PTSD patients often experience hyperarousal and anxiety, making them highly sensitive to perceived threats. Predictable and consistent interactions help regulate their nervous system by reducing uncertainty and anxiety. Seeking and valuing the patient's perspective acknowledges their autonomy and lived experience, fostering trust and collaboration in their care. This approach supports empowerment and promotes a sense of control, crucial for recovery from trauma. Respecting the patient's perspective demonstrates empathy and understanding, validating their experiences and promoting healing.",
        "incorrect": "Urgency is incorrect because it can increase anxiety and trigger hyperarousal in PTSD patients. Detachment is incorrect as it can lead to the patient feeling invalidated and unsupported. Compliance is incorrect because simply seeking compliance negates the patient's autonomy and can trigger feelings of powerlessness, mirroring past trauma. Deference is incorrect because while respect is crucial, deference can create an unequal power dynamic and may not foster a collaborative relationship.",

Key principles include safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural sensitivity. Effective communication involves active listening, validation, and avoiding language that may trigger traumatic memories. Nurses should also be aware of their own potential triggers and practice self-care to prevent compassion fatigue. Understanding the neurobiological impact of trauma on the brain and body helps nurses provide more compassionate and effective care."
