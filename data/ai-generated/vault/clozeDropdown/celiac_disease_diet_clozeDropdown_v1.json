    "correct": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. (1) Gluten ingestion leads to inflammation and damage of the small intestine's villi, impairing nutrient absorption. (2) A strict gluten-free diet is crucial for managing the disease and preventing long-term complications. Rice, corn, and potatoes are naturally gluten-free and safe for consumption, providing essential carbohydrates and nutrients without triggering the immune response.",

    "deepPathophysiologyRationale": "In Celiac disease, the ingestion of gluten triggers an immune response in the small intestine. Gluten is broken down into gliadin, which then activates T cells in the lamina propria. These activated T cells release inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-15, which damage the epithelial cells lining the small intestine. This damage leads to villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intestinal permeability. The resulting malabsorption of nutrients contributes to the various clinical manifestations of Celiac disease, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and nutrient deficiencies. Long-term complications of untreated Celiac disease can include anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, and an increased risk of certain cancers.",
