        "correct": "Monitoring vital capacity is paramount in Guillain-Barré syndrome because ascending paralysis can affect the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Frequent assessment allows for early detection of declining respiratory function, prompting timely interventions such as intubation and mechanical ventilation. Autonomic dysfunction is a frequent complication, affecting blood pressure and heart rate, which are crucial indicators of cardiovascular stability. Changes can manifest as fluctuations in blood pressure (hypotension or hypertension) and arrhythmias, necessitating prompt management to prevent life-threatening complications.",
        "incorrect": "Monitoring muscle strength in the lower extremities, while important for tracking disease progression, is not the immediate priority when respiratory compromise is imminent. Assessing bowel sounds is important for overall gastrointestinal function but is not as critical as respiratory and cardiovascular parameters in the acute phase of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Pupillary response is relevant for neurological assessment but less indicative of the autonomic instability directly associated with GBS. Deep tendon reflexes are useful for evaluating the extent of motor involvement but are not as time-sensitive as monitoring for autonomic dysregulation.",

Monitoring respiratory function, including vital capacity and arterial blood gases, is essential to detect respiratory compromise early. Autonomic dysfunction is also common, leading to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, which require vigilant monitoring and management. Prompt recognition and intervention are critical to prevent life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability. Treatment focuses on supportive care, including mechanical ventilation if needed, and immunomodulatory therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange."
