        "correct": "In primary hyperthyroidism, such as Graves' disease, the thyroid gland autonomously produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). This overproduction leads to a negative feedback loop, suppressing the release of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Consequently, serum TSH levels are characteristically low, while free T4 levels are elevated. This inverse relationship is a hallmark of primary hyperthyroidism.",
        "incorrect": "High TSH with high T4 would indicate secondary hyperthyroidism, often due to a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. In this scenario, the pituitary is driving the overproduction of thyroid hormones. Normal TSH and T4 levels would suggest euthyroidism, while low T4 could indicate hypothyroidism.",

            "Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Classic signs and symptoms include exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs), goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland), heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, tachycardia, and anxiety. A thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication characterized by severe hyperthermia, tachycardia, and altered mental status.",
            "SBAR Example (140 words, Military Time):\n\n**Situation:** Mr. Jones, a 45-year-old male with Graves' disease, is experiencing increased anxiety and palpitations.\n\n**Background:** Mr. Jones was diagnosed with Graves' disease six months ago and has been taking methimazole 5mg daily. He reports missing several doses this week.\n\n**Assessment:** Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, Temp 38.2°C (100.8°F). Patient is restless and diaphoretic. Thyroid gland is visibly enlarged. Labs are pending, but based on presentation, suspect worsening hyperthyroidism. Patient reports chest discomfort.\n\n**Recommendation:** Please order stat TSH and free T4 levels. Consider increasing methimazole dosage and administering a beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol) to manage tachycardia and anxiety. Monitor for signs of thyroid storm. Obtain an ECG to evaluate chest discomfort. Consult endocrinology."

            "distractorRationale": "Selecting 'increased (high)' for TSH suggests a pituitary problem (secondary hyperthyroidism) rather than a thyroid problem. Selecting 'decreased (low)' for T4 suggests hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Selecting 'normal' for either TSH or T4 would not be consistent with the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism."
