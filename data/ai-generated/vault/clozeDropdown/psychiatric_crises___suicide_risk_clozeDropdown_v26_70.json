            "SBAR": "14:00. S: Robert Jones, a 34-year-old male, presented to the ED agitated and expressing feelings of hopelessness. He states, \"Life isn't worth living anymore.\" He has a history of major depressive disorder and a previous suicide attempt two years ago by overdose. B: He was found by his roommate after sending a text message implying suicidal intent. He has been off his antidepressant medication (sertraline) for the past month due to side effects. He reports increased stress at work and relationship difficulties. A: The patient is currently alert and oriented but exhibits signs of severe anxiety and depression. He is pacing and has tearful affect. He denies current active suicidal ideation but admits to passive thoughts of death. Vital signs are stable. R: I recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation, initiation of suicide precautions, and a review of his medication regimen. Consider restarting sertraline at a lower dose or exploring alternative antidepressant options. Monitor closely for changes in mood and behavior.",

Next, it is essential to assess the patient's [2] risk by directly asking about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means.
