Next, it is essential to assess the patient's [2] risk by directly asking about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means. If the patient is deemed to be at [3] risk for suicide, the nurse should initiate suicide precautions, such as constant observation and removal of potentially harmful items.",

This enables the nurse to gather accurate information and provide effective support. Assessing suicide risk (Option 2: suicide) involves directly asking the patient about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means. This assessment helps determine the severity of the risk and guides appropriate interventions.
