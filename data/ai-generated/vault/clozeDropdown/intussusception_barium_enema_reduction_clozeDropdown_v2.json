Broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential in treating peritonitis resulting from perforation, preventing further systemic infection by covering a wide range of potential bacterial pathogens released into the peritoneal cavity. Antibiotics help control the infection and prevent septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication.",

Increased appetite is not associated with perforation. Antipyretics are used to reduce fever, which may or may not be present with perforation. Stool softeners are not indicated in the acute management of a perforation.",

Nursing assessments should focus on abdominal changes, vital signs, and pain levels to detect complications promptly. Communicate any concerning findings to the healthcare provider immediately."
