        "correct": "Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a preferred first-line tocolytic agent because it inhibits uterine contractions by blocking calcium influx into myometrial cells, leading to uterine relaxation. Its effectiveness and relatively favorable side effect profile compared to other tocolytics make it a common choice for initial management of preterm labor. Nifedipine's primary side effect is vasodilation, leading to hypotension. Monitoring blood pressure is crucial during administration to avoid adverse maternal and fetal outcomes due to decreased placental perfusion. Reflex tachycardia can occur in response to the hypotension.",
        "incorrect": "Oxytocin is a uterotonic agent used to induce or augment labor, contraindicated in preterm labor when the goal is to halt contractions. Misoprostol is also a uterotonic prostaglandin analog, and is contraindicated as a tocolytic. Hypertension and tachycardia are not common primary side effects of nifedipine; rather, hypotension is the expected effect due to vasodilation. Hypertension is a potential side effect with beta-mimetics like terbutaline (not first line). Tachycardia is also more associated with beta-mimetics.",

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a commonly used first-line agent. Monitoring maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate is crucial. Other tocolytics, such as magnesium sulfate and terbutaline, are used less frequently due to safety concerns and side effect profiles. The choice of tocolytic depends on gestational age, maternal health, and institutional protocols. Absolute contraindications include fetal demise, lethal fetal anomaly, non-reassuring fetal status and severe preeclampsia/eclampsia."
