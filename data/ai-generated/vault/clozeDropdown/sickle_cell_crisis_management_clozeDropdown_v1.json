    "correct": "Vaso-occlusive crisis occurs when sickled red blood cells obstruct blood flow in small vessels, leading to ischemia and severe pain. (1) **Intravenous hydration** (e.g., 0.9% normal saline at 125 mL/hr) reduces blood viscosity, improving microcirculation and preventing further sickling. Dehydration exacerbates sickling. (2) **Adequate oxygenation** (target SpO2 >92%) is crucial because hypoxia promotes sickling. Supplemental oxygen (via nasal cannula or mask) may be required. Warmth promotes vasodilation, improving blood flow. Cold causes vasoconstriction, worsening ischemia and pain. Pain management, typically with opioids (e.g., morphine 2-4 mg IV q2-4h PRN), is essential to address the intense pain associated with vaso-occlusion.",
    "incorrect": "Vigorous exercise and heat therapy are contraindicated; exercise increases oxygen demand, potentially worsening hypoxia and sickling. Heat can cause vasodilation, but the risk of dehydration from sweating outweighs the benefit. Oral iron supplements are ineffective for vaso-occlusive crisis because the problem is not iron deficiency but abnormal hemoglobin structure and red blood cell shape. Cold compresses are contraindicated due to vasoconstriction. Strict fluid restriction will worsen the crisis.",
