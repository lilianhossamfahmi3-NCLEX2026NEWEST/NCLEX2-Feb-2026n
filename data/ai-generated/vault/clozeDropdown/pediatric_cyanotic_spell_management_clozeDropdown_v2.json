        "correct": "Administering 100% oxygen is crucial to maximize the amount of oxygen available for hemoglobin saturation, even though the underlying problem is not primarily hypoxemia but rather decreased pulmonary blood flow due to infundibular spasm. The knee-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which reduces the right-to-left shunting of blood through the ventricular septal defect and redirects blood flow to the pulmonary artery for oxygenation. This position functionally increases afterload, making it more difficult for deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs.",
        "incorrect": "Normal saline bolus may be considered if hypovolemia is suspected, but is not the immediate first-line intervention for a hypercyanotic spell. It addresses volume status, not the primary issue of shunting. Oral propranolol is used for long-term management to prevent spells but is not appropriate for acute treatment due to its slow onset of action. The Trendelenburg position is used for hypotension or air embolism, not for increasing systemic vascular resistance. The supine position offers no physiological benefit in this situation and may exacerbate the cyanosis due to increased venous return without improved pulmonary blood flow.",

Hypercyanotic spells (also known as 'tet spells') are characterized by a sudden decrease in pulmonary blood flow, leading to increased cyanosis. Management involves interventions aimed at increasing systemic vascular resistance and decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance to improve pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent severe complications such as brain damage or death."
