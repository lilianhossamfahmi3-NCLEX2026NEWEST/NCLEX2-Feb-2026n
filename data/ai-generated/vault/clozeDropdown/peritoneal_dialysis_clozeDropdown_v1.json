    "correct": "Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Cloudy or opaque effluent indicates a potential infection due to the presence of increased white blood cells and bacteria. The peritoneum, normally a sterile space, becomes inflamed. Strict surgical aseptic technique, including masks and sterile gloves, is crucial during PD exchanges to prevent the introduction of pathogens into the peritoneal cavity. This minimizes the risk of infection and subsequent peritonitis.",

      "clear, yellow fluid": "Clear, yellow fluid is the expected appearance of PD effluent, indicating proper filtration and absence of infection.",
      "pink-tinged drainage": "Pink-tinged drainage may be observed immediately post-op or in menstruating women due to minor bleeding. It is not indicative of peritonitis unless accompanied by other signs like cloudy effluent, abdominal pain, or fever."
