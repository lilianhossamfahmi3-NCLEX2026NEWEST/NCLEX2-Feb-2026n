        "correct": "The infusion site is the most common cause of hyperglycemia and ketosis in patients using insulin pumps. Kinks, air bubbles, or disconnections can interrupt insulin delivery, leading to elevated blood glucose levels and the development of ketones. Assessing the infusion site allows for the quick identification and correction of mechanical issues, preventing further deterioration. Rapid-acting insulin is used to correct hyperglycemia because it has a quick onset and short duration of action, which allows for a rapid reduction in blood glucose levels without causing prolonged hypoglycemia. This is crucial in addressing acute hyperglycemia and ketosis.",
        "incorrect": "Catheter issues are part of the infusion site assessment, but do not encompass all possible issues. Battery issues would cause pump malfunction and alarms. Intermediate-acting insulin has a slower onset of action and is not suitable for rapidly correcting hyperglycemia. Long-acting insulin has a prolonged duration of action and is not used for bolus dosing to correct acute hyperglycemia.",

The pump delivers a basal rate of insulin to cover the patient's basic insulin needs and bolus doses to cover meals and correct hyperglycemia. When a patient on an insulin pump presents with hyperglycemia, it's crucial to first assess the pump and infusion site for any mechanical issues. Rapid-acting insulin analogs, such as lispro, aspart, and glulisine, are typically used in insulin pumps due to their rapid onset and short duration of action, allowing for precise bolus dosing to match carbohydrate intake or correct high blood glucose levels."
