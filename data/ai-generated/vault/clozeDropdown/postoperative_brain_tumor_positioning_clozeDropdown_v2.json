        "correct": "Elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees after a supratentorial craniotomy facilitates venous outflow from the brain, reducing cerebral blood volume and, consequently, ICP. This position optimizes cerebral perfusion pressure by minimizing pressure gradients that impede venous return. Maintaining the patient's head and neck in neutral alignment further prevents obstruction of jugular veins and ensures unobstructed cerebral venous drainage. This position, coupled with controlled fluid administration, minimizes cerebral edema formation and promotes optimal recovery following surgery.",
        "incorrect": "Positioning the patient at 0-10 degrees does not effectively promote venous drainage and may increase ICP due to gravity impeding venous return. Positioning the patient at 60-90 degrees may cause excessive neck flexion, which can obstruct venous outflow, and also may cause hypotension. Positioning the patient on the operative side may place pressure on the surgical site, potentially causing swelling and increased ICP. Flexing the neck can compress jugular veins, impeding venous outflow from the brain and increasing ICP.",
