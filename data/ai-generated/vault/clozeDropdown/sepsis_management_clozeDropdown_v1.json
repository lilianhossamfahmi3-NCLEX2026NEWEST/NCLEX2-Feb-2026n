    "correct": "In sepsis, the body's response to infection causes widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to hypotension and decreased tissue perfusion. A 500 mL bolus of 0.9% Normal Saline is the initial intervention to increase intravascular volume and improve blood pressure. If hypotension persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation, it indicates septic shock. Norepinephrine (Levophed), a potent vasopressor, is then administered to constrict blood vessels and increase systemic vascular resistance, thereby raising MAP and ensuring adequate organ perfusion. The goal MAP in septic shock is typically ≥65 mmHg.",
    "incorrect": "Furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic that promotes fluid excretion, which would further decrease intravascular volume and worsen hypotension in a septic patient. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is an antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions and has no role in the management of septic shock. A unit of packed red blood cells is not the first-line treatment for hypotension in sepsis unless the patient is also anemic.",
