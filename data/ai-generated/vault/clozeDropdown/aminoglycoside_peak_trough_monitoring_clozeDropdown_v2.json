        "correct": "The peak level of an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin, reflects the maximum concentration of the drug in the bloodstream after administration. Drawing the peak level approximately 30 minutes after the IV infusion ensures that the drug has reached its highest concentration. Conversely, the trough level represents the lowest concentration of the drug in the bloodstream just before the next dose. Monitoring the trough level helps to prevent drug accumulation, which can lead to toxicities. Maintaining therapeutic drug levels while minimizing toxicity risk is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes.",
        "incorrect": "Drawing a random level provides no clinically relevant information regarding either peak efficacy or risk of toxicity. Drawing a trough level for the peak measurement would yield a falsely low value and could lead to underdosing. Drawing a peak level for the trough measurement would yield a falsely high value and could mask drug accumulation, leading to toxicity. Random levels do not correlate with the therapeutic window of the medication and are therefore unhelpful. The timing of the blood draw is critical for accurate interpretation of the result. Drawing either level at the wrong time invalidates the assessment of therapeutic range.",

Peak and trough levels are essential for optimizing efficacy and minimizing the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Monitoring involves drawing blood samples at specific times relative to drug administration. The peak level reflects the maximum drug concentration, while the trough level reflects the minimum concentration just before the next dose. Adjustments to the dosage regimen are based on these levels, ensuring that the drug remains within the therapeutic range while avoiding accumulation that can lead to adverse effects. Renal function monitoring is also critical due to the nephrotoxic potential of these medications."
