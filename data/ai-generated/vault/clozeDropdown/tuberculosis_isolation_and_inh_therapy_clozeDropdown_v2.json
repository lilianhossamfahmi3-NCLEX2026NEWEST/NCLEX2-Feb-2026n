    "correct": "Airborne precautions are necessary to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is transmitted via airborne droplet nuclei. Isoniazid (INH) is hepatotoxic; therefore, monitoring for signs and symptoms of liver damage is crucial. INH inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall, disrupting cell wall integrity and leading to cell death. The liver metabolizes INH, and potential toxic metabolites can cause hepatocellular injury.",
    "incorrect": "Contact precautions are used for infections spread by direct or indirect contact. Droplet precautions are used for infections spread by large respiratory droplets over short distances. While INH can have various side effects, hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia are not the primary concerns. Hypoglycemia relates to low blood sugar levels, which are not directly associated with INH's mechanism. Hyperkalemia, elevated potassium levels, is also not a typical side effect of INH. Peripheral neuropathy is a more common side effect, but hepatotoxicity is a greater risk.",

Airborne precautions, including a negative pressure room and N95 respirator, are crucial to prevent transmission. Isoniazid (INH) is a key medication in TB treatment, targeting mycolic acid synthesis in the bacterial cell wall. Regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity, including liver function tests, is essential due to INH's potential to cause liver damage."
