        "correct": "Airborne precautions are essential to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as the bacteria are transmitted via airborne droplet nuclei. INH is hepatotoxic; therefore, monitoring for signs of liver damage is crucial. Isoniazid (INH) is a prodrug that requires activation by a mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme, KatG. Once activated, INH inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. This inhibition disrupts cell wall integrity, leading to cell death and preventing the bacteria from replicating and spreading within the host. The liver metabolizes INH, and potential toxic metabolites can cause hepatocellular injury.",
        "incorrect": "Contact precautions are used for infections spread by direct or indirect contact. Droplet precautions are used for infections spread by large respiratory droplets, which travel short distances. While INH can have various side effects, hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia are not the primary concerns. Hypoglycemia relates to low blood sugar levels, which are not directly associated with INH's mechanism. Hyperkalemia, elevated potassium levels, is also not a typical side effect of INH. Peripheral neuropathy is a more common side effect, but hepatotoxicity is a greater risk.",
