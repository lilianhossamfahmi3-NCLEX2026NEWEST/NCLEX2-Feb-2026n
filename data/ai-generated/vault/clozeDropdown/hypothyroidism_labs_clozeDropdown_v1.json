    "correct": "In primary hypothyroidism, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient amounts of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This is often due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid tissue. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland sense the low T4 levels. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Because the thyroid is damaged and unresponsive, TSH levels rise significantly in an attempt to stimulate thyroid hormone production, resulting in elevated TSH and decreased T4. This feedback loop is disrupted at the level of the thyroid gland itself.",
    "incorrect": "Low TSH with low T4 would indicate secondary (pituitary) hypothyroidism, where the pituitary gland is not producing enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid. Normal TSH and T4 levels indicate a euthyroid state. High TSH and high T4 would indicate thyroid hormone resistance or a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (rare).",
