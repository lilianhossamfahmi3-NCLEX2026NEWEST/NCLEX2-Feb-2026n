    "correct": "Hypoparathyroidism results in decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, leading to hypocalcemia. (1) Low serum calcium increases neuromuscular excitability, causing tetany. Trousseau's sign (carpal spasm elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure for 3 minutes) and Chvostek's sign (facial muscle twitching when the facial nerve is tapped) are classic indicators of hypocalcemia. The underlying pathophysiology involves increased neuronal membrane permeability to sodium ions, leading to spontaneous depolarization and muscle contractions. (2) Intravenous calcium gluconate is the emergency treatment for symptomatic hypocalcemia, tetany, or laryngospasm. Calcium gluconate directly increases serum calcium levels, stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing neuromuscular excitability. Monitor the client for bradycardia during administration.",
    "incorrect": "Lethargy and diminished deep tendon reflexes are typically associated with HYPERcalcemia, not hypocalcemia. Hypercalcemia depresses the nervous system, leading to decreased muscle tone and reflexes. Muscle weakness can be present in both conditions, but in hypocalcemia, it's often related to muscle cramping and spasms rather than true weakness.",
