Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes but has been non-compliant with medications. He lives alone and was found by a neighbor. Initial assessment reveals profound dehydration, confusion, and weakness. Blood glucose is currently 680 mg/dL. \n\nB: History of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Non-compliant with medications for the past 6 months. No known allergies. \n\nA: Currently, the client is receiving intravenous fluids (0.9% normal saline) at 500 mL/hr. Insulin infusion initiated at 5 units/hr. Frequent glucose monitoring is being performed. Mental status is fluctuating. Urine output is minimal. Serum osmolality is elevated. Electrolytes are being monitored closely. \n\nR: Continue current treatment plan. Monitor blood glucose and electrolytes every hour. Assess mental status frequently. Monitor urine output. Consider potassium replacement as indicated by lab results. Obtain cardiology consult. Possible step-down transfer as condition stabilizes.",

            "rationale": "In HHS, fluid replacement is the initial priority to address dehydration and hyperosmolarity. Isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% normal saline, are typically administered first to expand intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. Potassium replacement is crucial because insulin administration shifts potassium intracellularly, potentially leading to hypokalemia. Monitoring serum osmolality helps assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and prevent rapid shifts that could cause cerebral edema. Glucose levels must be lowered gradually to prevent rapid changes in serum osmolality and prevent cerebral edema. Sodium bicarbonate is not typically used in HHS unless the patient has severe acidosis (pH < 6.9), which is less common in HHS than in DKA. Rapidly correcting hyperglycemia without adequate fluid replacement can exacerbate hyperosmolarity. Administering dextrose too early can worsen hyperglycemia before the hyperosmolar state is adequately addressed. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is used to treat hyperkalemia, which is not the primary concern in HHS management.",
