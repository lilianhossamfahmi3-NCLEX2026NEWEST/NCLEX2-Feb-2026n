        "rationale": "In HHS, the primary goal is to correct dehydration and hyperosmolarity with intravenous fluids. Isotonic solutions like 0.9% normal saline are administered initially to expand intravascular volume, improve blood pressure, and enhance tissue perfusion. Insulin is administered to reduce hyperglycemia, but fluid replacement is the priority. Potassium replacement is essential because insulin shifts potassium into cells, potentially causing hypokalemia. Frequent monitoring of serum osmolality helps assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation and prevent rapid shifts that could lead to cerebral edema. Gradual correction of hyperglycemia is crucial to prevent rapid changes in serum osmolality, which can also contribute to cerebral edema. Rapid correction of hyperglycemia without adequate fluid replacement can worsen hyperosmolarity. Administering dextrose too early can exacerbate hyperglycemia before the hyperosmolar state is adequately addressed. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is used to treat hyperkalemia, which is not the primary concern in HHS management.",
