        "correct": "Aggressive fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of rhabdomyolysis management. The rationale behind this is to increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, diluting the myoglobin released from damaged muscle tissue. Myoglobin can precipitate in the renal tubules, leading to tubular obstruction and acute kidney injury. Maintaining a high urine output (100-150 mL/hour) ensures adequate myoglobin clearance, preventing its accumulation and subsequent renal damage. Isotonic fluids like normal saline are typically used for this purpose.",
        "incorrect": "Vasopressors are used to increase blood pressure in hypotensive patients and are not directly indicated for myoglobin clearance in rhabdomyolysis. Blood transfusions are indicated for anemia or blood loss, not for rhabdomyolysis management. A urine output of 20-30 mL/hour indicates inadequate fluid resuscitation and increases the risk of myoglobin-induced acute kidney injury. A urine output of 5-10 mL/hour is indicative of severe oliguria or anuria, which is highly concerning and requires immediate intervention to prevent renal failure.",
