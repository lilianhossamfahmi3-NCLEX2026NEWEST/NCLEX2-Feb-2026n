        "correct": "Direct albumin infusion in nephrotic syndrome is generally discouraged because the infused albumin is rapidly excreted in the urine due to the glomerular damage characteristic of the syndrome. This transient increase in serum albumin levels does not address the underlying pathology and can lead to fluid overload and exacerbate edema. Furthermore, albumin infusion can temporarily suppress the body's own albumin production, potentially worsening the long-term hypoalbuminemia. Management focuses on controlling proteinuria with medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, managing edema with diuretics, and addressing the underlying glomerular disease with immunosuppressants if indicated. Dietary modifications, including moderate protein intake, are also essential.",
        "incorrect": "Encouraging albumin infusion would worsen edema and not address the underlying issue of glomerular damage leading to albumin loss. Routinely indicating albumin infusion is incorrect as it's not a first-line treatment due to its transient effects and potential complications. Hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia are not directly exacerbated by albumin infusion in the context of nephrotic syndrome; edema is the primary concern due to the oncotic pressure changes and fluid shifts.",

Management primarily focuses on treating the underlying cause of glomerular damage, controlling proteinuria with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, managing edema with diuretics and sodium restriction, and addressing hyperlipidemia with statins. Albumin infusion is generally reserved for severe cases with symptomatic hypoalbuminemia due to its transient effect and potential to worsen edema. Regular monitoring of fluid balance, kidney function, and serum albumin levels is crucial in managing patients with nephrotic syndrome."
