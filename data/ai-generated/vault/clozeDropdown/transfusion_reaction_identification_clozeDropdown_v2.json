        "correct": "Stopping the transfusion is the priority action when a patient exhibits signs of a possible transfusion reaction. Urticaria and pruritus can be early indicators of a more severe reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Immediate cessation of the transfusion prevents further exposure to the causative antigens. Following the immediate cessation, assessing the patient for further signs and symptoms is crucial to determine the severity and nature of the reaction. This includes monitoring vital signs, respiratory status, and skin changes. Further assessment guides subsequent interventions and reporting.",
        "incorrect": "Administering antihistamines might alleviate the symptoms of urticaria and pruritus, but it does not address the underlying cause of the reaction and delays the necessary action of stopping the transfusion. Slowing the transfusion rate is inappropriate as it still exposes the patient to the potential allergen and can exacerbate the reaction. Documenting the findings and notifying the blood bank are important steps but are secondary to stopping the transfusion and assessing the patient. Delaying the assessment could lead to a worsening of the reaction, potentially resulting in a life-threatening situation. Notifying the blood bank before assessing the patient would lead to wasted time as the nurse needs to assess the patient before contacting the blood bank.",

Recognizing early signs and symptoms, such as urticaria, fever, chills, and respiratory distress, is crucial for prompt intervention. The initial action in any suspected transfusion reaction is to immediately stop the transfusion, followed by assessing the patient, maintaining airway support, and notifying the healthcare provider. Accurate documentation and adherence to institutional protocols are essential for patient safety and quality improvement."
