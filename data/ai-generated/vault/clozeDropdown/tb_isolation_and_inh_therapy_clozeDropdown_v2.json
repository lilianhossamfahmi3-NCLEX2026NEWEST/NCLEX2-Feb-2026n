        "correct": "Airborne precautions are essential for patients with suspected or confirmed active tuberculosis due to the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis via small airborne particles (droplet nuclei). These particles can remain suspended in the air for extended periods and travel considerable distances. Hepatotoxicity is a significant adverse effect of isoniazid (INH) therapy, resulting from the drug's metabolism in the liver. INH can cause hepatocellular damage, leading to elevated liver enzymes and, in severe cases, liver failure. Monitoring for symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and dark urine is crucial.",
        "incorrect": "Droplet precautions are used for infections transmitted via larger respiratory droplets, not small airborne particles like those carrying TB. Contact precautions are implemented for infections spread through direct contact. INH is primarily metabolized in the liver, making hepatotoxicity the primary concern. While some drugs can affect the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) or the ears (ototoxicity), these are not the primary adverse effects associated with INH therapy.",
