        "correct": "Effective breastfeeding is crucial for bilirubin excretion. A proper latch ensures adequate milk transfer, which promotes frequent stools and bilirubin elimination. Assessing the infant's latch and suckling pattern helps determine if the infant is effectively extracting milk. Breast fullness after feeding indicates milk transfer, as the breasts should feel softer after a feeding session. Inadequate milk intake leads to less frequent stools, causing bilirubin to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, exacerbating jaundice.",
        "incorrect": "Skin turgor assesses hydration status, which is important but not the immediate priority in evaluating breastfeeding effectiveness for jaundice. Muscle tone is related to neurological function and not directly indicative of breastfeeding effectiveness. Hemoglobin level and urinary output are important indicators of the newborn's overall health, but are not as relevant as assessing the milk supply and transfer. Monitoring urinary output is a later step in assessment if initial breastfeeding problems are identified.",

When intake is insufficient, bilirubin is reabsorbed, leading to jaundice. Assessing latch, suckling, milk transfer, and stooling patterns are crucial. Interventions include improving breastfeeding technique, increasing feeding frequency, and, in severe cases, phototherapy. Early detection and intervention are essential to prevent complications of hyperbilirubinemia."
