    "correct": "Retinal detachment is a surgical emergency occurring when the neural retina separates from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This separation disrupts the blood supply to the retina, leading to ischemia and potential permanent vision loss if untreated. (1) Flashing lights (photopsia) occur due to mechanical stimulation of the retina as the vitreous humor pulls away. Floaters result from blood or cellular debris released into the vitreous. (2) The 'curtain' sensation arises as the detached retina progressively obscures the visual field. The superior portion of the visual field is typically affected first when the detachment originates inferiorly due to gravity.",
    "incorrect": "Halos around lights and intense eye pain are characteristic of acute angle-closure glaucoma, caused by a sudden blockage of aqueous humor outflow, leading to increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage. Gradual central vision loss is more indicative of macular degeneration, a progressive disease affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.",

      "Instruct the client to maintain bed rest in a position that allows gravity to help the retina fall back into place (e.g., if the detachment is superior, position the client supine). Avoid activities that increase intraocular pressure, such as bending over, straining during bowel movements, or heavy lifting. Administer prescribed medications, such as mydriatics and cycloplegics, to dilate the pupil and paralyze the ciliary muscle, reducing further retinal stress.",
      "SBAR: Situation: Client reports sudden onset of flashing lights and floaters in the right eye at 1400. Background: Client has a history of myopia. Assessment: Visual acuity decreased in the right eye; reports a 'curtain' sensation. Recommendation: STAT ophthalmology consult for possible retinal detachment. Prepare for possible surgical intervention."

The absence of pain is a key differentiating factor from conditions like acute angle-closure glaucoma, which presents with severe eye pain. If the patient has severe eye pain and vision loss, consider glaucoma or other inflammatory conditions."
