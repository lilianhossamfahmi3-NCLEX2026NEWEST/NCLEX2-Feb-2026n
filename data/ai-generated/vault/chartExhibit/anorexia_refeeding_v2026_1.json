    "correct": "Refeeding syndrome is a metabolic complication that occurs when nutritional support is given to severely malnourished clients. The primary hallmark is hypophosphatemia. When insulin is released in response to glucose/calories, it drives phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium into the cells. Among these, the profound drop in phosphorus (1.4 mg/dL) is the most specific and dangerous clinical indicator of refeeding syndrome as it can lead to cardiac and respiratory failure.",
