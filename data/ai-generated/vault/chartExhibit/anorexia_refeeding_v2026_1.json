When insulin is released in response to glucose/calories, it drives phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium into the cells. Among these, the profound drop in phosphorus (1.4 mg/dL) is the most specific and dangerous clinical indicator of refeeding syndrome as it can lead to cardiac and respiratory failure.",

The client has a history of restrictive eating and significant weight loss over the past several months.<br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>The client was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa one year ago and has had limited success with outpatient therapy. On admission at 08:00, vital signs were BP 88/54, HR 48, Temp 96.2°F. Initial labs were drawn.<br><br><b>ASSESSMENT:</b><br>The client is at high risk for refeeding syndrome due to her low BMI and prolonged malnutrition. Oral refeeding was initiated at 09:00 at 800 kcal/day, advanced to 1,400 kcal/day on Day 2, and 2,000 kcal/day on Day 3. Lab results on Day 3 at 10:00 show a significant drop in serum phosphorus from 3.2 mg/dL to 1.4 mg/dL, potassium decreased from 3.6 mEq/L to 3.1 mEq/L, and magnesium decreased from 1.9 mg/dL to 1.4 mg/dL. Glucose increased from 72 mg/dL to 112 mg/dL.<br><br><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b><br>Hold feeds and obtain an order for IV phosphorus replacement. Monitor cardiac rhythm and respiratory status closely. Consider reducing the caloric intake to prevent further electrolyte shifts."
