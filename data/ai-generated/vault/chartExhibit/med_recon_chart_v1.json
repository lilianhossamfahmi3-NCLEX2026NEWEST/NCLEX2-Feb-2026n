      "content": "**Correct (+):** The combination of warfarin, enoxaparin, and garlic significantly increases the risk of bleeding. Garlic possesses antiplatelet properties, potentiating the effects of both anticoagulants. This synergistic effect poses an immediate threat to the client's safety. **Mechanism:** Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Enoxaparin enhances antithrombin's activity, inhibiting Factor Xa. Garlic's allicin inhibits platelet aggregation. **Clinical Significance:** Herbal supplements can interact with prescribed medications, leading to adverse effects. Always assess for herbal supplement use, especially in clients on anticoagulants.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** The concurrent use of metformin and insulin is not contraindicated and is often necessary for managing hyperglycemia, especially in hospitalized clients. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, while insulin directly lowers blood glucose levels. **Mechanism:** Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity. Insulin facilitates glucose uptake into cells. **Clinical Significance:** Stress-induced hyperglycemia is common in hospitalized patients, requiring insulin therapy.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** The addition of enoxaparin while the client is on warfarin is a standard practice known as bridging therapy. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect is delayed, so enoxaparin provides immediate anticoagulation until the INR reaches a therapeutic level. **Mechanism:** Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of new clotting factors. Enoxaparin provides immediate anticoagulation by potentiating antithrombin. **Clinical Significance:** Bridging therapy is essential for providing immediate anticoagulation while waiting for warfarin to become effective.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** While the omission of atorvastatin should be addressed, it is not the most immediate concern. Atorvastatin is used for long-term management of hyperlipidemia. Omitting a dose or two does not pose an immediate threat compared to the risk of hemorrhage from the drug-herb interaction. **Mechanism:** Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis. **Clinical Significance:** Statins are important for long-term cardiovascular health, but their temporary omission is less critical than addressing immediate risks.",

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is failing to prioritize risks. Candidates may focus on the concurrent use of two anticoagulants (warfarin and enoxaparin) without recognizing it as standard bridging therapy. Another trap is focusing on the omitted atorvastatin, overlooking the immediate hemorrhage risk posed by the garlic supplement interaction. The stem was modified to emphasize the need to identify the *most* immediate concern.",
