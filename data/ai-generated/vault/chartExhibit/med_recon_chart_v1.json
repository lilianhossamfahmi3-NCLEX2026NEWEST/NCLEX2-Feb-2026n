      "content": "**Correct (+):** This is the priority. Garlic contains allicin, an antiplatelet agent that inhibits thromboxane synthesis, impairing platelet aggregation. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), and enoxaparin potentiates antithrombin to inactivate Factor Xa. This combination creates a synergistic effect, drastically increasing the risk of hemorrhage. **Pathophysiology:** Warfarin's mechanism involves blocking the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, preventing the recycling of vitamin K, which is essential for the carboxylation and activation of clotting factors. Enoxaparin binds to antithrombin, accelerating its inactivation of Factor Xa and, to a lesser extent, thrombin. Garlic's allicin inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking the formation of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator. **Clinical Pearl:** Always assess for herbal supplement use in patients on anticoagulants due to the high risk of bleeding complications.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** Concurrent use of metformin and insulin is appropriate, especially in hospitalized patients. Admission for DVT is a physiological stressor causing hyperglycemia. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. Sliding scale insulin provides rapid correction for high blood glucose. **Pathophysiology:** Metformin primarily works by reducing hepatic glucose production through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits gluconeogenesis. It also increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, improving glucose uptake. Insulin, on the other hand, facilitates glucose uptake into cells, lowering blood glucose levels. **Clinical Pearl:** Stress-induced hyperglycemia is common in hospitalized patients, and insulin is often needed to achieve adequate glycemic control.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** This describes standard bridging therapy for acute DVT. Warfarin's effect is delayed (3-5 days) as it inhibits the *synthesis* of new clotting factors, not those already circulating. Enoxaparin provides immediate anticoagulation by potentiating antithrombin III. Enoxaparin is administered concurrently until the INR is therapeutic (2.0-3.0). **Pathophysiology:** Warfarin's delayed onset is due to the half-lives of the existing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Enoxaparin, being a low-molecular-weight heparin, has a more predictable anticoagulant effect and a shorter half-life compared to unfractionated heparin. **Clinical Pearl:** Bridging therapy is essential to provide immediate anticoagulation while waiting for warfarin to reach therapeutic levels.",

      "content": "**Incorrect (-):** While a medication reconciliation error requiring clarification, it's not the most immediate threat. Atorvastatin manages hyperlipidemia to reduce future cardiovascular risk. Omitting a few doses doesn't pose an acute risk, unlike the hemorrhage risk from the drug-herb interaction. **Pathophysiology:** Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which blocks the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This leads to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. **Clinical Pearl:** While statins are important for long-term cardiovascular health, their temporary omission is less critical than addressing immediate risks like bleeding.",

  "questionTrap": "The primary trap is failing to prioritize risks. Candidates may identify the concurrent use of two anticoagulants (warfarin and enoxaparin) as a dangerous error, not recognizing it as standard 'bridging' therapy. Another trap is focusing on the omitted atorvastatin as a critical error, without weighing its long-term purpose against the immediate, life-threatening hemorrhage risk posed by the garlic supplement interaction.",
