After a large MI, the heart muscle may exhibit akinesis or hypokinesis, leading to stagnant blood in the left ventricle that can clot against the wall, forming a mural thrombus. If a piece of this clot breaks off, it can travel to the brain (a1) or the limbs. The echocardiogram finding of a left ventricular thrombus, combined with the sudden facial droop and aphasia, is highly suggestive of an embolic event.",
