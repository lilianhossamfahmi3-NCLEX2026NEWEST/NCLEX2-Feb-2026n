This medication does NOT lower potassium levels; instead, it antagonizes the effect of potassium on the cardiac cell membrane, stabilizing the heart and preventing a lethal rhythm. While Insulin and Albuterol shift potassium into cells, they take 15-30 minutes to take effect, which is too long in this emergency situation.",
