    "correct": "The most significant indicator of life-threatening compromise is the **cessation of snoring combined with a flat capnography waveform (a1)**. In an OSA patient who was previously snoring loudly, 'silence' combined with no measurable CO2 output (EtCO2 flat) indicates complete airway obstruction and apnea (respiratory arrest). While the SpO2 of 82% (a3) is critical, it is a lagging indicator of the arrest that has already occurred.",

      "In OSA, snoring is 'good' because it means the airway is still partially open. Silence + Apnea = Death.",
      "Patients with OSA are 2-3 times more sensitive to opioids due to their baseline chronic respiratory acidosis.",
