During this phase, the kidneys have repaired enough to filter blood (high urine output), but they cannot yet concentrate the urine or reabsorb electrolytes. This leads to massive fluid loss (1,800 mL in 8 hours) and electrolyte 'washout.' The highest priority is to monitor for hypovolemia/shock (positive orthostatics) and hypokalemia (K+ 3.2), which can cause fatal arrhythmias. Dialysis (a2) is typically stopped in this phase.",
