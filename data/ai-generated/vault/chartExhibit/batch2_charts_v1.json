The client's assessment data (JVD, crackles, pitting edema, 1.5 kg weight gain) are definitive signs of acute decompensated heart failure due to hypervolemia. The crackles indicate fluid is accumulating in the alveoli, compromising gas exchange. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle to inhibit the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, leading to potent diuresis. This action rapidly reduces intravascular volume (preload), which decreases the hydrostatic pressure causing the pulmonary and peripheral edema. Acting on the PRN order is a critical, independent nursing intervention to prevent progression to acute respiratory failure."

The pathophysiology explains each sign: 1) The drop in GCS from 14 to 12 reflects compression of the reticular activating system in the brainstem, impairing consciousness. 2) The left pupil becoming fixed and dilated (5mm) is caused by the uncus of the temporal lobe herniating and compressing the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III), which paralyzes pupillary constriction. 3) The right-sided weakness (3/5 strength) is caused by compression of the contralateral corticospinal (motor) tracts in the left cerebral peduncle.
