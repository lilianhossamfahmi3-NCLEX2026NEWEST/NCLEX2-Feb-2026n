The tell-tale clinical cue is the **'Curtain' or 'Shade'** being pulled over the vision (a1). In preeclampsia, the high pressure causes fluid to leak into the space behind the retina (exudate), pushing it off. Unlike a traumatic detachment, there are usually no 'tears,' and it often resolves once the blood pressure is controlled and the fetus is delivered.",
