            "optionA": "Neuromuscular blocking agents may be used to reduce oxygen consumption and improve ventilator synchrony in severe ARDS. By paralyzing the patient, the ventilator can effectively control respiration, leading to improved oxygenation and lung protection.",

Continuous monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic status is essential. Consider neuromuscular blockade to optimize ventilator synchrony in severe cases.",
        "questionTrap": "The question trap lies in selecting interventions that are generally used in respiratory distress but are contraindicated or less effective in ARDS. For example, increasing FiO2 alone is often insufficient to correct hypoxemia in ARDS due to intrapulmonary shunting. Recognizing the specific pathophysiology of ARDS is crucial for selecting appropriate interventions.",
