        "optionG": "ARDS is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. The patient's history of sepsis, chest X-ray findings (diffuse bilateral infiltrates), and lab values (decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio) confirm the diagnosis. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150 indicates severe hypoxemia, a hallmark of ARDS.",
        "optionA": "Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) such as vecuronium or cisatracurium, are used in severe ARDS to improve ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen consumption. By eliminating spontaneous breathing efforts, NMBAs allow for more effective control of ventilation, leading to improved oxygenation and lung protection. This intervention reduces the risk of patient-ventilator asynchrony, which can exacerbate lung injury. Clinical Pearl: BIS monitoring is essential to ensure adequate sedation during neuromuscular blockade.",
        "optionB": "A low tidal volume ventilation strategy (4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) is crucial in ARDS to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Lower tidal volumes reduce alveolar overdistension (volutrauma) and barotrauma, preventing further damage to the already compromised lung tissue. This approach is a cornerstone of ARDS management, supported by numerous clinical trials demonstrating improved outcomes. Question Trap: Avoid selecting higher tidal volumes, as they can worsen lung injury.",
        "optionE": "Prone positioning can improve oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing lung perfusion, reducing alveolar collapse, and promoting more uniform ventilation. In the supine position, gravity compresses the dorsal regions of the lungs, leading to atelectasis and impaired gas exchange. Prone positioning reverses this effect, opening up previously collapsed alveoli and improving ventilation-perfusion matching. Clinical Pearl: Prone positioning is typically implemented for at least 16 hours per day to maximize its benefits.",
        "optionJ": "Barotrauma, including pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation, especially in patients with ARDS. High airway pressures and alveolar overdistension can lead to lung injury and air leaks. Monitoring peak and plateau pressures is essential to minimize the risk of barotrauma. Question Trap: While pneumothorax is a potential complication, the radiology report indicates no current pneumothorax, but the risk remains elevated.",
        "optionK": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant risk in mechanically ventilated patients. Endotracheal intubation bypasses the natural airway defenses, increasing the susceptibility to bacterial colonization and infection. Implementing VAP prevention bundles, including elevation of the head of the bed, oral care with chlorhexidine, and minimizing sedation, is crucial to reduce the incidence of VAP. Mnemonic: VAP = Ventilator, Aspiration, Prevention.",
        "optionC": "Increasing FiO2 to 100% without addressing the underlying ventilation/perfusion mismatch in ARDS can lead to oxygen toxicity and is often insufficient to improve oxygenation due to intrapulmonary shunting.",
        "optionD": "While monitoring for pneumothorax is important in mechanically ventilated patients, it is a complication rather than the primary condition or an immediate intervention. The chest X-ray in the EHR does not indicate a pneumothorax.",
        "optionF": "While nutritional support is important, initiating enteral feedings is not a primary intervention in the acute management of ARDS. Hemodynamic stability and adequate oxygenation should be prioritized before initiating enteral feedings to prevent complications such as aspiration.",
        "optionH": "Pneumonia is a potential cause of ARDS, but the patient's ARDS is secondary to sepsis. The chest X-ray findings are consistent with ARDS rather than typical pneumonia.",
        "optionI": "Pulmonary embolism is not supported by the patient's history, clinical findings, or diagnostic tests in the EHR.",
        "optionL": "Cardiac arrest is not indicated by the patient's current vital signs or clinical presentation. While the patient is critically ill, there is no evidence of impending cardiac arrest.",
        "clinicalPearls": [
            "ARDS management focuses on lung-protective ventilation strategies (low tidal volume, permissive hypercapnia), prone positioning, and addressing the underlying cause (sepsis). Continuous monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic status is essential. Consider neuromuscular blockade to optimize ventilator synchrony in severe cases. Early mobilization, when feasible, can also improve outcomes."

For example, increasing FiO2 alone is often insufficient to correct hypoxemia in ARDS due to intrapulmonary shunting. Recognizing the specific pathophysiology of ARDS, particularly the non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange, is crucial for selecting appropriate interventions."
