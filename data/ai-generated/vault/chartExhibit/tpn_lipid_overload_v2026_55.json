When IV lipids are given too rapidly or over too long a period, the triglycerides can spike (> 1,000 mg/dL) and overwhelm the body's reticuloendothelial system (the 'cleanup' system involving the liver and spleen). This leads to the 'overload triad': **Fever**, **Splenomegaly/Hepatomegaly**, and **Thrombocytopenia** (low platelets). This is a life-threatening complication that requires immediate cessation of the lipid infusion.",
