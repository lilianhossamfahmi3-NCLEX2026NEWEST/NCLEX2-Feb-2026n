This syndrome occurs when IV lipids are administered too rapidly or over a prolonged period, leading to a significant increase in triglycerides (>1,000 mg/dL) and overwhelming the reticuloendothelial system. The classic triad of Lipid Overload Syndrome includes fever, splenomegaly/hepatomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. The provided exhibits show elevated triglycerides (1,150 mg/dL), low platelets (54,000), fever (102.2°F), and enlarged spleen and liver.",
