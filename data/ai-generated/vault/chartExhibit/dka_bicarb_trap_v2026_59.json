    "correct": "The client is experiencing **Paradoxical CSF Acidosis (a1)**. When IV bicarbonate is administered, it buffers the blood, but the chemical reaction produces CO2. CO2 is highly diffusible and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Inside the brain, the CO2 reacts with water to form H+ (acid). Because bicarbonate (the buffer) is less permeable and crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, the **brain becomes more acidic** even as the blood becomes more alkaline. This phenomenon is why sodium bicarbonate is rarely recommended in DKA unless the pH is < 6.9. The provided exhibits show the CSF pH worsening while the serum pH improves.",
