        "correct": "The client is experiencing **Paradoxical CSF Acidosis (a1)**. When IV Bicarbonate is given, it buffers the blood, but the chemical reaction produces CO2. CO2 is 'fat-soluble' and crosses the blood-brain barrier immediately. Inside the brain, the CO2 reacts with water to form H+ (acid). Because Bicarbonate (the buffer) is 'water-soluble' and crosses slowly, the **brain becomes more acidic** even as the blood becomes more alkaline. This is why Sodium Bicarbonate is rarely recommended in DKA unless the pH is < 6.9.",
