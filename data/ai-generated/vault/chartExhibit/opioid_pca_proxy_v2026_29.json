This is a critical safety violation; the principle of PCA is that the *patient* only receives a dose when *alert* enough to trigger it. If someone else pushes it while the patient is asleep, the natural 'safety stop' (sedation) is bypassed, leading to respiratory depression. While the pump log also shows a 'technical error' (a2), the clinical history of unauthorized button-pushing is the primary human-factor failure and the MOST LIKELY cause given the information provided.",
