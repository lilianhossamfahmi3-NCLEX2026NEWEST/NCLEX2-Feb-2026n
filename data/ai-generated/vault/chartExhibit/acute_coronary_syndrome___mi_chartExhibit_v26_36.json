            "optionA": "Administering morphine sulfate is appropriate for managing pain and reducing myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload and afterload. Morphine also helps alleviate anxiety associated with chest pain.",
            "optionB": "Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of further thrombus formation and propagation of the existing clot. It is a crucial component of immediate MI management.",
            "optionC": "Administering oxygen is essential to increase oxygen availability to the ischemic myocardium and improve tissue oxygenation.",
            "optionD": "Nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the ischemic area and reducing chest pain. It also reduces preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand.",
            "optionE": "Monitoring the ECG for ST-segment changes is critical to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to detect any further myocardial injury or ischemia. ST-segment elevation or depression indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia.",
            "optionF": "Obtaining serum cardiac enzyme levels, such as troponin, is important to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and to assess the extent of myocardial damage. Elevated troponin levels are indicative of myocardial cell death.",
            "incorrect1": "While obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important, it's already performed and should not be repeated without a specific indication. The nurse should not unnecessarily delay interventions.",
            "incorrect2": "Atropine is used to treat symptomatic bradycardia. In the context of acute MI, it is not routinely administered unless the patient is experiencing significant bradycardia causing hemodynamic instability.",
            "incorrect3": "While continuous telemetry monitoring is essential, this is already in place as the patient is in the cardiac unit. Selecting this option indicates a failure to prioritize immediate interventions.",
            "incorrect4": "While documenting baseline assessment is important, more immediate interventions are necessary to stabilize the patient during an acute MI. Documentation should not delay critical interventions.",
            "incorrect5": "A fluid bolus is not typically indicated in the initial management of acute MI unless the patient presents with signs of hypovolemia or hypotension unrelated to the MI itself. A fluid bolus could exacerbate pulmonary congestion.",
            "incorrect6": "There is no indication that the patient requires immediate intubation based on the provided information. Interventions to improve oxygenation, such as administering oxygen, should be prioritized first."
        },
        "distractorRationale": "The distractor rationales explain why the incorrect interventions are inappropriate or less crucial in the immediate management of a patient experiencing an acute MI.",
        "clinicalPearls": "In acute MI management, 'Time is muscle.' Rapid interventions, such as oxygen administration, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine, along with continuous ECG monitoring and obtaining cardiac enzyme levels, are crucial. Avoid delays in initiating these interventions to minimize myocardial damage.",
        "questionTrap": "The question emphasizes prioritizing immediate interventions to minimize myocardial damage. Students may be tempted to select all assessments or interventions that are commonly performed but are not the highest priority in the acute phase of MI management. Focus on addressing the acute chest pain and myocardial ischemia first.",

Diaphoretic and anxious. History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. \n\nB: Arrived via ambulance from home. Complaining of chest pain for the past hour. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Received aspirin 325 mg en route. \n\nA: Currently on oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula, SpO2 92%. Continuous ECG monitoring in place. Morphine 4 mg IV push given at 06:45 for pain. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual administered at 06:35 and 06:40. Cardiac enzymes ordered, results pending. \n\nR: Continue oxygen, monitor vital signs and ECG changes. Repeat nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain, up to 3 doses. Await cardiac enzyme results. Cardiology consult ordered. Patient education on lifestyle modifications needed. Possible transfer to cath lab for PCI.",
