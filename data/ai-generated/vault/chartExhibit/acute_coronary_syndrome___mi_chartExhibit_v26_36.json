        "optionA": "Administering morphine sulfate is appropriate for managing pain and reducing myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload and afterload. Morphine also helps alleviate anxiety associated with chest pain. It is typically administered in small, incremental doses to avoid respiratory depression and hypotension. clinicalPearl: Monitor respiratory rate and blood pressure closely after administration.",
        "optionB": "Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of further thrombus formation and propagation of the existing clot. It is a crucial component of immediate MI management. Aspirin should be administered as soon as possible unless contraindicated. clinicalPearl: Ensure the patient chews the aspirin for faster absorption.",
        "optionC": "Administering oxygen is essential to increase oxygen availability to the ischemic myocardium and improve tissue oxygenation. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90%. clinicalPearl: Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust the oxygen flow rate accordingly.",
        "optionD": "Nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the ischemic area and reducing chest pain. It also reduces preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Nitroglycerin is typically administered sublingually or intravenously. clinicalPearl: Monitor blood pressure closely after administration, as it can cause hypotension.",
        "optionE": "Monitoring the ECG for ST-segment changes is critical to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to detect any further myocardial injury or ischemia. ST-segment elevation or depression indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia. clinicalPearl: Continuously monitor the ECG and be prepared to respond to any changes.",
        "optionF": "Obtaining serum cardiac enzyme levels, such as troponin, is important to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and to assess the extent of myocardial damage. Elevated troponin levels are indicative of myocardial cell death. clinicalPearl: Serial troponin levels should be obtained to assess the progression of myocardial damage.",
        "incorrect1": "While obtaining a 12-lead ECG is important for initial diagnosis, it's already performed per the SBAR and should not be repeated without a specific indication such as new or worsening chest pain or dysrhythmia. The nurse should not unnecessarily delay interventions. questionTrap: Prioritize interventions based on the patient's current status and avoid repeating already completed tasks.",
        "incorrect2": "Atropine is used to treat symptomatic bradycardia. In the context of acute MI, it is not routinely administered unless the patient is experiencing significant bradycardia causing hemodynamic instability. The patient's heart rate is 110 bpm, so atropine is not indicated. questionTrap: Avoid administering medications without a clear indication based on the patient's current condition.",
        "incorrect3": "While continuous telemetry monitoring is essential, this is already in place as the patient is in the cardiac unit, per the SBAR. Selecting this option indicates a failure to prioritize immediate interventions. questionTrap: Focus on addressing the patient's acute symptoms and avoid selecting interventions that are already in place.",
        "incorrect4": "While documenting baseline assessment is important, more immediate interventions are necessary to stabilize the patient during an acute MI. Documentation should not delay critical interventions. questionTrap: Prioritize interventions based on the patient's immediate needs and avoid delaying critical care for documentation.",
        "incorrect5": "A fluid bolus is not typically indicated in the initial management of acute MI unless the patient presents with signs of hypovolemia or hypotension unrelated to the MI itself. A fluid bolus could exacerbate pulmonary congestion. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, so a fluid bolus is contraindicated. questionTrap: Avoid administering fluids without a clear indication, especially in patients with cardiac compromise.",
        "incorrect6": "There is no indication that the patient requires immediate intubation based on the provided information. The patient's SpO2 is 92% on 2L NC. Interventions to improve oxygenation, such as administering oxygen, should be prioritized first. questionTrap: Avoid unnecessary interventions and prioritize less invasive measures first."

History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n\nB: Arrived via ambulance from home. Complaining of chest pain for the past hour. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Received aspirin 325 mg PO en route.\n\nA: Currently on oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula, SpO2 92%. Continuous ECG monitoring in place. Morphine 4 mg IV push given at 06:45 for pain. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual administered at 06:35 and 06:40. Cardiac enzymes ordered, results pending.\n\nR: Continue oxygen, monitor vital signs and ECG changes. Repeat nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain, up to 3 doses. Await cardiac enzyme results. Cardiology consult ordered. Patient education on lifestyle modifications needed.
