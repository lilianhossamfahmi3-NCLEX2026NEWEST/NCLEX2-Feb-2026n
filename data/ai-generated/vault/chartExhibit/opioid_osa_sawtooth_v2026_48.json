The sawtooth waveform and pauses in breathing with loud snoring indicate a physical obstruction (the tongue/soft tissue falling back) rather than a loss of central respiratory drive. The immediate priority is to open the airway using CPAP and proper positioning. Naloxone is not the first choice because the client's respiratory rate is 12, indicating respiratory drive is present, but the airway is blocked.",
