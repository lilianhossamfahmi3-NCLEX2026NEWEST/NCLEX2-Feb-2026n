The release of cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1) causes fever and chills. Free hemoglobin released from lysed RBCs overwhelms haptoglobin, leading to hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria; this precipitates in the renal tubules, causing acute tubular necrosis and the characteristic flank/back pain.

Fine hand tremors can be a common side effect at therapeutic levels, but the presence of *coarse* tremors, along with ataxia and confusion, is a hallmark of CNS toxicity. Documenting this as therapeutic fails to recognize a life-threatening condition, violates the standard of care, and directly places the client at risk for severe neurological sequelae."

Test-takers often correctly recall the inverse relationship between sodium and lithium levels (low sodium can lead to high lithium). However, they misapply this preventative principle to an acute toxicity scenario. While maintaining sodium balance is key for long-term management, it is an ineffective and dangerously slow intervention for a patient with established, symptomatic toxicity. The immediate priority is always to stop the offending agent and initiate emergency medical treatment."

The data trend represents Cushing's Triad, a late and ominous sign of severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) causing brainstem compression. **Pathophysiology**: 1) **Hypertension with Widening Pulse Pressure**: As ICP rises, it compresses cerebral arteries, leading to cerebral ischemia. The brain's vasomotor center triggers a massive sympathetic response to increase systemic blood pressure, specifically systolic, to overcome the ICP and restore cerebral perfusion (CPP = MAP - ICP). This results in severe hypertension. 2) **Bradycardia**: The intense systemic hypertension is detected by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, which then trigger a powerful reflexive vagal (parasympathetic) stimulation to the heart, causing a drop in heart rate. 3) **Irregular Respirations**: The increasing pressure directly compresses the respiratory control centers in the medulla and pons, leading to dysfunctional breathing patterns like Cheyne-Stokes, indicating imminent brain herniation."
