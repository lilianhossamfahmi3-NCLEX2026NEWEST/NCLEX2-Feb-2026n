The hallmark findings are a **new holosystolic murmur** at the **left lower sternal border (LLSB)** with a **thrill**, and echocardiographic confirmation of a **left-to-right shunt**. This causes sudden right-heart overload and cardiogenic shock. Mitral regurgitation (a2) from papillary muscle rupture would have a similar murmur but would be heard at the *apex* and radiate to the axilla. Hypotension and muffled heart sounds (a3) are indicative of cardiac tamponade. A pericardial friction rub (a4) is associated with pericarditis.",
