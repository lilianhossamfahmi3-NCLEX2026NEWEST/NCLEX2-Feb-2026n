Background: He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, managed with oral medications. He presented with decreased urine output and increased thirst. Assessment: At 07:00, patient reports generalized weakness and nausea. BP is 170/98 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 24, and SpO2 94% on room air. He appears lethargic. Urine output has been less than 30 mL/hr for the past 6 hours. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. Recent labs show elevated creatinine and potassium levels. Recommendation: I recommend immediate intervention to address the hyperkalemia and fluid overload, including continuous cardiac monitoring, possible dialysis, and adjustments to his medication regimen. Please evaluate urgently.",
