In other shocks, the body compensates for low pressure by increasing the heart rate (Tachycardia). However, in a T6+ spinal injury, the sympathetic 'fight or flight' signals are cut off, leaving the heart 'disconnected' and unable to speed up, while the vessels dilate (leading to **pink, warm, dry skin**).",
