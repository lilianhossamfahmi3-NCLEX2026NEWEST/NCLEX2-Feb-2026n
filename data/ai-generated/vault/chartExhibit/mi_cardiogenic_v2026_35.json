    "correct": "The correct answer is **(a1)**. Cardiogenic shock, a form of pump failure, is characterized by a **low cardiac output/index** (CI 1.6 L/min/m²) accompanied by **high filling pressures** (PCWP 24 mmHg). In other forms of shock, such as hypovolemic shock, the CI is low, but the PCWP is also low. In cardiogenic shock, the heart's inability to pump effectively causes blood to back up into the lungs (resulting in high PCWP and crackles) while systemic circulation fails (low CI, narrow pulse pressure, cold skin).",
