Biphasic reactions occur in up to 20% of anaphylaxis cases where symptoms return after a period of stable recovery (often hours later). This occurs because the initial inflammatory mediators were suppressed but not fully eliminated, leading to a 'second wave' of histamine release. This is why patients must be monitored for 6-12 hours after an anaphylactic event, even if they feel fine.",
