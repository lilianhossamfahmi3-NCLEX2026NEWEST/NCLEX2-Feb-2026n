In central DI, administering vasopressin (ADH) resolves the issue because the brain was not producing it. However, in nephrogenic DI (often caused by lithium-induced damage to the renal tubules), the kidneys are resistant to ADH. Therefore, administering external vasopressin does not concentrate the urine (specific gravity remains < 1.005). The history of 15 years of lithium use is the primary risk factor.",
