While sinus bradycardia (a2) is common in anorexia as the body attempts to conserve energy, the development of **Mobitz II Second-Degree Heart Block** (a1) is a critical failure of the heart's conduction system, often caused by severe electrolyte imbalances (Low K+, Low Mag) and myocardial atrophy. Mobitz II frequently progresses to Third-Degree (Complete) heart block or asystole. This requires telemetry and likely a temporary pacemaker, which cannot be managed on a general behavioral health unit.",
