    "correct": "The evolution to second-degree heart block (Mobitz II) is a **High-Risk Cardiac Event (a1)**. While sinus bradycardia (a2) is common in anorexia as the body attempts to conserve energy, Mobitz II indicates a critical failure of the heart's conduction system, often caused by severe electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, low magnesium) and myocardial atrophy. Mobitz II frequently progresses to third-degree (complete) heart block or asystole. This requires telemetry and likely a temporary pacemaker, which cannot be managed on a general behavioral health unit.",

      "In anorexia, the heart atrophies, making it prone to failure.",
      "The refeeding phase often worsens these cardiac issues due to magnesium shifts.",
