Hyperkalemia (the 'K' in AEIOU) that causes cardiac instability (widened QRS complex) is the highest priority for emergent hemodialysis, as the client is at immediate risk for ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Acidosis (a3) and volume overload (a4) are also indications, but they are generally less immediately fatal than a cardiac arrest triggered by hyperkalemia.",
