This infant's drop from the 50th to the 10th percentile meets this criterion. Pathophysiologically, in states of inadequate caloric intake, the body first catabolizes glycogen and adipose tissue for energy, leading to a rapid decrease in weight.

Here, the length percentile has only minimally decreased (50th to 40th), while the weight has plummeted (50th to 10th). Therefore, the weight trend is the most acute and concerning finding."
