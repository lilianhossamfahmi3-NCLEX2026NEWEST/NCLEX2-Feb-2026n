This indicates a potential arterial hemorrhage and/or a massive clot obstruction of the 3-way catheter. Unlike 'Light Pink' (expected) or 'Bright Red' (venous oozing), burgundy/dark red urine with a stop in flow suggests the bladder is filling with blood and clots, leading to potential bladder rupture or hemorrhagic shock. The tachycardia (118 bpm) and diaphoresis further support active bleeding (shock).",
