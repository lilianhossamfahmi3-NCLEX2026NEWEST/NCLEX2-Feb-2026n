He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.\n**Background:** He has a history of hypertension and COPD. Initial ABGs showed severe hypoxemia despite high FiO2. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. He has been on continuous propofol and cisatracurium infusions.\n**Assessment (07:00):** Currently, his vital signs are: HR 110, BP 150/90, RR 20 (ventilator-controlled), SpO2 88% on FiO2 0.70, PEEP 10 cm H2O. He has decreased breath sounds bilaterally with coarse crackles. ETCO2 is trending up. Peak inspiratory pressure is 35 cm H2O. Urine output is adequate. He is on continuous enteral feeds. Sputum is yellow and thick.\n**Recommendation (07:00):** I recommend we consider increasing PEEP and prone positioning to improve oxygenation. Also, assess for any signs of VAP and obtain a sputum culture. Adjust sedation as needed. Evaluate the need for further fluid management.",

        "correct": "ARDS causes significant ventilation-perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting, leading to refractory hypoxemia. 'Compromised Gas Exchange' is directly related to these pathophysiological changes. 'Maintain PEEP at prescribed level' increases alveolar recruitment and prevents alveolar collapse, improving oxygenation and reducing intrapulmonary shunting. 'Monitor for signs of barotrauma' is critical because high PEEP levels can lead to alveolar rupture and pneumothorax, especially in ARDS patients with already compromised lung compliance. 'Risk for Infection' is a major concern due to the client's immunocompromised state and invasive interventions. 'Provide frequent skin care' minimizes pressure ulcer risk, a common complication in critically ill, immobilized patients. 'Elevate head of bed 30-45 degrees' reduces the risk of aspiration and VAP. 'Ineffective Airway Clearance' can occur due to increased secretions and impaired cough reflex. Elevating the head of bed and monitoring for barotrauma are key. Barotrauma could lead to pneumothorax, causing worsening respiratory status and ineffective clearance.",
