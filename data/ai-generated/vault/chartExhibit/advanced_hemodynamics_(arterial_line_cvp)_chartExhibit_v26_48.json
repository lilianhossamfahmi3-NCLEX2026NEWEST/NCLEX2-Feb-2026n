    "stem": "A 68-year-old male patient is 2 days post-operative from a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He is in the ICU and has an arterial line and central venous pressure (CVP) catheter in place. Review the available patient information, and answer the questions that follow.",

      "SBAR": "14:00 Report:\nSituation: Mr. Johnson is experiencing increasing shortness of breath and decreased urine output.\nBackground: He underwent CABG two days ago. His post-operative course was initially uneventful. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with medications.\nAssessment: BP is 90/50 mmHg via arterial line, HR is 110 bpm and regular, CVP is 18 mmHg, and SpO2 is 91% on 40% FiO2 via nasal cannula. Breath sounds reveal crackles bilaterally in the lower lobes. Urine output has been 20 mL over the past hour. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Chest x-ray shows possible pulmonary congestion. The patient is on continuous cardiac monitoring. Incision site is clean, dry, and intact.\nRecommendation: I recommend stat portable chest x-ray, assess ABGs, notify the physician, and consider increasing FiO2. We need to evaluate for potential causes of his hemodynamic instability, such as cardiac tamponade, fluid overload, or acute kidney injury. Evaluate renal function.",
