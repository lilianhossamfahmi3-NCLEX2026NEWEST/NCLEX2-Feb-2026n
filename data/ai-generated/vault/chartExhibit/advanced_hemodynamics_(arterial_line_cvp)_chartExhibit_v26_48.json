Initial post-op was stable. History includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, managed with medications. No known allergies.\nAssessment: BP 90/50 mmHg (arterial line), HR 110 bpm (regular), CVP 18 mmHg. SpO2 91% on 40% FiO2 via nasal cannula. RR 26 and labored. Breath sounds: crackles bilaterally in lower lobes. Urine output: 20 mL/hr. Patient anxious and diaphoretic. Chest x-ray shows possible pulmonary congestion. Incision site clean, dry, intact.\nRecommendation: Stat portable chest x-ray, ABGs, and notify the physician. Consider increasing FiO2 and evaluating for cardiac tamponade, fluid overload, or acute kidney injury. Assess renal function and consider a fluid challenge.",
