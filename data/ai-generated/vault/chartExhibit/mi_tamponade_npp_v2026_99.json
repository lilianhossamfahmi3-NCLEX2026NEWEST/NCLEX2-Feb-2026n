While Muffled Heart Sounds and JVD are part of Beck's Triad, the **Narrowing Pulse Pressure (a1)** is one of the most critical and earliest hemodynamic shifts. As fluid fills the pericardium, it 'crushes' the heart, preventing the ventricles from filling (reducing SBP) and increasing the base pressure (maintaining DBP). This brings the two numbers closer and closer (104/86 -> 82/78). If the pulse pressure becomes zero, the heart cannot pump at all.",
