Key findings supporting this diagnosis include **low serum osmolality and sodium** (262 mOsm/kg and 122 mEq/L, respectively) coupled with **high urine osmolality and specific gravity** (850 mOsm/kg and 1.034, respectively). These values indicate that the body is retaining excessive water, leading to dilution of sodium in the blood and concentration of urine. In Diabetes Insipidus (DI) (a2), the opposite would be observed: high serum sodium and dilute urine. The client's confusion and headache are likely due to cerebral edema resulting from hyponatremia.",
