The hallmark cues are **Severe Hypothermia** (94.2°F) and **Severe Hyponatremia** (114 mEq/L), which along with bradycardia and stupor, distinguish it from simple hypothyroidism. Hyponatremia occurs because the lack of thyroid hormone leads to a form of SIADH (water retention). This is a fatal condition that requires IV Levothyroxine and potentially IV steroids (to prevent adrenal crisis).",
