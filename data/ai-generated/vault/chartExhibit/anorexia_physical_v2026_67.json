When there is no body fat left for insulation, the body grows fine, downy hair (lanugo) to try and trap heat. Acrocyanosis (blue extremities) and bradycardia occur as the body prioritizes blood flow to the core and slows down the metabolic 'engine' to prevent death. Hypothermia is a direct result of decreased metabolic activity and lack of insulation. This is a compensatory metabolic shift rather than a primary heart or endocrine disease.",
