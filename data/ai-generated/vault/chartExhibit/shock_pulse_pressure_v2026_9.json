As the body attempts to compensate, the diastolic pressure rises (due to vasoconstriction) and the systolic pressure falls (due to blood loss), causing the gap (pulse pressure) to narrow. A pulse pressure < 25 mmHg indicates severe reduction in cardiac output before a massive drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurs.",
