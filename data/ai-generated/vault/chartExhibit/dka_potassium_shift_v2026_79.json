However, IV insulin facilitates potassium's movement from the extracellular space (blood) into the intracellular space (cells). This can lead to a rapid decrease in serum potassium levels. The **U-waves** on the EKG (1215) are indicative of hypokalemia. Potassium supplementation is crucial to prevent potentially lethal arrhythmias.",
