This happens because the 'pipes' (vessels) are blocked, but the 'balloons' (alveoli) are still empty and clear of fluid. If it were pneumonia or heart failure, you would hear crackles or wheezes. The calf size difference (a4) is a cue for a DVT, which *leads* to a PE, but the 'Mismatch' confirms the pulmonary event.",
