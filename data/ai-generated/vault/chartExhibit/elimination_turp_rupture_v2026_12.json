    "correct": "The most likely and severe complication is **Bladder Rupture (a1)**. The I&O log shows a 'negative' net output (more fluid going IN than coming OUT), meaning the irrigant is being retained. However, the 'Rigid, board-like abdomen' and 'rebound tenderness' are hallmark signs of peritonitis, which occurs when a full bladder ruptures and leaks urine/irrigant into the sterile peritoneal cavity. If it were a simple clot (a2), the abdomen might be distended/painful, but it wouldn't be rigid and board-like (a peritoneal sign).",

      "a2": "While catheter obstruction is a common post-TURP complication, the presence of a rigid, board-like abdomen and rebound tenderness strongly suggests peritonitis due to bladder rupture, not just a simple obstruction.",
