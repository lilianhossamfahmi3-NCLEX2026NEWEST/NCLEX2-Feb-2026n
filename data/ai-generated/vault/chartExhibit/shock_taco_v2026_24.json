Key indicators are the elevated CVP (18 mmHg), the sudden hypertension (168/98 mmHg), the presence of an S3 heart sound, and the significant increase in BNP (from 400 to 4200 pg/mL). In a patient with pre-existing heart failure, the rapid volume expansion from MTP has caused the heart to 'fail forward,' leading to pulmonary edema. The priority is to stop the volume overload and remove the excess fluid with a diuretic like Furosemide.",
