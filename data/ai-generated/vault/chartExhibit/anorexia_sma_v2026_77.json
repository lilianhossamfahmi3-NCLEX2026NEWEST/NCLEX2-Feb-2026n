    "correct": "The most likely cause is **Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome (a1)**. In patients with rapid weight loss, the mesenteric fat pad that normally separates the SMA from the duodenum can diminish. This can lead to compression of the duodenum between the SMA and the aorta, causing a mechanical obstruction. This obstruction results in postprandial abdominal pain and vomiting, which can be relieved by positions (such as the fetal or prone position) that reduce the compression.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "SMA Syndrome is often associated with significant weight loss and decreased mesenteric fat.",
      "A classic sign is relief of pain when lying prone or in the left lateral decubitus position.",
      "Treatment includes small, frequent meals, high-calorie nutrition (often via nasojejunal tube to bypass the obstruction), and potentially surgical intervention to release the compression."

      "howToOvercome": "While psychological factors can contribute to vomiting in anorexia nervosa, the imaging findings (Aorta-SMA angle < 25 degrees) and positional relief of pain strongly suggest a mechanical obstruction. Consider structural causes when physical findings support them."
