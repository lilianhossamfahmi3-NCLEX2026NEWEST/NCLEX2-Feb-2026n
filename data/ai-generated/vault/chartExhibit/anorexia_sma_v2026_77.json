When a patient loses weight too rapidly, the 'fat pad' that normally keeps the SMA artery away from the duodenum disappears. The artery then 'pinches' the duodenum against the aorta, effectively creating a physical wall that food cannot pass. This causes vomiting, post-prandial pain, and is uniquely relieved by positions (like fetal or prone) that 'swing' the artery forward. This is a common and often missed complication of extreme anorexia.",
