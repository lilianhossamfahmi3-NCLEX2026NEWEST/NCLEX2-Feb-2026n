Second, the chart indicates the 20/200 acuity is *with corrective lenses*. Simple myopia is typically correctable to 20/20 or better.

Therefore, 20/200 signifies a severe impairment in the eye's ability to resolve detail. This can be due to a refractive error (light not focusing on the retina) or a structural/neurological pathology affecting the cornea, lens, retina, or optic nerve. The legal definition of 20/200 is a public health standard established to identify individuals whose visual impairment is severe enough to substantially limit major life activities, creating significant safety risks (e.g., driving) and qualifying them for disability accommodations and services.",

The FACES scale translates the internal sensory and emotional experience of pain into concrete, relatable images, providing a more accurate self-report. A score of '6' indicates significant activation of nociceptive pathways, triggering a sympathetic nervous system response (e.g., increased heart rate, blood pressure) and release of cortisol.

Pathophysiologically, purulent exudate is composed of neutrophils, cellular debris, and bacteria, indicating an active infectious process. The transition to scant serous exudate (clear plasma filtrate) signifies a dramatic reduction in bacterial bioburden and the resolution of the inflammatory phase, allowing the proliferative phase of healing to begin. This is further supported by the reduction in all three wound dimensions (L x W x D), which indicates granulation tissue deposition and wound contraction."
