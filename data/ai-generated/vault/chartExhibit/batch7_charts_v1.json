The Aldrete score assesses five key areas: activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation. A score of 2 in each category signifies optimal function. Full motor activity indicates reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Deep breaths and coughing demonstrate adequate respiratory function and airway protection. Blood pressure within 20% of pre-operative baseline reflects hemodynamic stability. Being fully awake indicates adequate neurological recovery. Oxygen saturation >92% on room air confirms sufficient gas exchange. This combination of factors demonstrates the client's ability to maintain vital functions independently and safely progress to the next phase of recovery.",

The Aldrete score is designed to quantify the reversal of these effects. For example, anesthetic agents can cause vasodilation, leading to hypotension. They can also depress the respiratory center in the brain, leading to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blocking agents can cause muscle weakness, affecting motor function and respiratory effort. The Aldrete score ensures these functions have returned to a safe baseline before discharge.",

This client has met all criteria for progression of care and does not require continued intense monitoring.",
                "pathophysiology": "Lower Aldrete scores often reflect the lingering effects of anesthetic agents on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system. For instance, residual anesthetic drugs can depress the medullary respiratory center, leading to decreased respiratory rate and tidal volume. This can result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Similarly, vasodilation caused by anesthetic agents can lead to decreased blood pressure and reduced tissue perfusion.",

Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analog that mimics the body's natural prandial insulin release. It facilitates glucose uptake into cells, primarily muscle and adipose tissue, by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane. This action reduces postprandial hyperglycemia, preventing glucotoxicity and mitigating the risk of microvascular complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.",

This can result in increased glycosuria, osmotic diuresis, and dehydration.

Because the brain relies primarily on glucose for energy, severe or prolonged hypoglycemia can result in irreversible brain damage or death.

In addition, the client may experience symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as polyuria, polydipsia, and blurred vision.

Atelectasis, the collapse of alveoli, and pneumonia are common post-operative complications. Shallow breathing, often due to pain (splinting), reduces tidal volume and functional residual capacity, leading to alveolar collapse, especially at the lung bases. Incentive spirometry promotes sustained maximal inspiration (SMI), generating negative intrapleural pressure. This re-inflates collapsed alveoli and stimulates surfactant production, preventing further collapse. By keeping alveoli open and promoting secretion mobilization via the mucociliary escalator, it prevents fluid stasis, reducing the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia. **Clinical Pearl:** Encourage patients to perform incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake.

The audiogram shows a bilateral, symmetrical, sloping high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (worse in the left ear shown), with relatively normal hearing in the low frequencies.

The audiogram in the exhibit shows a progressive downward slope, not a 4000 Hz notch. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is a common symptom of NIHL, but the audiogram pattern is not consistent with this diagnosis."
