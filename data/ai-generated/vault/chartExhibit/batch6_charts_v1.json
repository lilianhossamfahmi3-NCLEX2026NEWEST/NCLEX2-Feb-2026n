Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, initiates cervical ripening by inducing collagenase activity, which breaks down the collagen matrix. It also increases the levels of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans, causing an influx of water that softens the cervix and promotes effacement. This pharmacological intervention is the necessary first step to biochemically remodel the cervix, making it more receptive to the mechanical forces of uterine contractions that will be stimulated later."

Oxytocin stimulates myometrial contractions but has no direct ripening effect on the cervix's collagen structure. Initiating strong contractions against a firm, closed cervix leads to hypertonic uterine dysfunction, where contractions are strong but fail to produce cervical change. This can cause maternal exhaustion and, more critically, compromise fetal oxygenation by compressing uteroplacental arteries without the progression of labor. This path significantly increases the likelihood of a failed induction requiring a cesarean section."

The umbilical cord can be swept down by the gush of fluid, becoming compressed between the fetal head and the maternal pelvis.
