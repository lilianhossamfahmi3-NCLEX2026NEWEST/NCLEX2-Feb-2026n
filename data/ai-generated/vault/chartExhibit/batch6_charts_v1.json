The donor blood, being Type A, has A-antigens on its RBC surfaces. Upon infusion, the recipient's Anti-A IgM antibodies would immediately bind to the donor's A-antigens. This antigen-antibody complex activates the classical complement pathway, forming a membrane attack complex (MAC) that perforates the donor RBCs, causing massive intravascular hemolysis. This releases large amounts of free hemoglobin into the plasma, which is nephrotoxic and leads to acute tubular necrosis. The cellular debris also activates the coagulation cascade, potentially leading to DIC. The inflammatory response also triggers the release of vasoactive substances, leading to hypotension and shock.",

The universal recipient is **AB**-positive, as they can accept from **A**ny**B**ody. 3. **STOP**: **S**top the transfusion, **T**ake vitals, **O**pen a new saline line, **P**hone the provider and blood bank.

If a transfusion reaction is suspected, stop the transfusion immediately and follow institutional protocols. Proper blood product verification is a critical nursing responsibility.

Uterine atony occurs when the myometrium fails to maintain this contraction. A boggy uterus signifies muscle relaxation, leading to uncompressed blood vessels and rapid blood loss.\n\n**Fundal massage** provides direct mechanical stimulation, prompting the myometrium to contract. This stimulates the release of local prostaglandins, further enhancing uterine tone and compressing the bleeding vessels. Effective massage can rapidly reduce blood loss and prevent hypovolemic shock.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Fundal massage is an independent nursing intervention and the *first* action to take in this scenario.
