The client with Type O blood lacks A and B antigens on their RBCs but possesses circulating pre-formed IgM antibodies, specifically Anti-A and Anti-B. The donor blood, being Type A, has A-antigens on its RBC surfaces. Upon infusion, the recipient's Anti-A IgM antibodies would immediately bind to the donor's A-antigens. This antigen-antibody complex activates the classical complement pathway, forming a membrane attack complex (MAC) that perforates the donor RBCs, causing massive intravascular hemolysis. This releases large amounts of free hemoglobin into the plasma, which is nephrotoxic and leads to acute tubular necrosis. The cellular debris also activates the coagulation cascade, potentially leading to DIC. The inflammatory response also triggers the release of vasoactive substances, leading to hypotension and shock.",

Lastly, some may confuse this severe incompatibility with a minor allergic reaction, incorrectly choosing the premedication option (diphenhydramine).",

Patients with Type O blood have 'zero' A or B antigens on their RBCs, so their immune system will attack any A or B antigens it sees. They can only receive 'O' blood. 2. **Universal Donor/Recipient**: The universal d**O**n**O**r is **O**-negative. The universal recipient is **AB**-positive, as they can accept from **A**ny**B**ody. 3. **STOP**: **S**top the transfusion, **T**ake vitals, **O**pen a new saline line, **P**hone the provider and blood bank.

The assessment at 1015 reveals a boggy uterus and saturated pad within 15 minutes, indicating likely uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).\n\n**Pathophysiology:** After placental expulsion, the myometrium (uterine muscle) should contract firmly, compressing the spiral arteries at the placental site to prevent excessive bleeding. These muscle fibers act as 'living ligatures'. Uterine atony occurs when the myometrium fails to maintain this contraction. Risk factors include multiparity, prolonged labor, overdistended uterus (polyhydramnios, macrosomia), and use of magnesium sulfate. A boggy uterus signifies muscle relaxation, leading to uncompressed blood vessels and rapid blood loss.\n\n**Fundal massage** provides direct mechanical stimulation, prompting the myometrium to contract. This stimulates the release of local prostaglandins, further enhancing uterine tone and compressing the bleeding vessels. Effective massage can rapidly reduce blood loss and prevent hypovolemic shock.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Fundal massage is an independent nursing intervention and the *first* action to take in this scenario. Continuous assessment of uterine tone and lochia is crucial in the immediate postpartum period.",

This allows the provider to order further interventions, such as uterotonic medications (oxytocin, methylergonovine, carboprost) or blood transfusions.\n\n**Clinical Pearl:** Remember to act first, then delegate/collaborate.
