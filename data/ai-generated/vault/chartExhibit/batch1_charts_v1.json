While post-operative stress can be a trigger, the client's symptom of 'sharp' chest pain is atypical for MI, which classically presents as crushing, substernal pressure that may radiate. The primary pathology is a cardiac pump problem, whereas the client's sudden hypoxemia points more directly to a gas exchange failure in the lungs. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** MI occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. This leads to ischemia and potential infarction. The pain is typically due to the buildup of metabolic byproducts and stimulation of nerve endings in the ischemic tissue."

The client's total hip arthroplasty is a major risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to Virchow's triad: venous stasis from immobility, hypercoagulability from the surgical stress response, and endothelial injury to vessels during surgery. A dislodged thrombus can travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). The embolus obstructs pulmonary arteries, creating a profound ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch where alveoli are ventilated but not perfused. This blockage directly causes the sudden-onset hypoxemia (SpO2 89%), while the body's compensatory response to decreased cardiac output and hypoxemia results in tachycardia (118 bpm) and tachypnea (28/min). The sharp, pleuritic chest pain is caused by irritation of the parietal pleura from the nearby infarction or inflammatory response. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** A PE obstructs pulmonary blood flow, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular afterload. This can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and decreased cardiac output. The V/Q mismatch results in hypoxemia because blood is flowing past alveoli that are not adequately ventilated. The pleuritic chest pain arises from inflammation and irritation of the pleura due to pulmonary infarction or ischemia."

The pathophysiology involves microbial invasion leading to alveolar consolidation with purulent exudate. This process would likely be accompanied by fever, productive cough, and crackles on auscultation, none of which are documented for this client. The abrupt nature of the decompensation makes an infectious process less likely than an embolic event. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Pneumonia involves inflammation and consolidation of lung tissue due to infection. This impairs gas exchange by reducing the surface area available for oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion. The inflammatory response also leads to increased mucus production and airway obstruction."

Atelectasis typically presents with diminished breath sounds and possibly a low-grade fever. The client's presentation indicates a more catastrophic and acute vascular event. **Pathophysiology Rationale:** Atelectasis occurs when alveoli collapse, reducing the surface area for gas exchange.
