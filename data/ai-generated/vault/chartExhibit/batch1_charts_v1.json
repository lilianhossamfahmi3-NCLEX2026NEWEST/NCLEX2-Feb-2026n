This directly explains the client's irregular tachycardia (HR 112).

The client's total hip arthroplasty is a major risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to Virchow's triad: venous stasis from immobility, hypercoagulability from the surgical stress response, and endothelial injury to vessels during surgery. A dislodged thrombus can travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). The embolus obstructs pulmonary arteries, creating a profound ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch where alveoli are ventilated but not perfused. This blockage directly causes the sudden-onset hypoxemia (SpO2 89%), while the body's compensatory response to decreased cardiac output and hypoxemia results in tachycardia (118 bpm) and tachypnea (28/min). The sharp, pleuritic chest pain is caused by irritation of the parietal pleura from the nearby infarction or inflammatory response."
