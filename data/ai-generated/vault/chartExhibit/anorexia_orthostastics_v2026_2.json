A heart rate dropping significantly upon standing (from 40 to 32) and a systolic BP of 72 represent a failure of the autonomic nervous system to compensate, placing the client at high risk for syncope and cardiac arrest. Strict bed rest is mandatory until the client is stabilized via rehydration and nutritional support.",
