The significant drop in heart rate upon standing (from 40 to 32 bpm) and a systolic blood pressure of 72 mmHg indicate a failure of the autonomic nervous system to compensate, placing the client at high risk for syncope and cardiac arrest. Strict bed rest is essential until the client is stabilized through rehydration and nutritional support. Notifying the provider is crucial for further intervention.",
