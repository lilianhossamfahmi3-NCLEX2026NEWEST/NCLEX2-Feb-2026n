It occurs because the recipient has pre-existing antibodies that immediately attack the donor organ, causing massive thrombosis (clotting) and cyanosis (blue color) of the graft. The sudden stop in urine, the high fever (102.4), and the painful, firm kidney are classic signs. The only treatment is **immediate removal** of the transplanted kidney.",
