  "rationale": {
    "correct": "The correct answer is **Sudden anuria, fever, and a painful, firm kidney (a1)**. Hyperacute rejection occurs **within minutes to hours** of transplantation due to pre-existing antibodies in the recipient that attack the donor organ. This leads to thrombosis and cyanosis of the graft, resulting in a sudden cessation of urine output, fever, and a painful, firm kidney. Immediate removal of the transplanted kidney is often necessary.",
    "clinicalPearls": [
      "Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to hours due to pre-existing antibodies and requires immediate removal of the organ.",
      "Acute rejection typically occurs within 1 week to 3 months and is a cellular response that can be managed with immunosuppressants.",
      "Chronic rejection occurs months to years after transplantation due to scarring and often leads to a return to dialysis.",
