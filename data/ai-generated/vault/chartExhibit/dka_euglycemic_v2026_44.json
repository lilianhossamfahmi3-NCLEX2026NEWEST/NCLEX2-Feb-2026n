This is a rare form of DKA where the blood glucose is typically < 250 mg/dL (here it is 168 mg/dL), but the patient is in severe metabolic acidosis with high ketones and a high anion gap. This is a known risk for patients taking **SGLT2 inhibitors** (like Empagliflozin), as these drugs increase glucose excretion in the urine, potentially masking hyperglycemia even while the body is producing ketones due to a catabolic state. The recent gastroenteritis and decreased oral intake likely exacerbated this condition.",
