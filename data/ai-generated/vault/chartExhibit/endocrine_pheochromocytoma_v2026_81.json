    "correct": "The correct answer is **a1**. A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla. The most critical indicator of a crisis is the **sudden, severe hypertension** triggered by **abdominal palpation**. Palpation can physically stimulate the tumor, causing a massive release of catecholamines. This represents a significant safety risk. Abdominal palpation should be avoided in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma.",
