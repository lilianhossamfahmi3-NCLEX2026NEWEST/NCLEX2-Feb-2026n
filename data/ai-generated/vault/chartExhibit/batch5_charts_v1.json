The immune system produces IgG antibodies against this heparin-PF4 complex. These antibodies bind to the complex on the platelet surface, causing widespread platelet activation and aggregation. This leads to rapid clearance of platelets by the reticuloendothelial system (causing thrombocytopenia) and, paradoxically, a severe prothrombotic state due to the release of procoagulant microparticles. **Clinical Pearl:** Rapid-onset HIT (within 24 hours) can occur in patients with prior heparin exposure.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic emergency caused by the rapid breakdown of cancer cells, releasing intracellular components into the bloodstream.

Elevated potassium levels can cause life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, including peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and ultimately cardiac arrest. Hyperuricemia (Uric Acid 12 mg/dL) occurs as nucleic acids are metabolized to uric acid, which can precipitate in the renal tubules, leading to acute kidney injury and potential renal failure. Hyperphosphatemia (Phosphorus 5.5 mg/dL) results from the release of intracellular phosphate. The excess phosphate binds to serum calcium, causing secondary hypocalcemia (Calcium 7.0 mg/dL). Hypocalcemia can manifest as tetany, seizures, prolonged QT interval, and cardiac arrhythmias. Prompt recognition and management are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.

        "content": "Correct. At 1400, the client's GCS score is calculated by summing the best response in each category: Eye Opening (2) + Verbal Response (2) + Motor Response (4) = 8. A score of 8 indicates a severe brain injury and is a critical clinical threshold. \n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* The rapid decline from a GCS of 15 at 1000 to 8 at 1400 suggests escalating intracranial pressure (ICP) from a mechanism like an expanding hematoma (epidural or subdural) or severe cerebral edema. This increased pressure compresses brain structures, particularly the reticular activating system (RAS) in the brainstem, which is responsible for maintaining consciousness. Compression of the RAS leads to the observed decreased level of responsiveness. A GCS of 8 or less signifies that the client is unable to maintain a patent airway due to impaired protective reflexes (cough, gag), necessitating immediate consideration for endotracheal intubation to prevent aspiration and hypoxia. The flexion withdrawal response (4) indicates some level of cortical function, but the overall score reflects significant neurological compromise.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* A GCS score of 8 or less warrants immediate airway management. Serial GCS assessments are crucial in monitoring trends and guiding interventions in patients with traumatic brain injuries. Early identification of declining GCS scores can prompt timely interventions to mitigate secondary brain injury.\n\n**SBAR Example:**\n*   **Situation:** Client with TBI, GCS score declining.\n*   **Background:** Initial GCS 15 at 1000, decreased to 13 at 1200, now 8 at 1400. Showing decreased responsiveness.\n*   **Assessment:** GCS 8 (E2, V2, M4) at 1400. Pupils not assessed in this data. Likely increasing ICP.\n*   **Recommendation:** STAT neuro consult, prepare for intubation, CT scan of head, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees, administer prescribed osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol) to reduce ICP."

Selecting this option demonstrates a failure to use the most current data to assess the client's condition. \n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* While a GCS of 13 reflects a mild-to-moderate brain injury, the subsequent drop to 8 signifies a rapid and dangerous neurological decline. This progression from 13 to 8 indicates that the primary brain injury is evolving with a secondary injury process, such as unchecked bleeding or swelling, which is causing progressive neuronal dysfunction and placing the client at imminent risk for brain herniation. The initial injury disrupts the blood-brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema, further exacerbating ICP.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Always prioritize the most recent assessment data. A change in GCS score, even a seemingly small one, can be clinically significant and requires immediate attention. Failure to recognize a declining GCS can lead to delayed interventions and poorer patient outcomes."

Choosing this option means the nurse has failed to recognize the client's acute deterioration.\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* In the context of head trauma, an initial GCS of 15 followed by a rapid decline can be characteristic of an epidural hematoma, where a 'lucid interval' occurs before the expanding arterial bleed causes significant mass effect, leading to a precipitous drop in consciousness. The rapid accumulation of blood between the skull and dura mater compresses the brain tissue, causing focal neurological deficits and decreased level of consciousness.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* Be vigilant for 'lucid intervals' following head trauma. These periods of apparent normalcy can be misleading and should not delay further evaluation and monitoring. Any deterioration in neurological status after a head injury should be treated as a medical emergency."

The client at 1400 is still demonstrating purposeful responses to pain (withdrawal flexion = 4) and vocalizing (incomprehensible sounds = 2).\n\n*Pathophysiology Rationale:* A score of 3 reflects profound bilateral hemispheric and/or brainstem damage, which is a more severe state than what is currently documented for this client. This level of impairment indicates widespread neuronal death and loss of function in critical areas of the brain responsible for consciousness, motor control, and sensory processing. Brainstem reflexes are typically absent at this level of GCS.\n\n*Clinical Pearl:* While a GCS of 3 indicates a very poor prognosis, it is essential to confirm the absence of reversible causes (e.g., drug overdose, hypothermia) before making definitive conclusions about brain death. A thorough neurological examination and ancillary testing (e.g., EEG, cerebral blood flow studies) are necessary to confirm brain death."
