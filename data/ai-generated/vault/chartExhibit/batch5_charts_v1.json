Second, the associated fluid volume loss (hypovolemia) triggers the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to conserve sodium and water, but in doing so, it promotes the excretion of potassium (K+) and hydrogen ions (H+). This renal excretion of H+ in the presence of systemic alkalosis is termed 'paradoxical aciduria' and serves to perpetuate the metabolic alkalosis.",

It indicates a lack of respiratory compensation, which is common in the acute phase. The respiratory system would eventually try to compensate by hypoventilating to retain CO2, but this response is often limited and delayed.",

The rapid decline from 15 to 8 suggests escalating intracranial pressure (ICP) from a mechanism like an expanding hematoma or severe cerebral edema. This increased pressure compresses brain structures, particularly the reticular activating system in the brainstem responsible for consciousness, leading to the observed decreased level of responsiveness.
