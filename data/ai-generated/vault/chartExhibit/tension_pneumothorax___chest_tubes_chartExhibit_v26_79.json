      "SBAR": "14:00 Report:\nSituation: Mr. Johnson, 62-year-old male, post-MVA, intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is restless and agitated.\nBackground: Admitted 2 hours ago with multiple rib fractures and a right hemopneumothorax. A 28 French chest tube was inserted in the ED. Initial output was 300 mL of blood. Patient has a history of COPD managed with inhalers.\nAssessment: HR 140 bpm, BP 90/50 mmHg, RR 32 and labored, SpO2 88% despite 100% FiO2. Trachea deviated to the left. No breath sounds on the right side. Chest tube output has decreased to 10 mL in the last hour. Subcutaneous emphysema is palpable around the chest tube insertion site. ABG: pH 7.20, PaCO2 60, PaO2 55, HCO3 24.\nRecommendation: Suspect tension pneumothorax. Stat chest X-ray and consider needle thoracostomy.",

The patient's clinical presentation (tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds, hypoxia, hypotension) strongly suggests a tension pneumothorax, making immediate intervention crucial. This buys time for definitive treatment with a chest tube."
