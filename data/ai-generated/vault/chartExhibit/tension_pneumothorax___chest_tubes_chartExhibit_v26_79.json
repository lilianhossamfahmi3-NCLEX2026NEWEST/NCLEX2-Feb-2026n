He is increasingly restless and agitated.\nBackground: Admitted with multiple rib fractures and a right hemopneumothorax. A 28 French chest tube was inserted in the ED with an initial output of 300 mL of blood. His history includes COPD managed with inhalers.\nAssessment: HR 140 bpm, BP 90/50 mmHg, RR 32 and labored, SpO2 88% on 100% FiO2. Trachea is deviated to the left. There are no breath sounds on the right side. Chest tube output is 10 mL in the last hour. Subcutaneous emphysema is palpable around the chest tube insertion site. ABG: pH 7.20, PaCO2 60 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L.\nRecommendation: Suspect a tension pneumothorax. Request a stat chest X-ray and consider immediate needle thoracostomy.",

The patient's clinical presentation (tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds, hypoxia, hypotension) strongly suggests a tension pneumothorax, necessitating immediate pressure relief to allow for lung re-expansion and improved venous return. This intervention provides immediate relief while definitive treatment with a chest tube is prepared.
