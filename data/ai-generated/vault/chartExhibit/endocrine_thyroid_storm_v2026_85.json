Key indicators include high fever (104.8°F), severe tachycardia (164 bpm), and agitation/delirium. The highest priority is to block the systemic effects of the hormone using beta-blockers (propranolol) and to lower the dangerously high temperature. Untreated thyroid storm can lead to heart failure and death within hours.",
