The elevated serum glucose (742 mg/dL) leads to glycosuria (Urine Glucose 4+). This causes osmotic diuresis, resulting in significant fluid loss (Output 5,200 mL), leading to dehydration (Weight loss, Low BP, High HR, parched mucous membranes). The absence of ketones (a3) excludes DKA, and the elevated serum osmolality (350 mOsm/kg) confirms the hyperosmolar state.",
