He was admitted 24 hours ago for observation following a recent pneumonia diagnosis.\nBackground: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He completed antibiotics for pneumonia three weeks ago. Initially, he presented with a productive cough and shortness of breath, which seemed to resolve with treatment.\nAssessment: Mr. Johnson exhibits labored breathing, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. He is alert but anxious. A recent chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates. ABG results: pH 7.30, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L.\nRecommendation: I recommend immediate intervention, including increasing oxygen support and considering mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation for ARDS is warranted. Please assess and advise on the best course of action.",
