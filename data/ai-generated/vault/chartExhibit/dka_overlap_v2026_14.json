Subcutaneous insulin (especially basal insulin like Glargine) takes time to be absorbed and reach a therapeutic level in the blood. Because IV insulin has a very short half-life (minutes), stopping it at the same time as the SQ dose is given creates an 'insulin gap,' which can trigger a rapid return to ketosis. Standard practice is to continue the IV drip for 1–2 hours after the first SQ dose.",
