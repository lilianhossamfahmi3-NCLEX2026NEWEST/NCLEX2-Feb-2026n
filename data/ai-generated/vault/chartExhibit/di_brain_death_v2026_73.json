        "correct": "The correct answer is **Terminal diabetes insipidus (DI) (a1)**. When a patient becomes brain dead, the pituitary gland stops functioning and ceases all ADH production. This leads to 'uncontrolled' urination (1,500 mL/hr) and a rapid rise in serum sodium (158 mEq/L). Without the antidiuretic hormone, the patient loses a large amount of fluid, leading to hypovolemic shock. In organ donors, this must be treated aggressively with fluids and IV vasopressin to keep the organs perfused for transplantation.",
