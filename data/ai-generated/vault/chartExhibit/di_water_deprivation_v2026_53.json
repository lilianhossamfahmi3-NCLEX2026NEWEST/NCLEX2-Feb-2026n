The Water Deprivation Log shows that after desmopressin administration, the urine osmolality increased significantly (from 115 mOsm/kg to 680 mOsm/kg). This indicates that the kidneys are capable of concentrating urine when stimulated by ADH. In Central Diabetes Insipidus, the body does not produce enough ADH. Therefore, administering desmopressin (synthetic ADH) allows the kidneys to concentrate urine. If the client had Nephrogenic DI, the kidneys would not respond to desmopressin, and the urine osmolality would not increase. In Psychogenic Polydipsia, the kidneys are functioning normally, and the urine would concentrate during the water deprivation phase.",
