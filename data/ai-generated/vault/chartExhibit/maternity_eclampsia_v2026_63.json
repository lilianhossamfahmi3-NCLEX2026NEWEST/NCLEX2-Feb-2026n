While hypertension and proteinuria are components of preeclampsia, hyperreflexia (4+) and ankle clonus (involuntary rhythmic muscle contractions) indicate extreme central nervous system (CNS) irritability, the final stage before a seizure (eclampsia). The headache and scotoma (seeing spots) further support cerebral edema.",
