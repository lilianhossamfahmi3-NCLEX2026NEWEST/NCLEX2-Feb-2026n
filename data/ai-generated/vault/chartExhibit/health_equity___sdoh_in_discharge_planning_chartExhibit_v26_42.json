            "SBAR": "**07:00 Report – Ms. Eleanor Vance**\n\n**Situation:** Ms. Vance, a 78-year-old African American female, was admitted three days ago for acute heart failure exacerbation. She presented with severe shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and orthopnea.\n\n**Background:** Ms. Vance has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III. She lives alone in subsidized housing and has limited social support. Her EF is 35%. She has difficulty managing her medications due to cost and transportation issues. The patient reports occasional food insecurity.\n\n**Assessment:** Ms. Vance’s dyspnea has improved with IV diuretics and oxygen therapy. Edema is reduced. Current vitals: BP 140/90, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 95% on room air. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. She is alert and oriented. Labs show improved kidney function and stable electrolytes. She expresses concern about managing her medications and diet at home. She demonstrates poor understanding of sodium restriction and medication adherence. She mentions difficulty affording healthy food options.\n\n**Recommendation:** I recommend a comprehensive discharge plan including: medication reconciliation, social work consult for assistance with medication costs and transportation, dietary education focusing on low-sodium options, home health referral for follow-up monitoring and medication management, and referral to community resources for food assistance. Please address her understanding of her medication regimen and dietary restrictions prior to discharge.",

            "Social work consult for medication assistance": "CORRECT: A social work consult can help address the patient's financial difficulties in affording medications, promoting medication adherence and preventing readmission.",
            "Referral to community food bank": "CORRECT: Given the patient's reported food insecurity, a referral to a food bank addresses a critical social determinant of health, ensuring access to nutritious food and supporting overall health.",
            "Home health referral": "CORRECT: Home health services provide ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition, medication management, and reinforcement of dietary and lifestyle modifications, crucial for preventing complications and readmission.",
            "Medication reconciliation": "CORRECT: Medication reconciliation ensures that the patient understands her medication regimen and can manage it effectively at home, reducing the risk of medication errors and adverse events.",
            "Dietary education focusing on low-sodium diet": "CORRECT: Dietary education helps the patient adhere to a low-sodium diet, crucial for managing heart failure and preventing fluid overload.",
            "Transportation assistance program": "CORRECT: Transportation assistance addresses the barrier of getting to appointments, follow-ups, and pharmacy to get medications filled, all impacting health outcomes.",
            "Increase furosemide dose": "INCORRECT: Increasing the furosemide dose without assessment of current electrolyte balance and kidney function could lead to adverse effects like hypokalemia or dehydration.",
            "Discharge without further intervention": "INCORRECT: Discharging the patient without addressing her social determinants of health and providing appropriate support increases the risk of readmission and poor health outcomes.",
            "Schedule follow-up appointment in 6 months": "INCORRECT: A follow-up appointment in 6 months is too long of an interval given the patient's recent exacerbation and complex health needs. More frequent monitoring is needed.",
            "Recommend over-the-counter herbal supplements": "INCORRECT: Recommending over-the-counter herbal supplements without consulting the healthcare provider could lead to interactions with her prescribed medications and adverse effects.",
            "Encourage enrollment in a gym membership": "INCORRECT: While physical activity is beneficial, a gym membership may not be feasible for the patient due to cost or transportation issues. More accessible and affordable options should be explored.",
            "Instruct patient to weigh themselves once per month": "INCORRECT: For heart failure patients, daily weight monitoring is crucial for detecting early signs of fluid retention. A monthly frequency is insufficient."
